   After months of appearing paralyzed by
President Bush's high poll ratings, the Democrats have shifted into
a campaign mode and begun to sound like a party ready to challenge
Bush in the 1992 election.
   During weekend meetings in New Orleans and Indianapolis, the
Democrats took on the popular Republican president on a range of
domestic issues including Social Security, the environment,
abortion and education.
   The party's newly aggressive stance was not arrived at easily.
It exposed the differing approaches of state party officials hungry
for effective campaign issues and the congressional wing, whose
members must often search for compromises with their Republican
colleagues and the White House.
   Regardless of their differences on specific issues, the
Democrats clearly agreed with party Chairman Ronald H. Brown's
assessment that the president has been getting a ``free ride'' and
that it was time to challenge him.
   The party officials gathered in Indianapolis for a meeting of
the Democratic National Committee, while the elected Democrats were
in New Orleans for a session convened by the Democratic Leadership
Council.
   Brown attended both meetings and was instrumental in pushing his
party to endorse Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut the
Social Security payroll tax _ a plan some of Moynihan's fellow
Democrats flatly oppose.
   ``I'm not concerned there is going to be a debate,'' Brown told
a news conference on the closing day of the DNC meeting. ``There
ought to be a debate.''
   The chairman was asked if he would feel a litle uncomfortable
with the stand of his party if he were an elected official _ say
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who is decidedly unethusiastic about
the proposal by his New York colleague.
   ``I think I'd feel good that my national party was committed to
winning elections,'' Brown replied.
   That response reflected the dominant view in Indianapolis: to
win elections, the Democrats must make clear to voters what they
stand for.
   It was with that in mind that Brown also stepped up his attacks
on the administration's record on the environment and education,
issues the president threatens to steal from the Democrats.
   Bush convened the governors for an education summit last fall
and rarely misses an opportunity to proclaim himself the
``education president.''
   He recently pleased environmentalists by endorsing legislation
to upgrade the Environmental Protection Agency to a Cabinet
department.
   ``We're not satisfied with sound bites and press conferences
about education when children in Eastern Europe are outscoring
American kids on standardized science exams, and 60 million
Americans can't read at an eighth-grade level,'' Brown told the DNC.
   He was equally scornful of the administration record on the
environment. He recalled the Bush campaign commercials on pollution
in Boston Harbor and chided the president for failing to clean it
up.
   Party officials recognized the risk of endorsing strong action
on Social Security.
   ``I think it's a little bit of a dangerous issue,'' said Jim
Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic Party chairman and president of the
Association of Democratic State Chairs.
   Ruvolo said the Democrats must be careful not to allow the
Republicans to ``frame the debate as the Democrats are threatening
Social Security. We know what kind of issue that is.''
   Throughout the 1980s, even at the height of Ronald Reagan's
popularity, Social Security was an issue that won votes for the
Democrats because some elderly voters were convinced that Reagan
wanted to freeze benefits.
   ``The cornerstone of the Moynihan proposal is to say this fund
ought to be sacrosanct,'' said Brown. The proposal, however, has
not received strong support from groups representing the elderly.
   The Democrats are hoping they can calm the fears of the elderly
that Moynihan's plan would lead to a freeze or cutback in benefits.
At the same time, the Democrats are banking on the appeal of
cutting the payroll tax, which has risen steadily for several years.
   Brown had another weekend victory when he got his party to act
quickly and quietly to set the rules for the 1992 campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``This is the most peaceful accord on rules we have had in the
past two decades,'' he said with obvious satisfaction.
   What made the Democrats so willing to adopt their chairman's
strategy?
   The answer might lie in the underlying unease felt by many at
the DNC meeting.
   Despite election successes in 1989 races, Democrats can't escape
the reality of their national election losses.
   ``We are not the majority party in this country,'' said Rep.
Sander Levin of Michigan, challenging a basic Democratic tenet.
``The party that loses five of six presidential elections is not
the majority party.''

   Veteran Northwest Airlines pilot Robert Ralph
Johnson was so drunk leaving a racquet club that he fell on his way
to his car. A judge would later say it was amazing he could walk at
all.
   But the judge sealed police and court records to keep Northwest
and the Federal Aviation Administration from learning of the case
in exchange for a guilty plea to driving while intoxicated in July
1988.
   The reasons: to save Johnson's job and to get him into a
treatment program. Johnson continued to fly for Northwest, as he
had for almost 30 years, the Star Tribune reported Sunday.
   The issue of pilot drunkenness gained new attention with the
arrest March 8 of three other Northwest airmen. They were accused
of drinking before a flight that day and of flying a plane with 91
passengers aboard while intoxicated.
   Northwest fired Captain Norman Prouse, First Officer Robert
Kirchner and Second Officer Joseph Balzer, who allegedly had
blood-alcohol levels above .04 percent, the legal limit for pilots,
officials said.
   The Star Tribune said at least 41 pilots of passenger aircraft,
including 28 employed by Northwest, have lost their Minnesota
driver's licenses in the past seven years because of alcohol abuse.
   In Johnson's case, if Eagan-based Northwest had learned of the
incident, he could have been grounded for at least two years under
a strict alcohol policy that since has been relaxed.
   If convicted of an alcohol-related traffic offense, Johnson
would have been required by the FAA to report it on his medical
exam, raising the possibility that his fitness to fly would be
examined.
   But following Johnson's guilty plea, Hennepin County District
Court Judge David Duffy decided not to accept it, Timothy Ostroot,
Johnson's lawyer, told The Associated Press. As part of the deal,
the judge ordered Johnson to complete alcohol treatment and stay in
contact with a probation officer.
   If Johnson upholds his part of the agreement, the judge will
dismiss the case in July without ever convicting Johnson of drunken
driving, Ostroot said.
   Northwest and FAA officials declined to comment on the report,
as did a national spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Eden Prairie police had stopped Johnson from driving his car out
of the racquet club's parking lot; a breath test showed he had a
.33 percent blood-alcohol content.
   ``Nothing is to be disclosed to anybody regarding this,'' Duffy
said during a hearing, according to the newspaper. ``And that would
include the FAA. And that does not go on the driving record. It
goes nowhere but here.''
   When Duffy asked what the FAA could do, Johnson answered, ``If
it doesn't get out of this room, they would never know.''
   Duffy opened the file last week to a Star Tribune reporter who
challenged the legality of sealing the records.
   While Johnson avoided FAA scrutiny through that unusual court
ruling, other pilots do so in a more routine way, the Star Tribune
said.
   In reviewing Northwest pilots' driving records, the newspaper
found seven cases in which alcohol-related charges were reduced to
non-alcohol offenses, such as careless driving. One was reduced to
a charge of running a red light.
   With alcohol removed from the convictions, the pilots were under
no obligation to tell the FAA they were involved in a
drunken-driving case, thus avoiding evaluation of their alcohol use.
   Should such an evaluation show them to be alcoholic, they could
be suspended from flying until they could prove they could overcome
alcoholism and abstained from drinking for two years, the Star
Tribune said.
   Duffy said last week he sealed Johnson's records because it was
the only way to get him to plead guilty and go into treatment,
without costing him his job.
   Under the old Northwest policy, Duffy said, if a pilot ``pled
guilty to drunk driving, he lost his job. Or if he went into
treatment, he lost his job. Under those circumstances, nobody was
going to plead guilty.''
   By this July, if Johnson has met the conditions set by the
judge, his case will be dismissed and his record will be clear.
Since he was sentenced, Johnson has completed treatment and
remained sober, Duffy said.
   Johnson's attorney, Timothy Ostroot, said Duffy's decision was
proper under the circumstances.
   ``This (the drinking incident) was completely unrelated to his
job,'' he said. ``There was never any allegation he was going to
fly the next day. ... To me, the price of losing his job, which he
worked very hard at and he was very good at, for an alcohol-related
incident ... would be a heavy price to pay.''

<HEAD>Gerald Bull, Weapons Designer and Arms Dealer, Dead at 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald Bull, a Canadian-born arms
dealer and weapons designer, was killed in his home, authorities
say. He was 62.
   Bull was shot to death Thursday night in his apartpment in a
fashionable suburb of Brussels. Police said they have ruled out
robbery as a motive because more than $20,000 was found in Bull's
pockets.
   Bull was convicted in Vermont in 1980 on charges of smuggling
arms to South Africa.
   The Canadian news agency Southam News, based in Ottawa, reported
Sunday that he had been working more recently with Iraq to help it
develop advanced weapons systems that were used in the Iran-Iraq
war.
   He also had extensive business dealings with Communist China,
Southam reported.
   The Belgian newspaper Derniere Heure said Bull had helped South
Africa develop the G5 long-range artillery gun. The Howitzer-type
guns were said to be more sophisticated than anything in either the
NATO or Warsaw Pact arsenals.
   But in a statement issued to the Belgian news agency, Bull's son
Stephen strongly denied that Space Research Corp., Bull's company,
or its foreign affiliates, were involved in arms dealing.
   ``The Space Research Corp. ... has never been involved in
activities breaking the (arms) embargo with South Africa,'' the
statement said.
   It said Bull for several years had been involved in aeronautic
and defense research.
   Bull was born in North Bay, Ontario, but gave up his Canadian
citizenship for a U.S. passport sometime before 1977, the Canadian
Embassy in Brussels said.
   Once tabbed by Maclean's magazine as Canada's boy genius of
rocket science, Bull became in 1951 the youngest person to graduate
from the University of Toronto with a doctorate. He was 22.
   He first appeared on the Vermont scene in 1967, when, as a
professor at McGill University in Montreal, he established an
aerospace science program at Norwich University in Northfield.
   In 1970, Bull began trying to perfect his plans to orbit nuclear
warheads in space.
   Although he was Canadian, Bull won access to highly classified
American military files. When the impropriety was discovered, a
special act of Congress sponsored by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.,
backdated his U.S. citizenship application.
   Only two other aliens, the Marquis de Lafayette and Winston
Churchill, have had such honorary citizenship bestowed upon them.
   Space Research ran into trouble in the mid-1970s, when it failed
to win the major military contracts it was seeking, and lost a $12
million contract to build 28 simulators for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The company's demise came after U.S. and Canadian authorities
and news media investigations found that it had struck a deal to
sell advanced Howitzer technology to the South African government,
in violation of U.S. munitions laws and a United Nations arms
embargo against the white minority-ruled country.
   Reports at the time indicated that the deal was accomplished
through shipments through ports in Antigua and Spain, commercial
jet flights from New York and Montreal and visits by Space Research
Engineers to a remote test range in South Africa.

<HEAD>Six Months Later, Hugo-Downed Timber Poses Fire Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after Tropical Storm Hugo's powerful
winds cut a swath of destruction through North Carolina, the big
threat now is forest fires.
   ``Mother Nature lashed out against us not once but twice,'' said
State Forester Harry Layman. ``First we got the hurricane and now
we've got to face the threat of forest fires.''
   Layman estimated that Hugo destroyed or damaged 2.7 million
acres of trees worth about $250 million. That's more timber than
was destroyed by the Mount St. Helen's volcano, the fires in
Yellowstone National Park and Hurricane Camille combined, he said.
   As the springtime temperatures begin to rise, tons of downed and
shattered pines, oaks, hickorys and other trees continue to pile up
and dry out on the floors of western North Carolina's mountains.
   It's the worst fire threat the state has ever faced, say Layman
and other experts. Authorities in South Carolina also are concerned.
   ``It's real bad this year and its going to get worse in the
second and third years,'' Layman said. ``Right now, the twigs and
branches are falling, providing lots of kindling. Later the big
trees are all going to be down. It's going to be a big bonfire.
   ``Any fire larger than five acres will soon be out of control
and turn into a holocaust,'' Layman said.
   Charlotte was in the direct path of the eye of the storm after
it came ashore 200 miles south near Charleston, S.C., in the
predawn hours of Sept. 22.
   While Hugo was officially downgraded from a hurricane to a
tropical storm just before it hit Charlotte, winds were clocked at
90 mph and higher when the eye of the storm passed just over the
western outskirts of the city.
   Piles of debris, including tree stumps, are still a common sight
on some streets. At some city parks, youngsters play baseball and
soccer games in open areas between large uprooted trees.
   The city has carted away an estimated 100,000 truckloads of Hugo
debris.
   Seven emergency landfills were opened to take the debris, and
four are already full.
   ``We're still getting 250 to 300 calls a day from people who
want us to come to their homes and take away their debris,'' said
Larry Johnson, assistant director of transportation, who's in
charge of the remaining cleanup.
   Back in the forests, officials are preparing for a dry spring.
   Using a $3.3 million grant from the Federal Emergency Managment
Administration, 65 additional firefighters were hired. Abandoned
fire towers were reactivated and new equipment _ including
helicopters and bulldozers _ were brought in.
   The state leased a tanker plane from the Quebec government;
South Carolina has leased two of the planes.
   The North Carolina Forestry Division has two planes combing the
path of the storm looking for any signs of fire.
   ``We're working our hearts out to open up as many (fire) trails
as we can,'' Layman said. ``But we need 500 miles of trails in
Burke County alone and our crew can only do two miles a day.''
   The state may use prisoners to help clear paths into the forests
that were blocked by downed trees.
   Timber companies are only able to clear about 7 percent of the
damaged trees.
   Layman is considering imposing a strict burning ban beginning
next month. ``The worst time is April and May,'' he said. ``We're
hoping Mother Nature will cooperate, but sooner or later we're
going to face it.''

<HEAD>Illegal Aliens: Census Will Include Them in Count</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If one state includes 5 million U.S. citizens
and another has 4 million citizens and 1 million illegal aliens,
which gets more seats in the House of Representatives?
   The answer: they both get the same.
   That's not fair, say politicians from states that don't have
many undocumented residents. But that's what the Constitution
requires, respond their counterparts in states with large numbers
of them.
   The dispute has provoked battles in federal court and Congress
as the Census Bureau prepares to go forth and count Americans once
again. The national head count, taken every 10 years, got under way
last week.
   The results will be used to redistribute seats in the House in
1992, and officials in states that have few illegal aliens fear
losing political influence to states with many undocumented
residents.
   The number of House seats assigned to each state depends only on
the total population of that state, whether composed of citizens,
legal resident aliens or the undocumented.
   ``The question is simple. Are people who have entered our
country illegally entitled to representation in the United States
Congress? I say no,'' Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said recently in
remarks echoed by Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., and others.
   Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., contended that including
illegal aliens gives undue influence to the citizens who live near
them. Because non-citizens cannot vote, it would take fewer
citizens to elect a congressman in a district with a lot of aliens
than in one with few, Goodling said.
   Ridge fought a losing battle in the House to require the Census
Bureau to ask people if they are here legally, and then to leave
who aren't out of the numbers used for apportionment.
   A lawsuit filed by Ridge and 41 other House members seeking the
same result also was dismissed by a federal judge in Pittsburgh.
   Despite the defeats, he hasn't given up, said aide Mark
Campbell. It's too late to have changes made in the 1990 census,
but Ridge is now aiming at the next count, in the year 2000.
   ``Congress cannot by legislative action make persons into
non-persons for its political purposes,'' Rep. Esteban E. Torres,
D-Calif., argued for those who want an all-inclusive count
   He stressed that while the Constitution requires citizenship for
certain public offices, it specifically calls for the counting of
all ``persons'' in the census.
   A proposal to base House apportionment only on citizens was
rejected a century ago, when Northern states included many new
immigrants, noted Arturo Vargas of the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Education Fund.
   ``Excluding undocumented residents from census counts would
compel the Census (Bureau) to adopt untested techniques to
determine the citizenship and immigration status of every person
counted in the census,'' Vargas said.
   This, he said, could have a ``chilling effect'' on the Hispanic
community, discouraging participation of many legal residents.
   Trying to count legal and illegal residents separately ``will
only lead to misrepresentation and inaccuracy, both in the count
numbers and in the reapportionment process,'' said Jaime B. Fuster,
Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington.
   Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby, whose department
includes the Census Bureau, said, ``We believe there are compelling
legal and public policy grounds for counting all persons
irrespective of their citizenship.''
   Changing the policy of counting everyone would undermine efforts
to get a complete census, would discourage participation of
minorities and could damage public perception of census
confidentiality, said Darby.
   In addition, he said, there is no effective way to know who is
legal and who isn't. Of all the questions on the long and short
forms, none asks people if they reside in the country legally.
   However, estimates developed in 1985 indicated that excluding
illegal aliens from the 1980 national head count would have
affected two House seats.
   Then-Census Director John G. Keane told a Senate subcommittee
that the bureau estimated that it had counted 2 million illegal
residents in 1980.
   Had those people not been counted, he said, New York and
California would each have lost one House seat, with those seats
going to Georgia and Indiana. Keane stressed, however, that his
estimates were not accurate enough to use in actual
reapportionments.
   To the Census Bureau it doesn't really matter. The Constitution
simply directs them to count all the people residing in the country.
   A lot of illegal aliens will probably try to avoid the census
anyway, officials acknowledge. Wary of government efforts to return
them to their homelands, these people are often reluctant to deal
with officials despite promises than any answers they give will be
kept confidential.

   Former President Nixon says that he expects
historians to judge him more by Watergate than by his diplomatic
overtures to China.
   ``Historians are more likely to lead with `He resigned the
office,''' Nixon said in an interview in the latest issue of Time
magazine. ``The jury has already come in, and there's nothing
that's going to change it. There's no appeal. Historians will judge
it harshly.''
   Nixon discussed the Watergate break-in in his new book ``In the
Arena,'' excerpted in the magazine.
   The former president said he made the ``inexcusable error'' of
asking the CIA to block an FBI probe of the Watergate break-in, but
that the CIA declined.
   Nixon said a decision by then-CIA Director Richard Helms and his
deputy, Vernon Walters, to ignore the request discredits
Watergate's ``most serious myth _ the one that ultimately forced me
to resign:'' that the CIA in fact obstructed the FBI probe on his
orders.

<HEAD>US Policy Refocusing on Salvadoran Situation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With Nicaragua and Panama added to the
democratic column, U.S. policy in Central America is focusing anew
on the hottest remaining trouble spot: tiny, war-torn El Salvador.
   A shadow version of El Salvador's conflict is being played out
in Washington, between supporters of the current government who
argue for more time to resolve the country's decade-old civil war,
and opponents who want to immediately cut or attach strings to U.S.
military aid.
   The issue has been taken to the streets as well as the halls of
government.
   About 10,000 people calling for a halt to military aid marched
in front of the White House on Saturday and 5,000 participated in a
similar demonstration in San Francisco. Police arrested 83
protesters at the Washington march for demonstrating without a
permit and blocking traffic.
   The clash over aid is occurring at a particularly delicate time
in El Salvador. The two warring sides have agreed to come together
for peace talks under United Nations auspices, and as a scheduled
trial approaches for the military officers accused of murdering six
Jesuit priests.
   In addition, the leftist FMLN rebels are under pressure as never
before to make concessions. The electoral defeat last month of the
Sandinista government in neighboring Nicaragua is expected to close
off their most reliable military supply line.
   ``I honestly believe conditions have never been better in the
history of this conflict than they are right now,'' Bernard
Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
said last week. ``I think we can end this war this year.''
   But Aronson added: ``If it becomes politicized ... we will once
again screw it up.''
   Liberals on Capitol Hill claim broad support for an effort to
impose strict new conditions on U.S. aid to El Salvador, which is
among the largest per-capita recipients of American largesse.
Military, economic, development and food aid total $315.4 million
this year to the nation of 5 million, and President Bush has asked
for about $375 million next year.
   Opponents contend that nearly $4 billion in aid over the past
decade has not bought an end to the war that has claimed some
70,000 lives, and that the Salvadoran military remains beyond the
control of the civilian government and prone to human rights abuses
and death-squad activity.
   House supporters of aid restrictions are drafting legal language
that would withhold half of the money that goes to the Salvadoran
military _ $84.6 million this year, an expected $90 million next
year _ and make its release dependent on both sides' behavior.
   The provision, a variation of legislation introduced in the
Senate by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is aimed at adding
pressure to keep both sides at the bargaining table and to minimize
hostilities in the field.
   Those who would restrict the military aid see the potential for
strong leverage with Bush if they succeed in adding their proposal
to an $870 million supplemental appropriations bill the president
is seeking to reward new democracies in Panama and Nicaragua.
   The administration believes that the new governments of
President Guillermo Endara in Panama and President-elect Violeta
Chamorro in Nicaragua could falter unless they are able to quickly
demonstrate tangible benefits of democracy to their people. The aid
would go to revitalize Panama's private sector and to plant spring
crops and create jobs in Nicaragua's devastated economy.
   But with the backing of House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the
administration is hoping to defer any fight over U.S. policy toward
El Salvador.
   When the Panama-Nicaragua bill came before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee last week, Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
pleaded with liberals to attach their restrictive language to an
aid measure for fiscal year 1991, rather than the emergency funding
bill.
   Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the panel's senior
Republican, promised that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
would come to Capitol Hill this week to hear the liberals'
concerns. Fascell vowed that the fiscal 1991 aid bill would not
become sidetracked, as a similar measure did last year.
   The bill-drafting session broke up without agreement, and is
scheduled to resume on Tuesday. But regardless of the outcome
there, the same issues are virtually certain to arise when the
Panama-Nicaragua bill goes to the Senate sometime in the next two
weeks.

<TEXT>
   Ever since Thomas Foley took over as its
speaker last June, the House of Representatives has enjoyed
uncommon cooperation and goodwill between the majority Democrats
and minority Republicans.
   It appears this unnatural state of affairs is finally coming to
an end.
   To the casual observer, the House chamber always seems a civil
place, and that's not going to change. Lawmakers address each other
as ``the gentleman from Kentucky'' or ``the distinguished
gentlewoman from California.'' They can pile on the politeness,
especially when angry.
   But there is a natural partisan tension behind the smiling
facades. It isn't often the stuff of headlines, just a
parliamentary bully match in which each side puts a finger on the
chest of the other.
   This sort of partisanship peaked during former Speaker Jim
Wright's reign. Toward the end, Wright was barely on speaking terms
with Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. Near-monolithic
Republican contempt for Wright helped hasten his resignation after
the House ethics committee hit him with a list of charges.
   The ever-courteous Foley, D-Wash., was greeted by the
Republicans in the House the way Mikhail Gorbachev has been
received by Western Europe.
   The natural enemies began speaking warmly of each other. They
held frequent ``summits'' on the issues of the day.
   Oh, there were some ideological battles, such as the fight over
President Bush's capital gains tax. But the hallmark of the
post-Wright House has been collaboration, culminating with
bipartisan passage last fall of the big pay raise for House members.
   The GOP's leading Democrat-basher, Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
capped the year with a resolution honoring Foley.
   The warm, snugly feeling lasted through Congress' long winter
recess and almost into the spring.
   Then, last week, it began to crack.
   Foley, under election-year pressure to finish work on child care
legislation, put the Democratic bill on last week's schedule. The
measure wasn't ready, but he wanted to pressure his own Democrats
to settle differences that had been delaying action since last year.
   Everyone from the speaker down to the doorkeepers recognized
that the schedule was just a parliamentary ploy. Nevertheless,
House Republicans who had gone too long without a good spat took
offense that they weren't consulted about the schedule change.
   ``I think up until now that we thought we had been treated
fairly ... as partners in the legislative process,'' said Rep.
Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, a member of the GOP leadership.
``That partnership seems to have been unilaterally dissolved.''
   The Republicans soon got revenge.
   Without fanfare, and without telling the Republicans, the House
counsel asked the Supreme Court to delay until fall its
consideration of the federal anti-flag burning statute that
Congress passed last year. Two lower courts have ruled it
unconstitutional.
   In the logic of politics, Republicans are hoping that the
flag-protection law is thrown out _ the flag left unprotected _
before the fall elections. They then could force a House vote on a
flag-protection constitutional amendment supported by President
Bush.
   Many Democrats last year were willing to approve a
flag-protection statute, but didn't want to alter the Constitution
and especially the Bill of Rights. If the court throws out the law,
Republicans then could attack them as unpatriotic unless they vote
for the amendment.
   Michel, angry that he wasn't consulted before the counsel asked
for a court delay, saw a political opportunity and introduced a
resolution ordering the brief withdrawn.
   Democratic leaders tried to fight it, but their parliamentary
maneuvering backfired. A series of House votes culminated in a
309-101 victory for Michel and a trouncing for Foley.
   The embarrassment brought the speaker to the House floor to
defend his motives.
   ``I emphatically state that there was no political and is no
political motive in the filing of this brief other than to
undertake the fullest defense of a statute of this House,'' Foley
said. He quickly met with the Republican leaders and a new brief
was sent, minus the section on delaying court review.
   Michel, meeting with reporters after the vote, conceded the
issue could have been handled ``much more simply.''
   But then the Republicans would have been denied a chance to make
the Democrats squirm, a morale-booster in short supply for the GOP
minority.
   And Foley's Democrats wouldn't have learned something about the
limits of their majority and party loyalty in the face of political
threat.
   There's little threat that the House will soon return to the
animosity of the days of Jim Wright. But perhaps the natural
tension that keeps lawmakers sharp and the House an interesting
place to watch has returned.

   Gov. William A. O'Neill's decision not to
run for re-election is tempting various would-be Democratic
successors and strengthening the hand of Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the
former Republican senator.
   Weicker, running as an independent, is leading in the polls for
what promises to be a tough three-way gubernatorial race.
   U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, a four-term liberal congressman,
has been campaigning against O'Neill for several months on the
Democratic side.
   O'Neill's moderate-to conservatives backers have been touting
Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, a popular four-term congresswoman who is
the daughter of the late national Democratic Chairman John M.
Bailey. But Kennelly has refused to run against Morrison,
preferring to stay in Washington, where she is viewed as a rising
star.
   None of the Democrats drawn into the race since O'Neill's
announcement have significant statewide recognition.
   They include state Rep. William J. Cibes Jr. of New London, who
announced two hours after O'Neill withdrew. His platform includes a
proposal for a state income tax that has proved politically
unfeasible in the past.
   O'Neill became governor on Dec. 31, 1980, when Gov. Ella T.
Grasso resigned because of poor health. He was elected to four-year
terms in 1982 and 1986.
   In withdrawing, O'Neill said he wanted to avoid the nasty
campaign he assumed would be directed at him, chiefly for the way
he has handled the state's crumbling finances.
   O'Neill and the Democrats who control the General Assembly
raised taxes last year by almost $1 billion. Big deficit problems
remain this year.
   The Republicans, who have won the governor's office only once
since 1954, had dreams of victory with the vulnerable O'Neill as
the Democratic candidate.
   But that was before Weicker, who lost a 1988 Senate re-election
bid, announced his candidacy on March 2.
   During 18 years as a liberal Republican senator, Weicker pulled
votes from among the state's 700,000 Democrats, 485,000
Republicans, and 600,000 unaffiliated voters.
   Other Demococrats mentioned as possible candidates include
former West Hartford Mayor Christopher Droney, brother of state
Democratic Chairman John F. Droney Jr.; Senate President Pro Tem
John B. Larson of East Hartford; and state Treasurer Francisco L.
Borges.
   Any candidate receiving the support of 20 percent of the
delegates to the Democrats' summer convention can qualify for
September's primary.
   Things are far quieter on the Republican front, where U.S. Rep.
John G. Rowland, a three-term congressman, has been leading the
race for months.
   His campaign has been based entirely on the O'Neill record. Now,
he'll have to look elsewhere for issues.
   Two are ready made for him: Morrison's perceived liberal record
in Congress and the tax increases of the past year in Hartford,
shaped by some of the other Democrats thinking about running,
including Cibes and Larson.
   Trailing far behind Rowland for the GOP nomination are state
Senate Minority Leader Reginald J. Smith of New Hartford; Joel
Schiavone, a millionaire developer from New Haven; and Joseph
McGee, a bank vice president from Fairfield.
   Financial matters dominate the campaign. Abortion has not become
much of an issue in this strong pro-choice state.

<HEAD>California Tops Again in Farm Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California was the top farm export state in
1989 for the fifth consecutive year, leading Nebraska, Iowa,
Kansas, Texas and Illinois, according to Agriculture Department
estimates.
   Analysts in the department's Economic Research Service listed
California at the top of the export chart for the first time in
1985, replacing perennial winners Iowa and Illinois.
   California has many high-value crops such as fruits, nuts,
vegetables and seeds. Thus, as foreign demand builds for those
items, so do their export values.
   The ratings included the top 15 states during the fiscal year
that ended last Sept. 30, when export values totaled nearly $39.7
billion, up from $35.4 billion in 1988.
   In all, the 15 states accounted for more than 71 percent of the
total U.S. export value last year, about the same proportion as in
1988.
   Only Minnesota showed a decline last year, with the state's
export value dropping 2 percent to about $1.76 billion from
slightly more than $1.8 billion in 1988.
   ``The drop in Minnesota was mainly because of the emphasis the
state puts on soybeans, and soybean export dropped tremendously,''
said analyst Steve Milmoe of the USDA agency.
   Milmoe, in a telephone interview, said total U.S. soybean export
values dropped $1.2 billion last year from about $7 billion in
1988. Thus, Minnesota's share declined accordingly.
   Illinois, another huge soybean producer, was reported at $2.63
billion, virtually unchanged from 1988.
   The annual rankings are not meant to be absolute, since USDA
does not monitor state origins as products move into export
channels. Mostly, the estimates are based on an assumption that
each state's contribution to exports is equal to its share of
production and marketing.
   According to the report, last year's top 15 export states, in
order, in millions of dollars, and their percentage increase (a
decrease for Minnesota) from 1988, included:
   1. California: 3,561; 5 percent.
   2. Nebraska: 2,984; 41.
   3. Iowa: 2,978; 5.
   4. Kansas: 2,845; 22.
   5. Texas: 2,640; 17.
   6. Illinois: 2,638; unchanged.
   7. Minnesota: 1,763; -2.
   8. Indiana: 1,424; 3.
   9. Washington: 1,242; 53.
   10. Missouri: 1,225; 11.
   11. Arkansas: 1,212; 34.
   12. Ohio: 1,160; 6.
   13. North Carolina: 918; 5.
   14. Colorado: 884; 31.
   15. Kentucky: 841; 15.

   The Agriculture Department is amending federal
regulations this week to allow the identification of swine shipped
across state lines at the first point of concentration after
leaving the farm.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said a final rule allowing the
change will be published on Tuesday.
   Previously, he said, hog producers were responsible in many
cases for identifying swine before the animals moved into
interstate commerce.
   But the changes are necessary ``to provide for effective
traceback of diseased or adulterated swine, without unnecessarily
disrupting standard marketing procedures,'' Glosser said.
   Federal rules requiring the interstate identification of swine
took effect in November 1988 to help the agency locate hogs
infected with disease. An exception was made for hogs moving
directly to slaughter plants from farrow-to-finish operations.
   The regulations define ``first points of concentration'' where
identification may be performed.
   For example, Glosser said that could include the point of first
gathering or commingling of swine from more than one source, such
as a truck picking up hogs from different farms for delivery to
market. Swine identified at this point could be traced directly
back to herds of origin.
   Glosser said the rules also clarify the agency's list of
approved devices used to identify swine in interstate commerce. The
devices, used to identify hogs being shipped to slaughter plants,
include tattoos and USDA backtags.

   Maybe it won't rank with Madonna or Janet
Jackson, but the producers of a new video about farming are hopeful.
   The 15-minute television production, ``America's Most Crucial
Industry,'' was created by the Agriculture Department to inform
groups of all ages about the contributions of the nation's
agriculture.
   Paul E. Kindinger, the department's director of public affairs,
said the video can be ``an excellent educational tool'' to help
explain the immensity of the U.S. agricultural system.
   The video was written by Vic Powell, chief of USDA's radio and
television division, and is narrated by Pat O'Leary, one of the
division's television producers.
   Copies are available on half-inch VHS tape for $12 each from:
Video Transfer, 5709-B Arundel Ave., Rockville, Md. 20852.

<HEAD>Postal Service Policy on Forwarding Mail Comes Under Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly-rights advocates are battling a
longstanding Postal Service policy they say treats nursing home
residents like prisoners by denying them the right to have their
mail automatically forwarded when they move.
   While other people may submit change-of-address cards to the
local post office, nursing home residents _ like inmates _ must
rely on the institution to write their new address on individual
letters.
   The policy is being questioned by activists in Florida and
Pennsylvania, and by members of a Senate panel.
   ``It would be much better if the post office could treat the
nursing home residents like any other citizens,'' said Daniel
Greenawalt, a state-employed ombudsman for the elderly in
Pennsylvania.
   Since residents of a nursing home are at the same address, the
Postal Service says the home should be ``the agent'' of their mail.
The mail is delivered in bulk, like at a prison, and then
distributed.
   Allowing nursing home residents to file address forwarding cards
``would mean the person doing the sorting in the postal facility
has to have a record of each person in the nursing home, where
there may be quite a deal of turnover _ not so much in moving but
in departing this earth,'' Postal Service spokesman Lou Eberhardt
said last week.
   When a resident moves, Eberhardt said, the nursing home need
only write the new address on letters, and the Postal Service will
redeliver the mail for free.
   ``I think it represents a minuscule problem for everyone
concerned,'' Eberhardt said. ``If we didn't forward mail free of
charge, it would then be an additional irritant. It's probably a
very short period of time before correspondents are advised that
the person has moved from one institution to another.''
   Eberhardt said the service wanted to be flexible about the
policy and could envision helping out, for example, in the event of
a nursing home bankruptcy.
   But Sister Mary Gregoria Rush of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
St. Petersburg, Fla., has been writing to the postmaster general
and members of Congress to try to get the policy changed.
   She recalled the case of Virginia Killilae, a 96-year-old former
circus publicist whose mail did not all follow her when she
transferred from one Florida nursing home to another. Some of the
letters were ``returned to sender'' because the post office did not
accept a forwarding address card and the institution was not always
cooperative, Sister Rush said.
   ``This lady had traveled all over the United States, and she had
all her mail stacked up and the date she received it and answered
it. But she spent many hours crying because she was so lonely,''
Sister Rush said. ``If I were a friend writing to a 96-year-old and
I got `Return to Sender,' I'd assume she was dead.''
   Republican staff members of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging recently prepared a memorandum concluding that the Postal
Service policy ``cannot be justified by arguments for the
convenience or efficiency of the institution or the post office.''
   As a result, Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., the panel's ranking
Republican, told Postmaster General Anthony Frank in a letter last
week:
   ``Mail service provides nursing home and mental health facility
residents with important links to the outside world. I question
whether these individuals should be classified with inmates, who
have lost important civil rights, or with short-term hospital
patients and other persons who maintain permanent addresses in the
community.''
   Heinz asked Frank to determine the cost of changing the policy.
   Heinz's letter is being considered by officials in the rates and
forwarding section of the Postal Service, spokesman Eberhardt said.

<HEAD>Teen Who Challenged License Law Turns 18; Eligible to Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID WILKISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who challenged the nation's
first law taking driving privileges from school dropouts becomes
eligible to get his license back today, but he'll keep fighting the
law.
   The West Virginia law, which has been copied by a number of
states including Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and Texas, suspends
the driver's license of minors who continually cut class.
   Its effectiveness ends when the dropout turns 18, as Michael
Means does today.
   ``If I have to work Monday, I'll work, but one of the main
things on the list is going to get the license,'' Means said as his
birthday approached. ``I think I'm just going to ride around the
courthouse several hundred times.''
   Means, who does odd jobs to support his family, expressed some
remorse for leaving school early.
   ``I know I lost something I can never regain, but they think
they can keep you in school by taking your license away and that's
not very bright,'' Means said. ``You can't train kids like you can
dogs by taking something away.''
   The law was passed by the Legislature in 1988 to help curb the
state's 17 percent dropout rate. It revokes students' licenses
until they are 18 if they miss more than 10 consecutive days of
school or have more than 15 unexcused absences.
   Means, a married father who gave up on a formal education at age
16, was among the first to become entangled in the law after he
lost his license and applied for a new one.
   The Department of Motor Vehicles, citing the dropout law,
refused to issue another license without the consent of the Kanawha
County Board of Education. And the school board rejected Means'
hardship argument that he was unable to support his family without
driving.
   Means took the officials to court, but he lost in circuit court
in August. He has appealed to the state Supreme Court, which is
likely to hear the case in September.
   Means' attorney, Chris Butch, argues it is illogical to take a
``shotgun approach'' to force teen-agers to return to school, while
at the same allowing them to drop out at age 16. Butch also argued
the policy is discriminatory because rural youths, unlike city
dwellers, lack access to public transportation. Means lives on the
outskirts of Charleston.
   Despite the controversy, education officials say the law has
helped trim the dropout rate to 16 percent.
   ``It's not the answer. It's another strategy we're using to help
deal with the dropout program,'' said Therese Wilson of the state
Department of Education.
   ``If we look at the number of kids who came back because of the
law ... when over 300 come back, that's 300 kids we would not have
gotten if it had not been for the law,'' she said.
   The law resulted in 687 suspensions for the 1988-89 school year,
said Tom Madden, general counsel for the motor vehicle division. By
the end of the year, nearly 250 of those teen-agers had their
licenses reinstated by returning to school or enrolling in a high
school equivalency degree program. Hardship exemptions were given
to 43, and 157 dropouts got their licenses back when they turned 18.
   Madden said 376 suspensions have been issued during the current
school year, and 74 young people got their licenses back by
returning to school or enrolling in an equivalency-degree program.
   Means, who lives in his parents' home with his 17-year-old wife,
also a dropout, and his 7-month-old son, said he would continue his
fight even though he now is old enough to get a license.
   ``I guess the only thing I really want is my license back, but I
just want to give other people a chance that don't have one,'' he
said.

   President Bush's highly publicized distaste for
broccoli will only increase consumption of the vitamin-rich
vegetable, one proponent says.
   ``It's wonderful stuff. We sell tons of it,'' said William
Quinn, produce manager for the Outpost Natural Foods supermarket.
   Asked if Bush's move to ban the vegetable from Air Force One's
larder might affect sales of broccoli, Quinn said: ``Yes, among our
customers, I think it will increase them.''
   ``The man can't enjoy one of the best fruits of the earth,''
piped in Harriet Behar, whose Sweet Earth Farm near Gays Mills in
southwestern Wisconsin markets about 15,000 broccoli plants
annually.
   Bush's thumbs-down for broccoli made headlines when he told
questioning reporters on Thursday, ``I do not like broccoli and I
haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat
it and I'm president of the United States and I'm not going to eat
any more broccoli.''

   Tommy Bengaff won $25,000 at a blackjack
table in Atlantic City, and forked out $23,000 of it on his
mother's 60th birthday bash.
   Melba Bengaff and 65 of her closest friends celebrated her
birthday in grand style in a Bellevue Avenue mansion.
   Her 25-year-old son laid on a five-piece band, 20 chauffeured
limousines and a $45-a-plate meal, put up five guests from New York
City at a hotel and arranged a family vacation on the Caribbean
island of Aruba.
   ``It's my mother's 60th birthday and she means the world to
me,'' Bengaff said. ``You only have one mom. Mom and I are like
brother and sister. I know if she had the money she'd do it for
me.''
   Bengaff, a $25,000-a-year manager at a grocery store in Cranston
and owner of King's West Bay Limousine Service, said that last
October ``it came into my mind that I wanted to do something big. I
just didn't know where or how big.''
   A three-hour visit at a blackjack table in Atlantic City on New
Year's Eve took care of the money problem.
   ``My father told me to save it or put into an IRA, not to spend
it on one night in Newport,'' Bengaff said.

   A social worker paid $3,000 for the
large wooden crate that was used to ship Charles Lindbergh's plane
back to the United States after his historic flight to Europe in
1927.
   Larry Ross, 38, of Canaan, Maine, the executive director of a
social service agency, said he is convinced the crate is
historically significant. He wants to renovate it as a summer
cottage.
   The crate has lain for years in woods near Contoocook, and has
been used by passers-by in search of free housing. It has windows
and a door, and at one time had electricity and a phone, but it has
fallen into disrepair in recent years.
   ``It's not an awful lot to look at,'' said Ross, who plans to
load up the crate early this week.
   Ross bought the crate from David Price Sr., who took possession
of it five years ago when he bought the land from the grandson of
Admiral Guy Burrage.
   Burrage's ship brought Lindbergh and the crate back to the
United States. They became friends, the aviator gave him the crate
and Burrage turned it into a summer cottage.
   Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean
from the United States to France in the Spirit of St. Louis.
   ``It struck me as a unique piece of Americana that has a certain
New England eccentricity to it,'' Ross said. ``Some people look at
me like, `Are you crazy?' Other people get a real charge out of
it.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says a Soviet
military crackdown in Lithuania would ``undermine a lot of the good
work'' done in recent years in improving U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Cheney said Sunday that a move to crush the independence
movement in the Baltic republic would have ``significant negative
consequences in terms of U.S.-Soviet relations'' on arms control
and other issues.
   And he said it ``obviously would undermine a lot of the good
work that's been done in recent years.''
   ``We'd like to see the Lithuanians ... granted the same
prerogative that the East Germans were: self-determination,''
Cheney said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program.
   President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
said Saturday that any Soviet use of force ``would be
counterproductive'' and that the United States ``would not ignore
it.''
   Bush himself had no comment Sunday on the situation in Lithuania
as he returned from a weekend at Camp David, his mountain retreat
in Maryland.
   Soviet troops occupied two communist schools in Vilnius, capital
of the Baltic state, on Sunday, one day after tanks rolled through
the streets in the middle of the night.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Kremlin
officials have been pressuring Lithuania's newly elected leaders to
back off attempts to secede.
   Bush said Friday that any Soviet attempt to ``intimidate or
forcibly intervene against the Lithuanian people is bound to
backfire.''
   The United States and the Western world have never recognized
the Soviet Union's forcible annexation of Lithuania and its sister
Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia, in 1940 as war swept over Europe.
   But the United States now says it will not grant formal
recognition until the breakaway republic establishes control over
its territory, and Bush has urged the Lithuanians to recognize
``certain realities'' about its relationship to Moscow.
   Asked if the United States had lured Lithuania into rebelling,
Cheney said, ``We have not been out actively soliciting revolution,
if you will. On the other hand, we've made it clear that we share
the aspirations of the Lithuanian people for self-determination.''

   After sitting through 15 acts over 2{ hours in
historic Ford's Theatre, President Bush quipped that Abraham
Lincoln ``would have really enjoyed this program _ parts of it.''
   The show was the annual presidential gala for Ford's Theatre
itself, which drew a black-tie crowd of more than 500 on Sunday
night, including Bush and his wife Barbara.
   The president's instant criticism evoked laughter. Bush also got
a loud hand when Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., who was honored at the
event, applauded the president's ``great statement ... in support
of the arts.''
   Bush said last Friday that he opposes efforts to write
anti-pornography restrictions into the law governing grants by the
National Endowment for the Arts. He said he was ``deeply offended
by some of the filth'' that has gotten federal money, but rather
than ``risk censorship,'' he trusts his NEA director, John
Frohnmayer, to make the right judgments.
   Ford's is the theater where Lincoln was shot on the night of
April 14, 1865, while attending a comedy.
   Bush, an avid theater-goer himself, recalled that Lincoln loved
the performing arts.
   ``He loved entertainment. ... and I believe he would have really
enjoyed this program _ parts of it,'' said Bush, to laughter and
applause.
   The show featured such country talent as the Gatlin Brothers,
guitarist Roy Clark and singer Tanya Tucker, crooner Tony Bennett
and jazz singer Diane Schuur. Television's Valerie Harper and John
Forsythe hosted the affair.
   Impersonator Jim Morris did impressions of both Bush and Ronald
Reagan. He had Bush asking Solidarity's Lech Walesa a Polish light
bulb joke (``He's an electrician _ he ought to know'') and a
doddering Reagan confusing the Great Wall of China with the Berlin
Wall.
   The show, entitled ``A Festival at Ford's,'' will be broadcast
by the Turner Broadcasting System on July 4.
   Ford's Theatre, which was closed after Lincoln's assassination,
was restored in 1968 as both a museum and an active theater.
   The box where Lincoln sat sits empty now, draped with flags and
a picture of George Washington against the railing, as it was that
night 125 years ago.

<HEAD>Jury Selection To Begin In Guard-Biting Trial Of AIDS-Infected

   The trial of an AIDS-infected inmate accused
of trying to spread the deadly disease by biting a guard marks a
disturbing trend in criminal justice, according to some AIDS
litigation experts.
   Jury selection was to begin today in Superior Court in the case
of Gregory Smith, 26, who faces an attempted murder charge.
   ``There's never been a case of HIV being transmitted through a
bite or saliva,'' said Larry Gostin, executive director of the
American Society of Law and Medicine, which recently completed a
nationwide AIDS litigation project for the U.S. Public Health
Service.
   As a result, ``it's not a realistic attempted murder charge,''
he said.
   Gostin and others fear Smith's case will fuel hysterical fears
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Smith is one of 10 prisoners around the country charged last
year with trying to kill or injure law enforcement officers by
infecting them with AIDS, according to Judy Greenspan, information
director for the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison
Project in Washington, D.C.
   ``Most unfortunately, this is an alarming trend in the criminal
justice system,'' said Ms. Greenspan, who tracks AIDS-related cases
for the ACLU.
   ``The whole fact that prisoners who are HIV-infected are being
treated differently in the courts is a very serious problem.''
   AIDS, an affliction that attacks the body's immune system, is
most often transmitted through sexual contact and among people who
share needles while abusing drugs. Its spread in this country began
among gay men.
   It also can be transmitted through transfusions of blood or
blood products. Medical experts say it is unlikely that the virus
can be transmitted by biting.
   Smith was indicted last summer by a county grand jury on
attempted murder charges after he allegedly bit a guard three times
on the hand on June 11. The guard was trying to put Smith into a
patrol car to transport him back to the jail after he underwent
treatment for a back injury at Cooper Medical Center.
   Smith, who was serving a five-year sentence for a robbery
conviction, allegedly yelled, ``Now die, you pig,'' prosecutors
said.
   The officer was not wearing protective gear or gloves _ although
Smith was known to have tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Smith has denied biting the guard. Shortly after the incident,
he was transferred to Trenton State Prison.
   Assistant Camden County Prosecutor Harold Kasselman, who is
handling the case, declined to be interviewed last week, citing
concern over pretrial publicity. Smith's attorney did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   Over 100 lawsuits have been filed against AIDS-infected
individuals charging them with attempting to spread the disease
through biting, spitting, throwing feces or splattering blood,
according to Gostin.
   Other cases include:
   _ An infected Minnesota inmate was convicted of assault with a
deadly weapon after biting a guard. A federal appeals court upheld
the conviction.
   _ A Centre County, Pa., inmate was convicted of assault after
throwing feces on a state prison guard. The conviction has been
appealed.
   _ An attempted suicide victim in Indiana who threw blood at
emergency personnel was convicted of three counts of attempted
murder and sentenced to 120 years imprisonment. The verdict was set
aside by the trial judge, but reinstated at the appellate level.
The case is pending before the Indiana Supreme Court.
   ``In some ways it's almost akin to sticking a pin in a voodoo
doll and hoping that someone will die,'' said Gostin, an associate
professor at Harvard's School of Public Health. Prosecution of the
inmates constitutes ``pretty much a a travesty of the legal
system,'' he said.

   The first American novel known to be
written by a black person described racism in the North just before
the Civil War, an unwelcome message that may have helped keep the
1859 book obscure, researchers said.
   ``I think it's the kind of statement that white New Hampshire
resents in 1990,'' said Barbara White, an associate professor of
women's studies at the University of New Hampshire. ``Think of what
people would have thought in 1859.''
   Harriet E. Wilson's ``Our Nig'' also depicts hypocrisy among
white abolitionists and, for the first time in American literature,
a successful interracial marriage.
   The book was published again in 1983, and more recently has
attracted attention from researchers, like White, who are trying to
find out more about the author. White plans to make her research
public sometime this summer.
   Published in Boston under a pseudonym identical to the title,
the book's lengthy subtitle doesn't mince words: ``Sketches from
the Life of a Free Black, In a Two-Story White House, North.
Showing That Slavery's Shadows Fall Even There.''
   The title itself undoubtedly ruffled feathers at the time, White
said.
   ``People who ordinarily would've been sympathetic to a black
woman writing a narrative weren't going to be sympathetic to
that,'' she said.
   Cornell University professor Henry Louis Gates has written that
Wilson ``dared to entitle her text with the most feared and hated
epithet by which the very humanity of black people had been
demeaned.''
   Gates discovered an original edition of ``Our Nig'' in a
Manhattan book store when he was a graduate student. He traced it
to Wilson with the help of several locals, including Amherst
librarian Erna Johnson and Milford town clerks Nancy Schooley and
Helen Draper.
   Milford, where Wilson lived in the 1840s, was known to have had
an active abolitionist community. Gates said ``Our Nig'' not only
would have offended whites, but also blacks who feared it would
hurt the anti-slavery movement.
   ``That such a significant novel, the very first written by a
black woman, would remain unnoticed in Boston in 1859, a veritable
center of abolitionist reform and passion, and by a growing black
press eager to celebrate all black achievement in the arts and
sciences, remains one of the troubling enigmas of Afro-American
literary history,'' Gates wrote.
   But Melvin Dixon, a professor of Afro-American literature at
Queens College in New York, said he believes the relative obscurity
of black authors in general _ not the book's views _ played a major
role in keeping the book little known.
   ``White readers were not taking seriously the writing of
Afro-American scholars,'' Dixon said.
   White said she is still establishing basic facts about Wilson,
like her birth and death dates. She also is trying to determine
whether a real family was the white family depicted in ``Our Nig.''
   ``Our Nig'' is the story of Frado, daughter of a white woman and
a black man, raised as a servant by a white family in the
fictitious community of Singleton, N.H.
   Abandoned by her impoverished mother at a young age, Frado grows
up working for the Bellmont family and suffering verbal abuse and
beatings at Mrs. Bellmont's hands.
   Wilson wrote that Frado was ``maltreated by professed
abolitionists who didn't want slaves in the South, nor niggers in
their own houses North'' and could not bear ``to lodge one; to eat
with one; to admit one through the front door; to sit next one;
awful!''
   Later, Frado all but abandons her faith, and decides that if
Mrs. Bellmont is going to heaven, she'd rather go to hell.
   Elsewhere, Frado asks the kindly James Bellmont, ``Who made me
so?'' James answers, ``God.''
   ``Who made your mother?'' Frado persists.
   ``God.''
   ``Did the same God that made her make me?''
   ``Yes.''
   ``Well then I don't like him.''
   ``Why not?''
   ``Because he made her white and me black. Why didn't he make us
both white?''

   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater is

is taking for a brain tumor, an aide said.
   Atwater, 39, was released Sunday after undergoing a radiation
treatment the day before at George Washington University Hospital,
said Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Republican National
Committee. He had been admitted on Friday complaining of
queasiness, she said.
   ``He's home and is in good spirits again,'' Ms. Goodman said
Sunday. ``He said he was feeling fine.''
   A small, non-malignant tumor was discovered earlier this month
on the right side of Atwater's brain after he collapsed during a
speech. He is taking radiation treatments five days a week to
reduce the tumor.
   Atwater was named head of the RNC after managing George Bush's
presidential campaign in 1988.

<HEAD>Jail Cells More Crowded Despite New Construction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crowding increased at local jails between 1983
and 1988 as new construction failed to keep pace with a 54 percent
jump in the number of prisoners, the Justice Department says.
   The amount of space for each inmate shrunk 6 percent from 54.3
square feet in 1983 to 50.9 square feet in 1988, despite a 43.7
percent increase in total jail space, according to a study released
Sunday by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   A census of the nation's 3,316 jails found that on June 30,
1988, there were 341,636 prisoners living in 17.4 million square
feet of space. Five years earlier, 223,272 inmates occupied 12.1
million square feet.
   The bureau's study found that 28 percent of the nation's jails
in 1988 housed more than 40 percent of their inmates in cells
smaller than the standard of 60 square feet recommended by the
American Correctional Association.
   In 1983, only 23 percent of the jails housed inmates in cells
smaller than the standard.
   The proportion of jails placing five or more people in a
``housing unit'' increased from 24 percent in 1983 to 28 percent in
1988, the study said, and the average occupancy rose from 2.4
inmates per unit to 2.5 inmates.
   In 1988, 61 percent of all jail inmates lived in the most
crowded facilities.

<HEAD>Agent Orange Study Expected This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study expected to be released this week will
help determine officially whether Vietnam veterans who were exposed
to the herbicide Agent Orange suffered cancers and other ailments
as a result.
   The study by the federal Centers for Disease Control, which the
Veterans Affairs Department says will be released Thursday,
examines the incidence of five kinds of cancer among Vietnam vets.
It is another step in a 12-year battle to gain benefits for
veterans who blame the powerful foliage killer for cancers, skin
disease and miscarriages in their spouses.
   VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski last Novemer said he would
postpone a determination on whether to award benefits until after
the study was completed. Following its release, the study must be
reviewed by a VA advisory committee of outside scientists.
   Derwinski will make a determination at the end of May after the
committee meets, VA spokesman Don Smith said last week. Final rules
should be in place in October. The decision also could influence
legislation in Congress requiring compensation to veterans.
   Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed citing Agent Orange, which
was sprayed to remove foliage and kill crops, as a cause of
disabilities. An additional 230,000 veterans have told VA they were
exposed to the herbicide, which contained highly toxic dioxin and
other suspected harmful ingredients.
   The new Selected Cancers Study by the CDC in Atlanta does not
look at whether veterans were exposed to Agent Orange.
   According to the VA, the new study will determine whether
Vietnam veterans are at higher risk of developing soft-tissue
sarcoma, lymphoma and nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer. The
study began in 1985.

<HEAD>Study Finds Six `Flags' For Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People with one or more of six
characteristics run higher than normal risks of getting the
deadliest form of skin cancer, a new study suggests.
   Because of its high curability in early stages, and the ease in
identifying likely susceptible people, ``no one should die from
melanoma,'' said researcher Darrell Rigel of New York University.
   Melanoma is expected to kill 6,300 Americans this year,
according to the American Cancer Society. Some 27,600 new cases of
melanoma, caused chiefly by excessive exposure to the sun, are
expected this year.
   Rigel described the new study Sunday at a science writers
conference sponsored by the cancer society. The work included data
from 200 people with or without melanoma, and considered 43
possible factors that might have been found to contribute to the
disease.
   Six factors appeared to raise the risk of melanoma: blond or red
hair; marked freckling of the upper back; the presence of rough red
bumps on the skin called actinic keratoses that come from sun
exposure; a history of other family members with melanoma; a
history of three or more blistering sunburns during the teen-age
years; and having spent three or more years at an outdoor summer
job as a teen-ager.
   Having any one or two of these factors gives a person a three to
four times increased chance of developing melanoma, the study
suggested. The combination of three or more factors gave an
increase of 20 to 25 times, Rigel said.
   The overall risk of getting melanoma for Americans is estimated
to be about one in 120, Rigel said.
   It was one in 250 in 1980 and is forecast to be one in 90 in the
year 2000, he said. Scientists blame much of the trend on increases
in the time people spend on the beach, and skimpier swimsuits.
   Because melanoma takes 10 to 20 years to appear after damage
from the sun, Rigel said, the behavior of people in the 1960s and
1970s has only recently begun to show up in melanoma rates.
   Lawrence Garfinkel, the cancer society's vice president for
epidemiology and statistics, said previous research gives ``good
evidence'' to support the conclusions of Rigel's study of risk
factors.
   Rigel said people at high risk of melanoma should learn the
so-called ``ABCD'' method of identifying melanoma early.
   The ``A'' refers to the asymmetry of melanoma's mole-like
growth, in which one half does not match the other. ``B'' stands
for border irregularity, because the edges of the growth are
ragged, notched or blurred.
   ``C'' refers to color, which varies within the growth. And ``D''
stands for the growth's diameter of greater than six millimeters,
about the size of a pencil eraser.
   Rigel said research suggests that if melanoma is detected while
the lesions are still thinner than about one thirty-second of an
inch, the 15-year survival rate is about 98 percent. In contrast,
if lesions are more than about one-eighth of an inch thick when the
cancer is discovered, the survival rate is about 53 percent, he
said.
   Melanoma spreads to other parts of the body more quickly than
many other cancers, he said. A melanoma growth that is the size of
a dime has probably already spread cancer cells elsewhere, he said.
   In a separate presentation, another researcher said experimental
treatments that use the body's disease-fighting immune system show
some promise against melanoma in early studies.
   One approach uses a ``theraccine,'' an abbreviation of
``therapeutic vaccine,'' so-named because it aims to fight cancer
rather than prevent disease, said Malcolm Mitchell of the
University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Workplace Schools: Youngsters Go to School Where Parent Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-year-old program under which youngsters go
to school where mom or dad works is going strong in Miami, helping
employers attract and keep working parents.
   ``I think the way society is going right now, it's almost a
necessity in very many situations,'' said Joseph Reynolds, a Pan Am
worker who each day drives his son Brian home from first grade at
the satellite learning center at Miami International Airport. His
wife, Linda, another Pan Am employee, takes Brian to school in the
morning.
   Dade County operates the satellite schools, which are built by
major employers for employees' children at the airport, a suburban
insurance company and a community college.
   Three other Florida cities have schools in place or in the
works, and inquiries have come from as far as Japan and Australia.
New York City schools Chancellor Joe Fernandez, the former
superintendent of Dade County schools, earlier this month proposed
setting up satellite schools in Manhattan office buildings.
   The Miami program, designed for kindergarten to second grade,
has gotten some rave reviews.
   The three satellite schools, with 160 children enrolled in six
classes, help the district with overcrowding, capital outlays and
transportation costs because parents are responsible for driving
their children, say school officials.
   Employers say turnover, absenteeism and tardiness are down,
while productivity and morale are up.
   ``It changes the attitudes of the workers. Their attention at
the job site changes because they don't have to worry about where
their children are,'' said Dade County School Board Chairman
William Turner.
   About the only drawback, some say, is that the mini-school
students are not exposed to the ``big school'' assemblies, big
libraries and other benefits that come with size. There is only one
class per grade at each satellite school.
   At American Bankers Insurance Group, absenteeism is 25 percent
less for employees with children in the company's day care and
satellite school, said Philip J. Sharkey, senior vice president of
human resources. Companywide turnover was 14.5 percent last year
but only 5 percent for parents with children in the programs.
Recruitment is easy.
   ``Tardiness among those employees has almost become
non-existent,'' he said. ``That all translates to better
productivity within the organization.''
   Under the program in Miami, the 280,000-student district
provides the staff and teaching materials. The employer can spend
up to $350,000 on the school building and is responsible for
maintenance and utilities.
   The next satellite schools are expected to open in September at
a suburban hospital and a downtown government office tower.
   ``Anywhere you have a skilled female work force, you've got to
have it,'' said Joe Tekerman, executive assistant to the
superintendent in Dade schools.
   He sees hospitals as a natural site, saying: ``In years to come,
that'll be a perk. They won't be able to get nurses if they don't
have child care or a satellite learning center.''
   The question of student performance is still an unknown.
Second-graders take the first formal standarized tests used for
comparison, and the inaugural second-grade class at American
Bankers will be tested this spring.
   But satellite schoolteachers boast that their parent-teacher
meetings often draw perfect attendance, compared to a teacher's
estimate of 30 percent at her previous suburban school.
   ``Academically, they will have achieved more than most
elementary school kindergartners have achieved, and I attribute
that to parental involvement,'' said Thomasine Morris, kindergarten
teacher and administrator at the airport school.
   At American Bankers, where everyone from a vice president to a
maintenance worker has a child enrolled, Sharkey sees pluses all
around.
   ``The program is outstanding,'' he said. ``There really are no
negatives. The school district likes it, the corporation likes it,
the parents like it, and most importantly the children like it. It
really has been a phenomenal success, far more than anyone
realized.''

<TEXT>
   Dr. Boshigt this month became
Mongolia's first Communist Party member to hand in his membership
card, ending a lifetime of waiting to speak out against political
repression.
   ``I had to wait for favorable conditions,'' the 49-year-old
physician said in an interview, speaking fluent English.
   He had waited for decades.
   Boshigt joined the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
even though it had purged his physician father. He worked for the
semi-official Peace and Friendship Association, acting as
Mongolia's liaison to Socialist international groups such as the
African-Asian Solidarity Committee.
   For the scholarly, soft-spoken Boshigt, as for many Mongolians,
the time to speak came last fall.
   ``With all this democratic change in East European countries and
the perestroika policy this was the time to do something,'' he
said, referring to the reform policies of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Boshigt, who uses just one name, said he met like-minded
supporters of reform in this longtime Soviet client state wedged
between China and the Soviet Union. He and the young intellectuals
organized their first rally days later, on International Human
Rights Day, Dec. 10.
   Thus was born the Mongolian Democratic Association, the nation's
first opposition group in nearly seven decades.
   ``Always (before) there were people who wanted to do
something,'' the physician said. ``It was impossible.''
   His father, Gongorjav, was jailed for several years then
banished to the countryside when he objected to replacing
Mongolia's ancient script with the Cyrillic letters used in the
Soviet Union.
   But voices of protest remained few and unorganized. Mongolia
never developed a dissident community with its own literature and
mutual support network.
   That is why the speedy and effective organization of the
Democratic Association came as such a surprise to Mongolians. By
mid-March, it claimed 70,000 members in 17 branches nationwide and
tens of thousands more supporters for its program of democratic
reforms.
   ``There is a scientific base, a logic'' to the association's
program, said Boshigt, who became one of the group's chief
strategists. ``That is why we are going on so smoothly....
   ``The only thing we accept from Marxism-Leninism is its
scientific methodology.''
   Mongolia's economic and political problems must be solved
pragmatically, he said, resorting not to ``isms'' but a careful
study of the country's past, much of which was labeled feudal and
blotted out of history books by the Communists.
   Mongolia ``had a basis for building a society. We had political,
cultural, religious traditions. Why should we cancel all that by
building socialism?''
   Determined to let young intellectuals take the lead, Boshigt
stepped out of his mentor role only twice _ when he joined younger
activists in a three-day hunger strike this month, and when he
turned in his party card.
   ``They strongly criticized me in Unen,'' the party newspaper, he
said. When the Communists staged their own rally March 11, some
carried a banner that read ``Boshigt a traitor.''
   A second intellectual of Boshigt's generation, economist P.
Nerguye, later followed suit. Many other ruling party members have
kept their cards even while joining or helping the Democratic
Association or other new opposition groups.
   But the physician said he has not been harassed by authorities.
He dismissed younger association members' dire predictions the
government may still use force to crush the opposition.
   The Communists and the government they have long controlled have
shuffled their top ranks in response to the opposition pressure,
but have yet to provide legal guarantees of political freedom.
   Boshigt said the Communists remain strong, with their control of
the media and bureaucracy _ perhaps strong enough to win hoped-for
multiparty elections this year.
   But he said: ``You cannot stop the young people, because they
really hate this Stalinist regime. There was no one I had to
convince. All were ready to give anything to end it.''

   Tom Hanks brought his kids, Dan Aykroyd wore
shorts and Paula Abdul couldn't stop giggling.
   Tonight's 62nd Annual Academy Awards were a day away, and the
pressure was mounting. Yet the final rehearsal Sunday for the Oscar
ceremony had all the gravity of a frog-jumping contest.
   With overcast skies in the forecast and overanxious fans
settling in the bleachers outside, Oscar presenters Hanks, Aykroyd,
Abdul, Tom Selleck, Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda, Jeff Bridges and
Jessica Tandy playfully practiced their corny award introductions.
   About 500 family, friends and related hangers-on settled into
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to hear the patter.
   Chevy Chase joked with a rotund Aykroyd that Chase should have
been nominated for his work in ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation.''
   And so it went. One camera operator was so bored by the
proceedings that he spent the better part of an hour scanning the
Sunday comics. Other technicians collapsed on a couch to watch NCAA
tournament basketball.
   The producer of this year's Oscar show is Gilbert Cates. He has
been asked to avenge the legacy of last year's Las Vegas-like
celebration of Oscar glitz.
   This year's show will feature muted tones and conservative
production numbers. In one of the most daring departures from
tradition, Bugs Bunny will present the Oscar for best animated
short film.
   ``I hope the outfits people wear are more spectacular than the
sets,'' said rehearsal watcher Linda Alexander.
   An estimated 1 billion viewers in 90 countries will tune into
the ABC telecast to see if ``Born on the Fourth of July'' can
triumph over its own hype and four other acclaimed films.
   The world will be watching, too, to see if ``Fourth of July''
star Tom Cruise is more popular than Daniel Day-Lewis from ``My
Left Foot.''
   All of the advertising, primping and interviewing is over. The
only drama that remains _ outside of what Cher will wear _ is whose
names are hiding in the envelopes.
   The Academy Awards are wrapped in fancy clothes, ornate parties
and elaborate production numbers. But the glitz only obscures a
common, rather artless pursuit: winning.
   In an industry where good accounting often is more important
than good acting, the Oscars now represent the ultimate marketing
tool. The motion picture studios spend combined millions on Academy
Award vote campaigns, and not because acceptance speeches are fun
to watch. Oscar trophies mean money.
   After winning last year's best picture prize, ``Rain Man'' went
on to make $36 million more in theaters. In four of the last seven
years, the best picture winner has been one of the top five
highest-grossing films of the year, according to Entertainment Data
Inc.
   Best picture nominee ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' one of the
Oscar favorites, is wilting at the box office. An Oscar would
certainly brighten its future.
   Already, Oscar nominations have given new life to two
independent films, ``My Left Foot'' and ``Henry V,'' still playing
strongly months after their debut.
   Videocassettes for ``Dead Poets Society'' and ``Field of
Dreams,'' also up for best picture, have been shipped to stores. An
Oscar triumph would give each a kick in the pants.
   Prognosticators are split over predictions for the top five
categories.
   The favorites for best picture, according to critics and
oddsmakers, are ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Driving Miss
Daisy.'' If Aykroyd wins for best supporting actor, it could be
``Driving Miss Daisy's'' night.
   If Brenda Fricker takes the early award for best supporting
actress, the ceremony may belong to ``My Left Foot.''

<HEAD>Utah Homosexuals Claim Victory as Holocaust Exhibit Opens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gay activists claimed victory after an
international exhibit about the Holocaust opened with references to
homosexual victims of Nazi persecution that some Utah education
officials had wanted removed.
   About 200 homosexuals and civil libertarians rallied outside the
exhibit Sunday, then walked to a nearby Episcopal cathedral for a
Holocaust memorial. Many wore on their lapels the pink triangle,
which the Nazis used to tag homosexuals and the gay rights movement
has appropriated as its symbol.
   ``No one is allowed to rewrite history,'' said Robert Austin,
who said he represented a loose-knit coalition of Utah gay and
human rights organizations. ``I want you to know that not one word
has been deleted. We won.''
   Utah Office of Education officials earlier this month told
Orem-based Geneva Steel Co., the corporate sponsor of ``The World
of Anne Frank: 1928-1945,'' that references to homosexual Holocaust
victims in materials given to teachers and guides might violate a
state law prohibiting promotion of homosexuality in schools.
   The company, in turn, deleted two pages dealing with the
treatment of homosexuals after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in
1933. Thousands of homosexuals were rounded up and sent to
concentration camps where they were often castrated, exterminated
or worked to death.
   A third page showed the pink triangle surrounded by the words
``Gays Against Facism,'' and a brief history of how the symbol was
adopted by the gay liberation movement in the 1970s.
   School officials worried the reference might be construed as
promulgating homosexuality and asked that it be removed.
   Protests from homosexuals, Utah's Jewish community and others
resulted in the materials being restored. School board and Geneva
officials called the incident a misunderstanding.
   The exhibit contains more than 600 photographs depicting the
life and times of the young Jewish girl whose diaries have been
read by millions since she perished in a concentration camp in 1945.
   Only a single caption refers to the persecution of homosexuals
under Nazi rule. Officials said nobody wanted that reference
removed.
   Cornelius Suijk, international director of the Anne Frank
exhibit, said he found the incident ``unfortunate,'' but understood
how it occurred.
   ``You have to remember that it took 20 years before homosexuals
in Holland were allowed to take part in the annual Holocaust
remembrance,'' he said. ``But they were victims of Hitler and
should be memorialized.''
   Suijk, who was accompanying the exhibit throughout its 38-city
tour, said Geneva officials have made every effort to maintain the
exhibit's integrity.
   The exhibit opened at noon Sunday at the City-County Building
and in the evening, homosexuals and others held a ceremony to honor
homosexual Holocaust victims outside.
   Michele A. Parish-Pixler, executive director of the Utah Chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union, congratulated Utah
homosexuals for risking their anonymity _ and in some cases their
livelihoods _ in protesting the deletions.
   ``If the fear is not allowed to grow, we won't find ourselves
being hauled off to concentration camps,'' she said. ``We cannot
let past oppressions be smothered under a blanket of silence.''
   The gathering marched to the nearby Episcopal Cathedral Church
of St. Mark for a Holocaust memorial, where Bishop Michael Coburn
asked for prayers not just for those who died in the death camps,
but for victims of discrimination worldwide.
   Geneva President Joseph A. Cannon, who was critical of the
deletions when he learned of them, said prior to the opening of the
exhibit that his company was committed to an accurate portrayal of
history, including the Nazi persecution of homosexuals.
   ``All in all it's been a good experience,'' he said. ``Basically
I'm just president of a steel company, but I've had a lot of nice
letters from the gay community.''

irresistible opportunity to gaze at the brightest newcomers as well
as the tarnished has-beens.
   Filmdom's exercise in vanity has become an unabashed rite of
spring where vulgarity often meets good taste. Will Cher wear a
tattoo-revealing outfit? Will bubbly Allan Carr show up? Reclusive
Marlon Brando? Rob Lowe? Snow White?
   While a world TV audience focuses on the horse race inside the
2,800-seat Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, thousands of back-slapping
voyeurs will gather at who's-who galas at Spago, the Mondrian
Hotel, Vertigo and Nicky Blair's.
   Movie academy president Karl Malden made it clear in recent
weeks that ``the tickets are already gone'' for the pavilion bash.
   ``There are lots of great awards night parties around town, many
of which benefit worthy charities. Please consider enjoying the
show at one of those this time around,'' Malden said in an open
letter in industry trade papers.
   Oscar winners, losers and the industry's upper strata of movers
and shakers will step outside the pavilion into a white circus tent
for the prestigious after-show Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences Governor's Ball.
   Compliments will spew and deals will be discussed, but the Oscar
winners themselves will indulge in only brief conversations for
what will become a whirlwind evening for those crowned the best by
their peers.
   Kevin Kline lingered for hours at the ball last year, but winner
Jodie Foster couldn't wait to down pizza at literary agent Irving
``Swifty'' Lazar's party at Spago. Lazar's is the ``in'' event.
   Nicky Blair's restaurant, another haute spot, plans a
comparatively subdued affair, two dinner seatings with giant TV
screens in the dining rooms.
   Former President Reagan and wife, Nancy, the royalty of
Hollywood's black-tie circuit, will not be part of the ceremony or
any big-screen TV party audience. They will watch the Academy
Awards in their Bel Air home, allowing them to watch the pre-Oscar
appetizer ``The Barbara Walters Special'' and her rare interview
with Reagan neighbor Warren Beatty.
   Fans and papparazzi by the hundreds will gather outside the
parties to hoot, holler and take snapshots of those alighting from
a fleet of limousines.
   The young and hip will gather downtown at the Vertigo nightclub,
which boasts such party guests as Oscar-nominee Oliver Stone, actor
James Woods and Frank Zappa's kids, Dweezil and Moon Unit.
   For the socially conscious, Stephen Stills, Rita Coolige and Dr.
John will perform at the Mondrian Hotel party on the Sunset Strip
benefiting El Rescate, a group that helps Central American refugees.
   Fans-a-plenty doubtlessly will ring the entrance for arrivals of
such stars as Johnny Depp, Kris Kristofferson, Roseanne Barr, Jane
Fonda, Richard Gere, Bonnie Raitt and Robin Williams.
   At the Directors Guild of America headquarters, the AIDS Hospice
Foundation party features celebrity sign-ins to raise money for
those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

<HEAD>Canterbury's Retirement Starts Succession Struggle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maneuvering to select a new leader of the world's
70 million Anglicans began today after the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Robert Runcie, announced he was resigning.
   One newspaper said today the battle for succession, which
involves the prime minister, church leaders and the monarch, was
likely to be the ``most divisive this century.'' The process was
expected to take six months or more.
   It is widely expected Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will want
to appoint someone more in step with her conservative views than
the liberal prelate, who said he would retire in January.
   Runcie made his announcement after morning service at Canterbury
Cathedral on Sunday, the 10th anniversary of his enthronement as
the 102nd archbishop since St. Augustine in 597.
   ``I am resigning now because it is 10 years and I think it is
time to leave and hand over to somebody else,'' he said.``That
takes a bit of time in the Church of England, so I judged that the
beginning of next year was the best time to go.''
   Under church rules bishops must retire by their 70th birthday,
but Runcie, who will be 70 on Oct. 2, 1991, is giving up the post
eight months early.
   The church recommends who should occupy the throne of Augustine
as spiritual head of the state Church of England and leader of all
Anglicans, including 2.5 million American Episcopalians.
   The Crown Appointments Commission _ set up by the church's
governing General Synod _ consults the Anglican Communion's 27
self-governing churches worldwide, then submits two names to the
prime minister.
   The prime minister is expected to choose the commission's first
choice but may choose either candidate or suggest her own. Queen
Elizabeth II, the head of the Church of England, will make the
formal appointment.
   In theory, any Anglican bishop can be appointed, but the Church
of England is more likely to choose an English bishop, who church
leaders feel would be more in touch with the faith's internal
workings and personalities.
   Speculation about possible successors touched on Richard Harries
of Oxford, David Sheppard of Liverpool, Michael Baughen of Chester,
John Taylor of St. Albans and Colin James of Winchester.
   Relations between the archbishop and Mrs. Thatcher's governing
Conservative Party have been strained. Runcie and many other 42
diocesan bishops have been critical of the government's
conservative economic and social policies.
   Runcie preached forgiveness at the end of the Falklands war with
Argentina in 1982, offered support to striking miners during a
yearlong strike and appealed for the Conservatives to do more for
the homeless.
   He has been credited with holding together the Anglican church
during bitter disputes over allowing women priests and church
tolerance of homosexuality.
   The Church of England refuses to admit women to the priesthood,
but other Anglican churches including the United States, Canada and
New Zealand, support women's ordination. Runcie also has said he
supports ordaining women.
   In addition, evangelicals within the church argue against the
tolerance of homosexuality shown by the Anglo-Catholic high
churchmen.
   The Times of London said today Runcie's announcement ``launched
the church into a period of intense infighting and uncertainty.''
   The paper said the battle for succession ``is likely to be the
most divisive this century and the prime minister will find herself
having to arbitrate between factions who regard the possession of
the church's leadership by their camp as vital.''
   Runcie's spokeswoman, Eve Keatley, said the prelate and his
wife, Rosalind, a concert pianist, would retire to St. Albans,
where they recently bought a home.

   For Alva Romero, who left Honduras for a better
life in the United States, an American dream ended in the deaths of
six relatives who were among 87 victims of a fire at an illegal
social club.
   Her daughter, her two brothers, a sister, a cousin and a niece
perished in the fire early Sunday morning at the Happy Land club, a
hangout for Latin Americans.
   A grieving Romero, who came to America 2{ years ago, said it
wasn't severe dissatisfaction with Honduras or the country's
political and economic upheavals that prompted her and her
relatives to leave.
   ``This is America. We all would have a chance to do better
here,'' she said as she dabbed her eyes and clutched a picture of
her daughter. ``Now, I don't know.''
   ``We came here to better ourselves,'' Romero said soon after
viewing her relatives' bodies at a morgue, ``but this is what we
get.''
   Her husband remained behind in Honduras, Romero said. Would she
stay in the United States?
   ``I don't know. Everything is changed. I don't know.''
   Romero, 34, worked as a home attendant, helping to feed and
clothe the elderly and sick.
   But now, it was friends and relatives who were helping Romero as
they gathered at a high school where officials posted snapshots of
the dead on the wall.
   Among them were Romero's brothers, aged 33 and 21; her
18-year-old sister, her daughter, also 18, a cousin, 18, and a
niece, 17.
   ``They had been to the club before and they liked it,'' Romero
said. ``It had been three weeks since they had been there.''
   ``And, last night,'' she said, her voice choking with emotion,
``They all decided to go back to the club. I don't know why.''

<HEAD>Milwaukee Plan Will to Send Low-Income Kids to Private Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson planned to sign a
first-of-its-kind bill that would let 1,000 low-income Milwaukee
students use public education funds to enroll in private schools.
   Under the plan, the state would pay up to $2,500 _ the
per-capita state education allotment _ for full tuition in
non-sectarian private schools for each student who chooses to leave
the public-school system next fall.
   The amount spent would be subtracted from the budget for the
city's public schools, which have nearly 100,000 students.
   The Legislature sent the bill to the governor on Thursday.
   At the Bush administration's invitation, the bill's sponsor,
state Rep. Annette ``Polly'' Williams, D-Milwaukee, has spent the
past few months traveling around the country to tout the plan as a
model for school choice.
   ``Money talks,'' Ms. Williams said. ``For the first time, poor
people will get respect because they can take their $2,500 to a
school of their choice and say, `I want my children educated.'''
   Thompson, a Republican, has hailed the school-choice bill and
said he plans to sign it soon.
   ``We as a state have acknowledged that private schools play an
important role and provide an effective option in the education of
our children,'' Thompson said Thursday.
   But Robert Peterkin, superintendent of Milwaukee schools and
supporter of some kinds of school choice, said the bill the
Legislature passed is ``a threat to education.''
   The bill, he said, could upset the city schools' racial
desegregation plan. He also complained it would drain resources
from inner-city schools and do nothing to improve schools that lose
students.
   ``The concept that the competitive marketplace will magically
make the public-school system improve is simplistic,'' Peterkin
said. He had no immediate plans to challenge it in court, however.
   The state's largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education
Association Council, initially also opposed the proposal. But the
union changed its position when the governor promised not to use
his partial veto power to expand the program, said Thomas Fonfara,
Thompson's education advisor.
   Fonfara said the union's decision was the key to winning
legislative support for the plan.

   The Happy Land social club might better have
been called The Disaster Waiting to Happen, according to city
officials.
   ``It was a fire trap,'' said Anthony De Vita, the Fire
Department's command chief.
   A fire that spread rapidly through the two-story brick building
early Sunday killed 87 people. A vengeful former boyfriend of the
club's ticket seller allegedly set the fire with gasoline.
   City inspectors had ordered the illegal club closed 16 months
ago.
   ``We close them today; they open them tomorrow,'' Deputy Fire
Commissioner Robert Ungar said.
   The club was riddled with safety faults, inspectors said. They
included:
   _Not enough exits. There were only two doors on the front of the
building, one of which was shuttered at the time of the fire. The
other was in flames.
   _Bars on the sole window, which was in the coat-check room.
   _A staircase so narrow that only one person could use it at a
time. It was so steep at 60 degrees that fire spokesman John
Mulligan said he was reminded of the stairs on a ship.
   _Employees who were unequipped and untrained to deal with fires.
   _No sprinkler system on the first floor.
   _A lack of proper emergency lighting or signs to show patrons
the way to safety.
   _No certification the structure was flameproof.
   The fire was apparently set at the front door, where Julio
Gonzalez, 36, allegedly sprinkled gasoline from a plastic jug. Only
three people were able to escape.
   ``To save themselves, they would have had to pass through the
fire to get to the exit,'' said Fire Department Chief of Operations
William Feehan.
   The club had no liquor or cabaret license. Its patrons paid a $5
entrance fee to enjoy alcohol, dance on a large upstairs dance
floor or a small one downstairs and mingle with a clientele that
included Hondurans and, more recently, other Hispanics.
   Many of its most loyal customers were from Trujillo, Honduras.
The disk jockey played music ranging from salsa and reggae to the
calypso popular on Honduras' Atlantic Coast. Patrons would knock on
the front door to be admitted before the door was closed and locked
again. It usually was open until 6 a.m.
   On Nov. 21, 1988, the city ordered it vacated.
   It was unclear if the club remained open or reopened later, but
on July 24, 1989, its manager was arrested by police and charged
with selling liquor illegally, said Buildings Commissioner Charles
Smith.
   It was ordered vacated again on Nov. 1 but it didn't stay that
way.
   Mayor David Dinkins said he didn't know the building's current
owner. Residents said the manager of the club was Elias Colon.
   One former patron, Arthur McIntyre, said he convinced his
girlfriend not to go to Happy Land Saturday night.
   ``It was a dangerous building from the beginning but it was a
lot of fun,'' he said. ``But a few months ago it got bad. People
started bringing guns and drugs and wearing knives. I figured
something was about to explode.''
   Denice Garcia, another area resident, called the club ``sleazy''
and said the building did not seem sturdy and the large dance floor
sometimes moved.

<HEAD>Pravda Lashes Out at Demonstrations In `Alarming, Tense' Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda lashed out
today at growing numbers of demonstrations and protests in the
Soviet Union, saying they amounted to ``legalization of extremism.''
   The newspaper said this winter was ``one of the most alarming
and tense periods in our contemporary history.''
   ``Thousands and thousands of honest people take to the streets
to say `da' to the processes of accelerating the perestroika, to
the development of democracy,'' Pravda said in a front-page
editorial.
   ``But we cannot help seeing the other side of it ... protests
and demonstrations increasingly become one of the forms of
legalizing extremism, of further undermining the situation which is
complex in itself.''
   Describing the situation as critical, the newspaper assaulted
radical reformists as well as fundamentalists, saying they are
trying to form ``organized opposition to the existing structures of
state authority'' and to seize the power by ``non-constitutional
methods.''
   Pravda was especially critical of activists and Parliament
members who were behind ``destabilizing'' rallies of Feb. 25, when
about 1 million people took to the streets in Moscow and a dozen
other cities, demanding swift democratic change.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Soviet citizens have
become much freer to express opinions in rallies, print and
politics.
   But Gorbachev has appealed to his countrymen to move past what
he has called a period of demonstrations to work hard to improve
their country.
   Pravda said that between Jan. 1 and Feb. 23, some 6.4 million
people took part in more than 1,500 rallies throughout the country.
It said almost 500 demonstrations with a total of more than a
million participants took place on Feb. 24 and Feb. 25 alone during
the rallies to press for for reform.
   Seventy-three protests with more than 1.2 million participants
occurred for three days ending March 10, the newspaper said.
   In 1989, Pravda counted more than 5,000 rallies in which 12.4
million people took part.

   The head of Poland's new government is offering
to help Soviet Jews get to Israel now that their main route has
been lost because of terrorist threats.
   Last week, Hungary's airline said it was ending charter flights
to Israel for the emigrants because of threats from Arab extremists.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland told leaders of the
American Jewish Congress on Sunday night that his country was
prepared to step in and provide assistance.
   ``Just as in the Middle Ages Poles gave refuge to Jews fleeing
persecution, Poland will not evade humanitarian assistance to Jews
emigrating from the Soviet Union,'' he said, bringing cheers from a
crowd of about 300 people.
   Mazowiecki's spokeswoman, Malgorzata Niezabitowska, said there
was no formal plan, but that if asked, Poland's LOT national
airline would be willing to provide charter flights for Soviet Jews.
   The Polish leader's offer ``is a decision of great moral and
political significance that will be welcomed by Jews all over the
world,'' said Henry Siegman, the congress' executive director.
   In Israel on Sunday, a LOT official said both the Polish flag
carrier and Israel's El Al Airlines would add a weekly flight
between Warsaw and Tel Aviv, doubling each carrier's weekly flights
on the route.
   Mazowiecki, 62, received the congress' Freedom Award for his
efforts in helping end more than four decades of Communist rule in
his country and for speaking out against anti-Semitism.
   On Friday, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Hungary's
state-run Malev airline was ``surrendering to terror'' by deciding
to stop flying Soviet Jews to Tel Aviv via Budapest because of the
threat of terrorist attacks.
   Budapest, the Romanian capital of Bucharest and several other
European cities had become transit points for Soviet Jews arriving
on the Soviet airline Aeroflot, which has deferred to Arab allies
in refusing to fly the emigres directly to Israel.
   Palestinian and Arab leaders view the immigration of Soviet Jews
to Israel as a grave threat and have launched an unprecedented
anti-immigration campaign.
   They became concerned after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
Israel suggested his country needs to keep the occupied territories
to settle Soviet Jews.
   According to official Israeli figures, about 16,700 Soviet Jews
emigrated to Israel in January and February, already higher than
the 12,900 for 1989. Israeli officials say they expect 750,000
Soviet Jews to arrive in the next decade because of the Soviet
Union's more liberal emigration policies and stricter U.S. entrance
requirements.
   Mazowiecki said in his speech that now that the Poles have cast
off totalitarian rule the time has come ``to make a breakthrough in
relations between Poles and Jews.''
   Predominantly Roman Catholic Poland was a thriving seat of
Jewish culture until the Holocaust, in which 3 million of the
country's 3.5 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Many Poles
risked their lives by sheltering Jews from the Nazis, but others
turned Jews over to the Germans. Three million other Poles also
died World War II.
   Most Polish Jews who survived left Poland immediately after the
war. Even more fled after a government-led anti-Semitic purge in
1968, leaving Poland's mostly elderly Jewish population at less
than 10,000.
   Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity newspaper editor, has offered to
reinstate citizenship for any Jews forced out in 1968, and
reiterated the offer Sunday.
   The prime minister today winds up a six-day U.S. trip that began
in Washington, where he met with President Bush, and included a
stop in Chicago. On Tuesday, he flies to Canada.

   The interior minister resigned the same
day an assassinated presidential candidate was buried, and reports
said he accused the government of no longer being interested in
fighting drug traffickers.
   President Virgilio Barco said in a communique late Sunday that
contrary to the insinuations of Interior Minister Carlos Lemos
Simmonds, the government had no intention of easing its 7-month-old
campaign against cocaine barons.
   To succeed Lemos, Barco named Sen. Horacio Serpa Uribe of his
governing Liberal Party, saying Serpa Uribe ``had demonstrated a
clear and upright position against drug trafficking.''
   The radio networks RCN and Caracol said they obtained a copy of
Lemos' resignation letter, in which he accuses the government of no
longer being committed to fighting drugs. The networks did not
elaborate.
   The government announced its U.S.-backed offensive in August,
after traffickers shot and killed the leading presidential
candidate. Since then, 14 accused traffickers have been extradited
to the United States.
   Lemos resigned amid a dispute over responsibility for the
assassination by suspected traffickers of a second candidate,
Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union.
   Jaramillo was buried Sunday in Manizales after thousands of
Patriotic Union supporters marched through the city's streets.
   The Patriotic Union's president, Diego Montana, demanded Lemos
step down, saying the interior minister made comments that probably
led traffickers to kill Jaramillo. Lemos had said the Patriotic
Union was the political arm of the country's largest guerrilla
group, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   The Colombian attorney general's office said two years ago that
many of the right-wing death squads that kill leftists have been
organized by drug traffickers. But the Patriotic Union has said
army and security forces participate in the death squads, which are
blamed for killing 1,044 members of the party in six years.
   Meanwhile, the Liberal Party held its convention in Bogota and
formally nominaed Cesar Gaviria, 43, for president.
   Gaviria, who won a March 11 primary with 51 percent of the vote,
will face Rodrigo Lloreda, the candidate for the opposition
Conservative Party, in general elections scheduled for May 27.
   The convention delegates observed a minute of silence for
Jaramillo and Luis Carlos Galan, the Liberal Party candidate
assassinated in August. Gaviria had served as Galan's campaign
manager.
   Jaramillo, 36, was fatally wounded at Bogota's airport on
Thursday. Authorities said the gunman was hired by traffickers.
   His death prompted the Conservatives and the Patriotic Union to
call for a postponement of the elections while the government takes
additional measures to protect candidates.
   But Gaviria, heavily favored to win, said the vote should be
held on schedule. ``The only antidote for violence is more
democracy,'' he said in his acceptance speech Sunday.
   The candidate repeated his pledge to fight traffickers. He said
an effective battle requires reforming the judicial system so it
can bring cocaine traffickers to justice.
   In the past, drug barons have been able to evade justice by
bribing, threatening and killing judges in Colombia.

   Wails and cries echoed from inside a school
where friends and relatives gathered to confirm their worst fears _
that one of the 87 who died in a Bronx fire was their daughter,
husband, lover.
   Many emerged pale and distraught from Public School 67 after
identifying dead family members in photos.
   A Honduran flag was draped over a fence outside the school; many
of those who died were immigrants from Honduras.
   ``They tried to live the American dream: to get a job and make
something of themselves,'' said Cheo Garcia, a former patron of the
Happy Land social club.
   ``They all dreamed of returning home _ but with more money,''
said Miguel Reyes, coach of Club Deportivo Adrana, an amateur
soccer team.
   Reyes counted team members among the dead: Orvin Garbutt, 22,
Bagoberto Echeverri, 18, and a third player, all from Puerto
Cortez, Honduras.
   They lived in East Tremont, a neighborhood populated by
Hondurans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans and Ecuadorans.
   The area is blighted by poor housing, drugs, unemployment and
truancy. Graffitti marred the rolled-down security gates on Sunday
as trash blew down streets and across vacant lots. A rat lay dead
on the sidewalk.
   Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said the neighborhood
did not have an especially high crime rate. But some young men were
snorting cocaine in full view of police officers.
   Residents are trying to renovate the impoverished area, said the
Rev. Ruben Diaz of the Christian Community Benevolent Association,
a Protestant group.
   On Saturday nights, some took a break and flocked to an illegal
social club called Happy Land.
   ``We have to try hard to close these places. They are killing
our people,'' Diaz said. ``Sometimes we say, let them have it
because they have nothing better. Now we have to say, 'What is more
important, to have a good time or to stay alive?'''
   About 1,000 people gathered outside Happy Land, next to a union
hiring hall where the victims' bodies were assembled in rows on the
floor.
   Loved ones were allowed through police lines to look at the
photos at P.S. 67.
   ``We're looking for friends and relatives and nobody's telling
us anything,'' complained Rosemary Green, who believed her
sister-in-law and cousin had gone to Happy Land.
   ``It's a slow process,'' said the Rev. A.B. Duncans, pastor of
the nearby First Glorious Church Inc., who was assisting and
counseling some of the bereaved.
   One woman collapsed on the sidewalk outside the school and had
to be helped inside, where her son's picture was displayed with
those of other victims.
   Jorge Pineda lost five friends, all from Honduras.
   A friend called Pineda's apartment at 8 p.m. Saturday, and asked
his wife if he was going, as usual, to the Saturday night dance.
   Pineda's wife hung up; she didn't approve of the place. Eight
hours later, Pineda was identifying his friends' bodies from police
photos.
   ``I'm the only friend they had,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Founded as a vacation hot spot built on
sand pumped into a mosquito-ridden mangrove swamp, Miami Beach, now
75, is growing old in style.
   Cruise ships blew their horns Sunday to kick off a year of
birthday celebrations for the city. A treasure hunt followed on
Lincoln Road, a once-glamorous avenue of shops now being
revitalized as an art center after years of neglect.
   The prize _ a diamond _ was fitting for a 75th anniversary and a
subtropical resort known for glitz. Hokey, maybe, but this town's
fame grew from tropical visions and corny promotional schemes.
   In the 1920s, Indiana auto parts magnate Carl Fisher spent
millions developing the island.
   He also hired Rosie the elephant to do the heavy lifting.
   ``There was a whole lot of smoke-and-mirrors type of publicity.
Now the beach obviously has substance to it,'' said Ruben Aguilar,
president of the non-profit corporation organizing the anniversary.
   Officially, Miami Beach was founded on March 26, 1915. On that
date, 33 of the island's 300 residents voted to incorporate a
failing coconut plantation and what was left of the swamp into the
city limits.
   Publicists then sent pictures of bathing beauties to the
nation's newspapers and the first droves of northern tourists soon
began arriving.
   In 1926, a hurricane wiped out the golf courses, polo grounds
and early hotels. It also cleared the way for hundreds of colorful
art deco hotels and apartment buildings built in the 1930s.
   Today, most of those buildings remain, distinguishing Miami
Beach from the concrete canyons along beaches in so many other
Florida cities. Their timely protection came in 1979, when
preservationists got the city's South Beach district listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.
   In the 1980s, the successful ``Miami Vice'' television show and
millions of dollars in public and private investment led to the
refurbishment or replacement of the chic hotels where Arthur
Godfrey and his band taught America to dance and Jackie Gleason
made the nation smile.
   Nowadays, Europeans often choose the city's broad white beach
over the packed French Riviera. Artists, yuppies and families now
are settling down here, driving up rents. The city's population is
98,000.
   One result of all the attention is that members of the chamber
of commerce now admit the outspoken art-deco protectors helped
rekindle outside investors' interest in the city.
   ``You've got to give the art deco and preservation people a
great deal of credit for what's happening now,'' Aguilar said. ``If
nothing else, they brought people back here. And once they got back
here, they saw what the beach was all about.''

   Sylvester Stallone and Bo Derek were named
the worst actors of the '80s and William Shatner and his ``Star
Trek V'' were the big losers of 1989 in the 10th Annual Golden
Raspberry Awards.
   ``Mommie Dearest'' was named worst film of the decade in awards
ceremonies Sunday at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.
   Razzies, as the awards are known, were bestowed for worst
achievement in film for both the past year and past 10 years.
   For 1989, Shatner was named worst actor for ``Star Drek V,'' as
the Golden Raspberry selectors prefer to call the film. The
science-fiction sequel also was conferred as the worst film of 1989
and worst director of the year for Shatner.
   Heather Locklear, who starred with Shatner in the television
series ``T.J. Hooker,'' was also honored with a Razzie as worst
actress of 1989 for her work in ``The Return of Swamp Thing.''
   Brooke Shields was singled out for worst supporting actress for
1989's ``Speed Zone,'' while Christopher Atkins got the Razzie as
worst supporting actor for last year's ``Listen to Me.''
   ``Harlem Nights'' took the award for worst screenplay of the
year, written by Eddie Murphy. The tune ``Bring Your Daughter to
the Slaughter'' from ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5'' was chosen as
the worst original song of 1989.
   In the decade competition, Stallone was named as worst actor for
his appearances in ``Rhinestone,'' ``Rambo II,'' ``Rocky IV,''
``Cobra,'' ``Over the Top,'' ``Rambo III,'' ``Lock Up'' and ``Tango
and Cash.''
   Bo Derek was recognized as worst actress of the '80s for
``Tarzan the Ape Man'' and ``Bolero.'' Pia Zadora was picked as
worst new star of the decade for ``Butterfly'' and ``The Lonely
Lady.''
   The winners were picked by the more than 275 members of the
Golden Raspberry Award Foundation. The organization includes film
makers, frequent moviegoers and movie journalists.

<TEXT>
   Monsignor William J. Toohy, a Harvard-educated
lawyer, on Tuesday will become acting director of the beleaguered
Covenant House program for homeless and runaway youth, Cardinal
John O'Connor announced.
   Toohy will hold the post while a Covenant House search committee
looks for a successor to the Rev. Bruce Ritter, the Franciscan
priest who founded the institution.
   Ritter resigned last month after some former clients accused him
of sexual impropriety, which he denied. More recent allegations
have involved possible financial irregularities.
   ``Obviously Covenant House has had a great number of legal
problems,'' O'Connor told reporters after Sunday mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral. ``So it's hardly a disadvantage for a man to
have a legal background to go in there.''
   The Covenant House board of directors approved O'Connor's
nomination of Toohy on Saturday.
   Toohy, 59, is associate executive director of Catholic Charities
and director of the Archdiocesan Office of Legal Affairs. He is a
member of the New York state bar.
   Covenant House directors also approved O'Connor's nomination of
Monsignor Timothy A. McDonnell, 52, pastor of Holy Trinity Church
in Manhattan, as Toohy's deputy.

<TEXT>
   Following the Lithuanians' lead, Communist leaders
in neighboring Estonia have voted overwhelmingly to break with the
Moscow-based national party.
   To soften the blow for Soviet authorities, however, the Estonian
party's Central Committee agreed to wait six months before voting
to finalize the split.
   Sunday's move by Estonia's ruling party follows a similar vote
in December by its sister party in its fellow Baltic republic of
Lithuania, whose Communist Party broke with Moscow in December.
   On March 11, Lithuanian declared itself independent, touching
off a war of nerves with Moscow, which called the secession illegal
and invalid.
   But shows of military strength and decrees asserting Soviet
sovereignty over the republic have not deterred the Lithuanians,
whose republic was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940
along with Estonia and the third Baltic state, Latvia.
   Most Latvians and Estonians appear determined to follow
Lithuania, though move at a slower pace, in the drive for
independence.
   Sunday's vote to establish an independent Communist Party in
Estonia was 432-3 with seven abstensions, said Lembo Taning, an
adviser on economic affairs to the party's Central Committee.
   But the official Soviet news agency Tass said 228 delegates,
including many ethnic Russians, boycotted the polling.
   Estonia's 106,000-member Communist Party has been far more
cautious than its Lithuanian sister party. It voted to wait for a
party congress scheduled for October before finalizing its split
with Moscow.
   The party also cautiously backed appeals for independence.
   At Sunday's meeting, Communist Party deputies agreed to support
``the independence of the Estonian people on the basis of the free
expression of the people's will,'' but they described the road
toward independence as ``an arduous and controversial process that
requires ... legal foundation and the establishment of a solid
economic and social basis.''
   Tass said the party would hold its October congress to ``make a
final decision on its relationship'' with Moscow.
   Russians, Poles and other ethnic groups make up 40 percent of
Estonia's 1.6 million people and strongly oppose secession. In
Lithuania, by contrast, ethnic minorities make up 20 percent of the
3.8 million people.
   In Estonia, 55 out of the 105 lawmakers elected earlier this
month to Parliament are members of the Communist Party, where there
is deeply division among supporters of independence and ethnic
Russian groups that oppose it.
   The pro-independence People's Front political movement holds 46
seats and is supported by some small parties. Russian groups have
27 seats and the Free Estonia group holds 13 seats.
   These divisions would make it difficult for the Estonian
independence movement to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority
and push through a vote on secession.
   Tass said ethnic Russian lawmakers may join with Free Estonia to
block such a vote. But Estonian activists said they expect Free
Estonia to support the independence drive.

<TEXT>
   Raymond Walter Goulding, half of the Bob
and Ray comedy team whose low-key humor and gentle satire delighted
radio and TV audiences for more than four decades, died after a
long battle with kidney failure. He was 68.
   He died at about 6 a.m. Saturday, said his son, Bryant Goulding.
   Goulding and Bob Elliott created their comedy team in Boston in
the late 1940s and performed together until about two years ago,
when Goulding became ill.
   ``I have a terrible feeling of loss,'' Elliott said Sunday. ``I
think the main reason we worked well together was that we really
appreciated each other, as opposed to some comedy teams.
   ``We had no rivalry, just great mutual respect.''
   The two brought their act to New York City in the early 1950s,
creating a stable of improbable yet totally recognizable characters.
   Among the most memorable were Wally Ballou, the bumbling
interviewer, cooking authority Mary McGoon, the Piel brothers and a
writer named O. Leo Leahy.
   They did commercials for bogus businesses as well as real ones.
Among them were ``Height Watchers International: Offering six ample
servings of low vitamins and nutrients in artificial colorings''
and ``Einbinder Flypaper: The brand you've gradually grown to trust
over the course of three generations.''
   Goulding, a native of Lowell, Mass., and Elliott made separate
starts in Boston radio around 1940, then entered military during
World War II. They met in 1946 at radio station WHDH, where Elliott
was a disc jockey and Goulding was a newscaster. Their
early-morning quips soon put them in demand as a team.
   ``We never said, `Let's be a comedy team.' But the chemistry was
there, and nobody told us to stop,'' Elliott told The New York
Times.
   They also appeared in numerous radio and television productions
and motion pictures.
   Elliott recently appeared on ``Garrison Keillor's American Radio
Company of the Air,'' the new show performed live in New York and
broadcast on public radio stations.
   Goulding's films include ``Cold Turkey'' in 1969 and ``Author!
Author!'' in 1982. He also acted in the 1970-1971 Broadway play,
``The Two and Only.''
   He co-wrote a book with Elliott, entitled ``From Approximately
Coast To Coast ... It's the Bob And Ray Show.'' It was published in
1983.
   Goulding is survived by Elizabeth, his wife of 45 years, six
children and six grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday at St. Mary's
Roman Catholic Church in Manhasset.

<HEAD>Hawke Likely To Keep Power; Crucial Outback Vote Not in</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his Labor
Party appeared likely to win a record fourth consecutive term
despite a strong challenge from their conservative opponents, media
reports said today.
   The reports said a victory could hinge on Outback voters
stranded by floodwaters who were unable to get to the polls on
Saturday.
   Hawke, who has governed for seven years, appeared to have an
edge over the conservative coalition led by Andrew Peacock in the
148-seat House of Representatives.
   Latest returns indicated Labor had won 73 seats, the coalition
70 and the Independents two. Labor, which had 85 seats in the
previous lower house, needs 75 seats for a working majority.
   Hawke said in a ``worst case scenario'' his party would win 73
votes, against 73 for the Liberal and National coalition. The
remaining two seats would go to independents.
   Peacock, 51, making his second bid for the prime ministership,
refused to concede defeat, but acknowledged Labor might have the
numbers to win a fourth term. The House of Representatives chooses
the government.
   The vote seemed to hinge on several thousand voters in the
Outback town of Kennedy who were unable to get to polling stations
because of flooding, newspapers said.
   By today, some were still prevented from casting ballots.
Representatives from both parties were sent to Kennedy to try to
influence the vote.
   Votes still were being counted in the state of Western Australia.
   Final results were not expected until Thursday, when mail-in
ballots are counted.
   Hawke on Sunday estimated his party would return with a majority
of at least one seat.
   Newspapers said Hawke, 60, seemed likely to lead his party to
victory despite dissastisfaction over high interest rates and a
$100 billion foreign debt. Economic issues were central in the
campaign.
   The Sydney Morning Herald today predicted Labor would win by at
least two seats. The daily Australian said Labor appeared to have a
slim lead.
   The Daily Mirror, in an editorial today said: ``At this stage it
looks as though Labor will be returned with a small majority,
although the possibility of a hung parliament or a Liberal party
victory still cannot be discounted.
   The paper said Australia might benefit from the close result.
   ``Both sides have effectively been given notice that their
performances must vastly improve and that they cannot distance
themselves from the concerns of the electorate,'' the editorial
said.
   Hawke came to power in 1983, was re-elected the following year
and again in 1987. He has said that if re-elected in this race, he
will seek a fifth term before retiring.

<TEXT>
   Tar balls that washed up on a
beach may be remnants of last month's 394,000-gallon spill or oil
stirred from the ocean bottom by offshore earthquakes, Coast Guard
officials said.
   The balls are about 2 to 5 inches in diameter but pose no
serious health threat to swimmers, officials said.
   ``There is a moderate amount of tar balls from the Huntington
Pier south to Huntington Street,'' about a half-mile stretch of
beach, said Lt. j.g. Donna Davis of the Coast Guard's marine safety
division.
   ``It seems to be new oil, since it has a gooey consistency,''
she said.
   Results of tests at a Coast Guard laboratory were expected in
about a week. If the tar balls were from the Feb. 7 oil spill,
British Petroleum would be asked to clean them up, officials said.
   Oil gushed from the American Trader after the tanker apparently
ran over its own anchor, puncturing the hull. The spill occurred
while the ship attempted to moor at an oil pipeline off Huntington
Beach.
   British Petroleum, which chartered the ship, took responsibility
for cleaning up 20 miles of Orange County coast. Costs have totaled
nearly $20 million so far.

<HEAD>Big Ben's Hourly Bell Stopped For 12 Weeks For Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big Ben's hourly bell, one of Britain's best-known
sounds, resounded over central London at 8 a.m. today for the last
time for up to 12 weeks to allow essential repairs.
   The famous clock over the Houses of Parliament will continue to
tell the time, but its hourly bong has been silenced.
   The hammer arm that strikes the bell to sound the number of
dongs for every hour is suffering from metal fatigue and will be
replaced, government minister Christopher Chope said last week.
   The clock's quarter-hourly chimes were also stopped for two days
while the hammer was being removed, a spokesman for the
government's Property Services Agency said. They will be stopped
again for the two days before the hourly bong resumes.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., which starts radio news
bulletins with a live broadcast of the hourly bells, said it would
substitute Big Ben with the clock known as Big Tom at St. Paul's
Cathedral.
   Big Ben, named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a government works
commissioner, first sounded in 1859. It is normally silenced only
twice a year when the hands are moved forward one hour for British
Summer Time in March _ the equivalent of daylight savings time _
and backward to revert to Greenwich Mean Time in October.
   Big Ben's longest silence was 22 days in August 1976 when a
shaft supporting the clock works shattered inside the clock room.
It last stopped for three hours in October due to a mechanical
failure.
   The name Big Ben actually applies only to the 13{-ton bell, but
it has become the nickname for the whole 20-story tower.

   Residents cleaned up today
after an Irish Republican Army bomb exploded behind a police
station, wounding eight people and damaging more than 100 homes.
   Explosives packed into four large metal drums in a hijacked van
exploded without warning Sunday at the station in Castlederg's town
center, police said.
   A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said the police
station and a nearby church were damaged. Many homes suffered minor
damage, but some were so badly damaged they will have to be
demolished, police said.
   The IRA claimed responsibility in a statement distributed to
news media in the British province, and said the bomb contained one
ton of explosives.
   Four civilians, two policemen and two soldiers were wounded.
Three civilians and one policeman remained hospitalized today, but
the police spokesman said their injuries were not serious.
   The attack was the second on a Northern Ireland police station
in less than 24 hours. Earlier Sunday, a 1,000-pound bomb badly
damaged a station and dozens of homes in Ballymena, County Antrim.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.

   Serbian police in Kosovo province
began rounding up ethnic Albanians blamed for attacks on minority
Slavs following a mysterious illness that affected hundreds of
teen-agers, a newspaper said today.
   Slavs were accused of poisoning the youths last week, but the
government has charged that the illness was faked and was ``an
action of Albanian separatists'' intended to stir more unrest in
the troubled province.
   The Yugoslav republic of Serbia, which administers the southern
province bordering Albania, took control of local police over the
weekend after the attacks that media reports said injured 30 Slavs.
   Radmilo Bogdanovic, Serbia's chief of internal affairs, in a
statement to the newspaper Politika said the largest Yugoslav
republic sent ``special units of police in all municipalities and
settlements (in Kosovo),'' and that the the province ``is now fully
secured by forces of public order and peace.''
   Bogdanovic said Serbian police were involved in identifying the
``executors of indignant attacks on Serbs and Montenegrins'' and of
the organizers of the allegedly sham poisoning.
   An undisclosed number of ethnic Albanian policemen were
suspended after allegations that they watched impassively as Serbs
were beaten by Albanians in apparent retaliation for the alleged
poisoning of Albanian children.
   Nearly 1,000 schoolchildren, most of them members of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority, were hospitalized last week, complaining
of lung and skin problems and alleging they were poisoned by a
mysterious gas.
   Federal health officials and the Belgrade-based Military Medical
Academy said no traces of poisoning could be established in more
than 100 blood and urine samples analyzed.
   More than 60 people have died in ethnic violence in the past
year in the province, where 90 percent of the population consists
of ethnic Albanians. Albanian nationalists seek to regain autonomy
lost last year when Serbia assumed direct control of Kosovo's
judiciary and schooling.

   A powerful earthquake jolted Soviet Tadzhikistan
and cracked buildings in several settlements, the official Soviet
news agency Tass said today. There were no reports of casualties.
   The earthquake occurred at 6:18 p.m. Sunday. Its epicenter was
located 235 miles southeast of the republic's capital of Dushanbe,
Tass said.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
said the quake registered 6.2 on the Richter scale of ground
motion. A reading of 6 is capable of causing severe damage in a
populated area.
   The earthquake registered eight on the Soviet 12-point scale in
the epicenter, Tass said. According to the Soviet scale, an
eight-point earthquake is termed ``destructive'' and may cause
serious damage to buildings.
   Tass said the quake registered five to six in Khorog, a city in
the southeast of Tadzhikistan, and three in Dushanbe.
   In the Pamir mountains, several buildings ``of the old type''
cracked but there were no casualties, Tass said without elaboration.

   Havel, 53, will stay in the hospital about a week, and then need
another week to convalesce, spokesman Michael Zantovsky said.
   Havel, a dissident playwright who became president after the
country's hard-line Communist rulers were ousted, suffered from
bouts of ill health while in jail for his opposition to the
Communist government from 1979 to 1983.
   He has maintained a punishing schedule since the whirlwind
peaceful revolution started in November and propelled him to the

   Since taking office, he has visited both Germanys, Poland,
Hungary, Iceland, Canada, the United States, the Soviet Union,
France and Britain, besides receiving a steady stream of foreign
visitors in Prague and making trips around Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adds Three More to Advisory Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has named three
more people to his new advisory council, a panel designed to
transfer power from the Communist Party to the government.
   The new members, announced Sunday, are Interior Minister Vadim
Bakatin, who is responsible for maintaining law and security in the
country; Valery Boldin, a department head at the Communist Party's
Central Committee; and the Academy of Sciences' Vice President Yuri
Osipiyan, a specialist in theoretical and applied physics.
   The Communist Party, which has renounced its 70-year-old
monopoly on power, has been under widespread attack for its
handling of the economy and other issues.
   Gorbachev was appointed president earlier this month and the new
Presidential Council provides him with a mechanism for bringing his
aides into the government.
   Constitutional amendments adopted when Gorbachev was elected
president March 15 provide for the council to put into effect
domestic and foreign policy and ensure security. The official
Soviet news agency Tass said the panel will also supervise
implementation of the economic policy approved by the Soviet
parliament.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev named his key advisers, Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze and Alexander Yakovlev, to the council along
with the chiefs of the military and secret police. Other nominees
announced that day included two well-known writers, an economist
and two parliamentarians.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Lawsuit in California McMartin Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit stemming from one of the nation's most publicized cases of
alleged child abuse, at the now-defunct McMartin Preschool in
Manhattan Beach, Calif.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit against a private child welfare group and one of its
therapists by two of the preschool's former teachers.
   Seven people connected to the preschool were indicted in 1984 on
child-molesting charges, but charges against five later were
dropped.
   The two remaining defendants, Raymond Buckey and his mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted of most of the charges Jan.
18 after a three-year trial.
   Jurors deadlocked on some of the charges, and prosecutors in Los
Angeles plan to retry Buckey on some of those counts.
   The appeal acted on today stems from a lawsuit by Buckey's
grandmother, Virginia McMartin, and his sister, Peggy Ann Buckey.
The women were among the defendants against whom criminal charges
were dropped.
   They said their rights were violated by the Children's Institute
International and Kathleen MacFarlane, head of that organization's
diagnostic unit.
   The institute was hired by Los Angeles County and Manhattan
Beach officials to help investigate the child-abuse allegations.
The child welfare organization concluded that numerous acts of
child abuse had occurred at the school.
   In their suit, the two former teachers alleged that Ms.
McFarlane leaked confidential information about the case to a
television news reporter with whom she was involved romantically.
The teachers also said the institute manipulated children attending
the preschool to support the abuse charges.
   A California appeals court last year threw out the suit, saying
the institute and its employees cannot be sued because California
law requires child care custodians and others to report to
authorities any known or suspected instance of child abuse.
   ``Those subject to this mandatory reporting requirement are
absolutely immune from civil or criminal liability for making such
a report,'' the state court said.
   Lawyers for the two teachers said such protection unfairly goes
beyond even that accorded prosecutors.
   ``If the prosecutor ballyhooing his prosecution before the media
is not absolutely immune for that performance, how can one say that
Kathleen MacFarlane's pillow-talk leaks of inside information ...
is entitled to absolute protection?'' they asked.
   The case is McMartin vs. Children's Institute International,
89-1257.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Giving Federal Regulators More Authority on
Electric Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
giving federal regulators more authority to lower electricity
rates, setting the stage for a decision that could affect more than
49 million homes.
   The court said it will review a ruling that barred the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission from slashing rate increases to
customers in 15 Ohio communities.
   A decision is expected sometime in 1991.
   At stake is the commission's power to prevent public utilities
from passing on to consumers allegedly inflated costs of buying
coal, and possibly other goods and services, from utility
subsidiaries.
   The Bush administration joined the Ohio communities in urging
the court to study the case.
   The dispute stems from rate hikes first proposed by Ohio Power
Co. in 1982. The utility asked the commission to approve higher
rates to cover the cost of buying coal from its subsidiary, the
Southern Ohio Coal Co.
   The commission concluded that Ohio Power from 1982 to 1986 paid
its subsidiary between 25 percent and 33 percent more for coal than
the prevailing market prices.
   The commission ordered the utility to refund $13.4 million to
its wholesale customers for that period.
   But a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here, which has authority
over such actions by federal regulators, overturned the
commission's decision last year.
   The appeals court interpreted a 1935 federal law to give the
Securities and Exchange Commission primary authority to regulate
sales contracts between holding companies and their subsidiaries.
   ``The SEC is charged by the statute with regulating the terms of
affiliate contracts in the interest of consumers, as well as
investors and the public, and has not exempted'' the contract
between Ohio Power and the Southern Ohio Coal Co., the appeals
court said.
   Justice Department lawyers said the ruling ``creates the
potential for a serious regulatory gap with respect to federal, and
by implication state, regulation of utility rates.''
   The decision ``could hinder effective regulation of utilities
that directly or indirectly serve 49 million households''
nationwide, the goverment said.
   Directly affected by the appeals court ruling are the Ohio
communities _ most of them tiny villages _ of Arcadia, Bloomdale,
Carey, Cygnet, Deshler, Greenwich, Ohio City, Plymouth, Republic,
Shiloh, Sycamore, Wharton, Bryan, St. Clairsville and Wapakoneta.
   The case is Arcadia vs. Ohio Power Co., 89-1283.

<HEAD>Court to Review Desegregation in Oklahoma City Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE> By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
ruling that, if upheld, could reinstate forced busing for the
racial desegregation of Oklahoma City, Okla., elementary schools.
   The court must decide whether the city school board acted
lawfully when in 1985 it returned to a neighborhood schools plan
for children in kindergarten through fourth grade.
   At issue is the effect of a federal judge's ruling in 1977 that
Oklahoma City's public schools had become fully integrated and no
longer had to be under court supervision.
   The issue gained national attention when the Reagan
administration helped bring about a halt to court-ordered busing of
elementary school pupils in Norfolk, Va.
   The Norfolk school district was allowed to return to a
neighborhood schools plan in 1986.
   William Bradford Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's
Civil Rights Division when it entered the Norfolk case in 1984,
said the same legal principles could apply to ``many, many other
school districts around the country.''
   Hundreds of school districts, including those in most major
cities, operate court-ordered busing plans for racial
desegregation. But only a few have persuaded courts, as did those
in Norfolk and Oklahoma City, to declare their once-segregated
systems fully integrated.
   In the Oklahoma City case, a federal appeals court last Oct. 6
disapproved the neighborhood schools plan.
   Oklahoma City public schools once were racially segregated by
law. Black parents sued in 1961 to end the lasting effects of such
segregation, and in 1972 forced busing was begun as part of a
court-ordered desegregation plan.
   U.S. District Judge Luther Bohanon ruled in 1977 that the school
district had become fully integrated, and ended court supervision.
   School officials continued the crosstown busing, however, until
1985 when children in kindergarten through fourth grade were
allowed to attend the school nearest their home.
   By 1986, 33 of the school district's 64 elementary schools were
90 percent black or white.
   Some black parents challenged the neighborhood schools plan,
calling it a tool of ``resegregation.'' Other black parents had
criticized the busing program.
   Judge Bohanon refused to reopen the case, ruling that school
officials did not intend to discriminate on the basis of race when
they adopted the neighborhood plan.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ordered Bohanon
to give the challengers a chance to prove that adopting the
neighborhood plan was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in late
1986 refused to disturb the appeals court's ruling.
   After conducting a trial, Bohanon ruled that the 1972
desegregation plan no longer had to be enforced because federal
court supervision ended with his 1977 declaration that the school
district was fully integrated.
   But the 10th Circuit court's October ruling said federal court
supervision in such cases ``extends beyond the termination of the
wrongdoing.''
   The appeals court said the Oklahoma City school board has a
continuing duty to refrain from any action that could weaken racial
balance in the public schools. It ordered Bohanon to study
``alternatives to maintain racially balanced elementary schools.''
   In the appeal acted on today, school board lawyer Ronald L. Day
said the 10th Circuit court's ruling directly conflicts with
federal appeals court rulings in the Norfolk case and one from
Austin, Texas.
   In each of those, the appeals courts ruled that court
supervision ends when a previously segregated school district is
found to be fully integrated, or ``unitary.''
   In a friend-of-the-court brief, the National School Boards
Association urged the justices to use the Oklahoma City case ``to
resolve what constitutes a unitary school system and determine the
effect of a declaration of unitary.''
   The case is Oklahoma City Board of Education vs. Dowell, 89-1080.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Extend Law to Protect Non-Citizens from Private
Bias</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to extend a
key civil rights law to protect non-citizens from private, as well
as governmental, bias.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling that
the First National Bank of Commerce in New Orleans did not
discriminate illegally against Jeetendra Bhandari when it denied
his application for a bank credit card because he is not a U.S.
citizen.
   Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor voted to hear
arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   Today's action does not set a national precedent, but merely
leaves intact a federal appeals court ruling that has become
binding law in three states _ Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 7-6 vote, ruled that
federal law does not protect aliens from such discriminatory
treatment.
   Bhandari, a native of India, is a permanent, legal resident of
this country. He worked as an accountant in New Orleans before
recently moving to Dallas.
   In 1983, he applied for a VISA Card with First National but was
denied one. He was told his application had been denied because he
is not a U.S. citizen.
   Bhandari sued the bank in 1984, invoking a Civil War era law
most often used these days to battle private bias against racial
minorities. It says that ``all persons within the jurisdiction of
the United States shall have the same right ... to the full and
equal benefits of all laws.''
   The Supreme Court previously has ruled that the law, the Civil
Rights Act of 1866, protects racial minorities from private and
governmental bias.
   The court also has ruled that the law protects aliens from
governmental bias. But the justices never have ruled specifically
on whether the law may be used to fight private, non-governmental,
discrimination against aliens.
   The 5th Circuit court, ruling in 1987, drew a distinction
between private discrimination based on race and nationality.
   ``Racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a different
kind. The former is, for the individual, immutable; the latter is
not,'' the appeals court said. ``While the alien guest is not
without his own special claims upon us, arising from our moral
tradition, they are of a different quality from those grounded in
our common humanity.''
   The justices last June 26 set aside the ruling in Bhandari's
case, and ordered the appeals court to restudy it in light of their
decision reaffirming that the 1866 law protects racial minorities
from private bias.
   After undertaking that restudy, the appeals court last Nov. 2
reached the same conclusion and reinstated its 1987 ruling.
   The case is Bhandari vs. First National Bank of Commerce,
89-1258.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Drop Treason Proceedings Against Honecker, Three
Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany today dropped plans to try
disgraced former Communist leader Erich Honecker and three other
ousted officials for high treason, saying there was no legal basis
for the charges.
   However, the chief prosecutor's office said the ailing Honecker
and two of the officials remain under investigation on suspicion of
massive corruption and abuse of power.
   Also today, efforts to form a non-Communist governing coalition
remained bogged down over allegations that leading politicians in
the week-old democracy had links to the disbanded secret police.
   Honecker, 77, and the three other top Communist officials were
members of the ruling hard-line Politburo toppled in last fall's
peaceful revolt.
   Prosecutors had said earlier that Honecker, former state
security chief Erich Mielke, former economics czar Guenther Mittag
and ex-propaganda chief Joachim Herrmann would be indicted and put
on trial this month on charges of high treason, which carries a
maximum sentence of life in prison. East Germany abolished the
death penalty last summer, before the Communists were swept from
power.
   Chief prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph said there were no legal
grounds for a treason indictment and also cleared Honecker, Mielke
and Mittag of conspiracy charges.
   Joseph, in a statement carried by the government-run news agency
ADN, accused Honecker and his lieutenants of ``persistent breaches
of the constitution.''
   But he said these were part of a Stalinist system of one-party
Communist rule and suggested that individuals could not be charged
for abuses.
   Honecker and Mielke currently are not imprisoned because of
their bad state of health, which prosecutors say is also hampering
the investigation. Honecker was arrested Jan. 29 but officials
released him a day later because he is suffering from kidney cancer.
   Joseph today ordered Herrmann released. Mittag remains in jail.
   Remaining allegations against Honecker and Mittag include
embezzlement of state funds for a privileged lifestyle, such as
construction of private vacation homes.
   Mielke, 84, faces a range of accusations stemming from his
control of the former, all-powerful state security apparatus.
   Indictments against the former officials are not expected before
May or June, Joseph told The Associated Press.
   The past also continued to haunt the new political forces in
East Germany.
   The leader of the Social Democratic party, denying allegations
he had been an informer for the Communist secret police, said today
he was temporarily leaving his post until the suspicions have been
dispelled.
   Ibrahim Boehme told a news conference he would also not assume
his seat in the 400-seat new parliament until the allegations had
been investigated.
   Boehme said Sunday talks between leading parties to form a
coaliiton government should be suspended until the allegations had
been investigated and cleared up.
   He said he was temporarily leaving the chairmanship of the party
to his deputy, Markus Meckel.
   Boehme, whose party finished a distant second in East Germany's
first free election on March 18, was the latest non-Communist
politician to come under suspicion of having collaborated with the
Stasi secret police.
   Lothar de Maiziere, the likely new premier whose Christian
Democratic Union won the election, is fighting similar allegations.
De Maiziere has strongly denied reports that he was a long-time
Stasi informer.
   The swirl of allegations is stalling efforts to form East
Germany's first democratically elected government and has
overshadowed the country's first week as a democracy.
   Boehme's deputy Meckel said anonymous allegations by former
Stasi agents were designed to destabilize the country, disturb the
population and discredit the newly elected parliament.

<HEAD>Surviving Crew Members Describe Panic As Trawler Sinks in Bering

   Matt Price was asleep in his bunk when a friend
shook him awake. It probably saved his life.
   ``He said, `Get up _ we're going over,''' Price said. The two
scrambled to the deck of the Aleutian Enterprise seconds before the
fishing trawler capsized and pitched the crew into the frigid
Bering Sea.
   Price and his friend were among 22 crewmen saved after the
fishing boat sank Thursday. Nine others are missing and presumed
drowned.
   The survivors, most from Washington state, began returning home
during the weekend. They told stories of a panicky dash to get off
the sinking ship, followed by an agonizing wait for rescue in
near-freezing water.
   Several said no alarm sounded to warn them as the 162-foot boat
heeled and began to sink in calm seas. They also said they had
little or no training in the use of survival suits that were
designed to save them.
   Price, 19, said in a telephone interview from his Aberdeen home
that he was asleep when his friend Harvey ``Dale'' Philpot, 20, of
Hoquiam woke him up. The boat started to capsize 30 seconds to a
minute later, he said.
   ``I ran up and climbed up the ladder and by that time it was
almost on its side,'' Price said.
   Clad only in pants and a shirt, Price tried to locate a survival
suit, but couldn't. ``I looked for it but I just didn't have enough
time to dig through'' all the material in a locker, he said.
   Another crew membere, Derrik Santy, said, ``I just went on
instinct. The people all around me were screaming, `Help me! Help
me!''
   Santy, interviewed by the Anchorage Daily News before leaving
Alaska on Saturday, said he was below deck when the ship began to
roll. Scrambling to the deck, Santy jumped into the water and
``grabbed anything that floated.''
   Price recalled gear tumbling across the deck. ``I was out on the
railing, then it tipped nearly all the way over and I just jumped
out as far as I could jump,'' he said.
   ``I just swam and swam and there was a round buoy and I grabbed
onto that,'' he said. He said he then swam another 50-100 yards to
a life raft where he was dragged aboard.
   The 195-ton cod fishing and processing factory trawler sank
about 250 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, the day before
it was to return to port after fishing for three weeks.
   Investigators say the boat was hauling in a netload of fish when
it suddenly heeled, rolled and went under in a matter of minutes.
   The cause of the sinking has not been determined. In addition to
the state of Alaska, the Coast Guard and National Transportation
Safety Board are investigating the accident.
   Alaska State Trooper Robert Stevenson said several survivors
told him the ship's alarm system had not worked for months. The
ships are supposed to be equipped with general alarms, some of
which sound automatically when the vessel lists too far, he said.
   Officials of the boat's operator, Seattle-based Arctic Alaska
Fisheries Corp., could not be reached by telephone Sunday. However,
Dan Roberts, company executive vice president, said Saturday he did
not know why the alarm might not have sounded.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Conglomerate in Mississippi Natural Gas
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a major conglomerate found to have fraudulently obtained a $75
million bank loan to develop natural gas fields in Mississippi.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that could
subject W.R. Grace &amp; Co. to substantial punitive damages in a
lawsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Continental Illinois National Bank made the loan to Grace in
1980 to finance the company's acquisition of three Mississippi gas
fields.
   Grace discovered before the loan was approved that one of the
fields apparently was worthless, but it did not reveal that
development to the bank for three years.
   The bank then sued the conglomerate for fraud in 1984. The bank
soon assigned the Grace loan to the FDIC since the government
agency was helping bail out the failing bank.
   A federal jury awarded the FDIC $100 million in damages,
including $25 million to compensate the agency for its losses and
$75 million to punish Grace. A federal judge reduced the $75
milllion portion of the award to $25 million.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld the
jury's finding of fraud but ordered a new trial on damages.
   The appeals court said there was sufficient evidence the company
practiced fraud to obtain the loan. ``Concealment was the essence
of Grace's fraud,'' the appeals court said. ``Only after Grace
thought it was home free _ in fact three years after it thought it
was home free _ did it reveal the fraud.''
   But the 7th Circuit court said it was troubled by the way the
jury decided the FDIC suffered $25 million in actual damages.
   ``The jury was allowed to pick a figure out of the air,'' the
appeals court said. ``The amount of punitive damages, related as
they are to compensatory damages, will have to be redetermined as
well in the new trial.''
   Grace's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to use the case to
decide whether a government agency may be awarded punitive damages
in fraud lawsuits.
   The Grace appeal also said it is unfair to limit the new trial
ordered by the appeals court to the size of damages.
   Justice Department lawyers, in asking the high court to reject
Grace's appeal, said it ``borders on brazenness'' for the
conglomerate to argue that the FDIC is not entitled to major
damages when Grace has failed to repay a $75 million loan.
   The case is W.R. Grace vs. FDIC, 89-902.

   Armenian nationalists today hurled a homemade bomb
from an ambulance and opened fire on a village in Azerbaijan, a
local news agency said. No injuries were reported.
   The attacks reported by the official Azerbaijan news agency
Azerinform followed an upsurge of violence over the weekend in
which at least nine people died. It was the worst outbreak of
violence in the region in two months.
   Extremists hurled a bomb from an ambulance as it traveled
through the village of Bala Jafarly in the Kazakhsky district
shortly after midnight today, Azerinform reported. Windows in
several houses were shattered, it said.
   Later today, Armenians opened automatic gunfire on the nearby
village of Keirumly, again causing no injuries, the news agency
said.
   Officials from Armenia's Armenpress news agency said they could
not communicate with the area and had no information about the
events there.
   Armenian nationalists shot up and set fire to buildings in three
villages near the Armenian border Saturday, killing at least seven
people, including a family of five that burned to death in their
home, official media reports said Sunday.
   Two Armenians died while trying to fire a shell at Azerbaijanis,
the reports said.
   Two bombings also were reported in the southern Transcaucasian
region of the Soviet Union, where the mainly Christian republic of
Armenia is disputing control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan. The enclave has an Armenian
majority.
   Azerinform said units of Interior Ministry troops and about 150
police officers were sent to control the violence in the villages
of Baganis Airum, Pirili and Chaily in the Kazakhsky district.
   ``These bearded men armed with machine-guns raided the villages,
and burned the houses, and took the cattle away,'' said a spokesman
at Communist Party Central Committee headquarters in Baku, the
Azerbaijani capital.
   ``The army helped us, there are about 140 troops in the area and
the situation is becoming stable. There was no retaliation from the
villagers,'' the official said Sunday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   It was the most serious outburst of ethnic violence in the
region since the Jan. 13 anti-Armenian riots and nationalist
protests in Baku and the takeover of the city by Soviet troops a
week later.
   According to official figures at least 197 people were killed in
the January violence, 125 of them after the arrival of Soviet
soldiers.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass and national TV called the
weekend reports from the Soviet Caucasus ``bitter and tragic'' and
said the attacks threatened ``some softening of the situation
recently achieved in the region.''
   Tass said firearms were used by both sides in the area Friday
and Saturday and reported shooting at vehicles and houses. It
reported some ``incidents of hostage-taking,'' without elaborating.
   But the national media singled out Armenian radicals, saying
their acts undermined the interests of the Armenian people.
   On Saturday, a time bomb destroyed a gas station in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the official media reported.
   Later, a locomotive and two wagons were blown off their rails
near the Armenian city of Megri when a bomb exploded under a
passenger train traveling from Armenia to Baku.
   Megri, in southern Armenia, borders on the Nakhichevan
autonomous district, a part of Azerbaijan that geographically is
separated from the republic by Armenia.

<HEAD>Maine Theater Founder Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Victoria Crandall, a theatrical producer who for
three decades staged Broadway musicals before summer audiences in
Maine, has died at the age of 81.
   Miss Crandall, a resident of Wiscasset, Maine, died Sunday night
at a hospital in New York. She had been in the city to cast roles
for the Maine State Music Theatre's upcoming season.
   A former concert pianist, Miss Crandall in 1959 founded the
Brunswick Summer Playhouse, which later became the Brunswick Music
Theater. The name was changed again two years ago to the Maine
State Music Theatre, with Miss Crandall serving as executive
director and artistic director.
   The theater, located on the Bowdoin College campus, rejected
packaged shows in favor of originally designed productions. Over
the past three decades, Miss Crandall staged 186 productions seen
by more than 1.5 million people.
   The theater was launched as a for-profit venture, but became a
non-profit corporation in the late 1970s in order to advance its
educational mission, said William Picher, the theater's director of
development and public relations.
   Born in Cleveland to Swedish immigrants, Miss Crandall was a
graduate of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. She went
on to become a rehearsal pianist, working with performers Ethel
Merman and Jimmy Durante and composer-lyricist teams such as Alan
Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.
   During World War II, Miss Crandall performed in Europe under the
auspices of the USO.
   As an assistant to a producer, Miss Crandall honed her skills in
putting on Broadway musicals. She made her debut as a producer in
1951 and worked with a touring company.
   ``But all the time, she was looking for a place where she could
settle down and establish a theater,'' Picher said.
   Miss Crandall is survived by two nieces. A brother died last
year.
   A private funeral service was scheduled; plans for a public
memorial were incomplete.

   An Evansville, Ind., business convicted and
fined $5,000 for showing and selling movies ``harmful to minors''
lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
conviction and fine infringe the free-speech rights of the Studio
Art Theatre's owners and violate the required separation of
government and religion.
   The business was indicted in 1986 on charges of violating the
Indiana Criminal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO) by selling and displaying movies in violation of state law.
   The underlying state law bars a business from selling or
displaying materials that are deemed harmful to minors within 500
feet of the nearest property line of any church or school.
   The Studio Art Theatre is located within 500 feet of a church.
   At a non-jury trial, lawyers for the business agreed to let four
sexually explicit movies be considered harmful for children under
18, but noted it was never alleged that any youngster actually saw
or bought those movies there.
   A state judge found the Studio Art Theatre guilty of the RICO
violations, and a state appeals court upheld the conviction in 1988
without addressing the constitutional challenge raised.
   The appeal acted on today attacked the 500-foot law, saying it
violates free-speech rights because the offending materials do not
even have to be judged obscene and therefore unworthy of
constitutional protection.
   The appeal also said the Studio Art Theatre owners' right to be
fair treatment, under equal-protection guarantees, is violated
because exceptions to the 500-foot ban are made for materials
available at certain libraries, museums and schools.
   And the appeal said the challenged law impermissibly ``delegates
to a church the ability to criminalize conduct that otherwise was
constitutionally protected simply because it locates within 500
feet.''
   Lawyers for the Studio Art Theatre said the law has the
constitutionally impermissible effect of advancing or promoting
religion.
   The justices last year used an Indiana case to rule that states
may use anti-racketeering laws to crack down on adult bookstores
and other sexually oriented businesses.
   But the court said in that decision that prosecutors may not use
state RICO laws to close down such businesses before trials are
held to determine whether any of the material displayed or sold is
obscene.
   The case acted on today is Studio Art Theatre vs. Indiana,
89-847.

<TEXT>
   Town officials reacted angrily to
news that state regulators knew _ but didn't warn anyone _ about
safety violations at a propane gas company that has been implicated
in a fatal bank explosion.
   Propane leaks are the suspected source of the blast at the
Crested Butte State Bank on March 6. Three people died and 14 were
injured in the explosion.
   Salgas Inc. of Crested Butte owns the underground propane lines
that service the town's business district.
   The Denver Post reported Saturday that state Public Utilities
Commission documents show that inspectors have found a host of
violations at Salgas' Crested Butte operation.
   The documents showed that the company had no record of required
leak surveys in the business district where the bank exploded, nor
a record of leak repairs to the pipeline, installed in 1972.
   ``I think it is inexcusable that the PUC wouldn't notify
jurisdictions of these violations by the gas company,'' said Mike
Miller, district manager for the Crested Butte Fire Protection
District. ``It's pretty tough to take action on things you don't
know about.''
   Town Manager William Crank said he learned of the report the
week of March 11. He said he requested copies from the Public
Utilities Commission and after failing to recieve it, eventually
obtained the reports from a Denver television reporter.
   Mayor Wes Light said he also was upset when he learned of
Salgas' safety record. ``I would hope they would notify
municipalities in the future,'' he said.
   Salgas executives say leaks found near the bank were not a cause
of the powerful explosion, but resulted from it.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Appeal in Nebraska Death Row Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an
appeal challenging the authority of states to house convicted
murderers on ``death rows'' and keep them apart from other inmates.
   The justices said they will review the appeal of Nebraska death
row inmate John Rust, who says such segregation is ``without
penological justification'' and ``grossly disproportionate''
punishment.
   Rust's unusual appeal, which he authored himself, does not
challenge his death sentence but only the conditions of his death
row confinement.
   The appeal, in essence, says segregating inmates who are to be
executed violates their due-process and equal-protection rights.
   Rust was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1975.
From the time of his imprisonment until 1978 he was allowed to
remain with inmates who were serving prison terms but were not
under death sentences.
   But in 1978 Nebraska chose to segregate all inmates under death
sentences on one death row at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, a
kind of ``administrative segregation.''
   Most states with death penalty laws also feature a death row
where inmates under death sentences are kept, removed from other
inmates.
   Death row inmates generally do not have all the privileges of
other prison inmates.
   Rust was convicted of killing Michael Kellogg, who had come to
the aid of police officers during a supermarket robbery in Omaha.
   Rust is the longest-serving death row inmate in a state that has
not executed anyone for three decades.
   His appeal also argued that switching the conditions of his
confinement in 1978 represented a constitutionally impermissible
``ex post facto'' punishment.
   The case is Rust vs Gunter, 89-5900.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Drops in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes dropped 2.3 percent in
February as mortgage interest rates continued to rise, a real
estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.44 million units, down from 3.52 million units in January. It was
the lowest since a 3.38 million rate in July, although it matched
last August's 3.44 million pace.
   Despite the decline, Realtors president Norman D. Flynn said the
sales pace ``shows considerable market strength and sets the tone
for a healthy sales year.''
   John A. Tuccillo, Realtors chief economist, also predicted
increased sales as rates decline in the months ahead. He said the
trade group expects existing-home sales to total 3.44 million units
this year, down just 0.1 percent from 1989.
   Flynn said many buyers selected less expensive homes as their
purchasing powers slipped when rates rose.
   Fixed-rate mortgages rose from 10.17 percent to 10.31 percent
during February, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The Realtors survey found the national median price of an
existing home to be $95,400, $900 below the median for January and
reflecting a larger volume of less-expensive home purchases.
   The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Sales declines were posted both in the Midwest and South, while
sales in the West rose. The Northeast sales rate remained unchanged.
   Sales in the Midwest dropped 1.1 percent to 930,000 units at an
annual rate while those in the South totaled 1.30 million units,
down 6.4 percent.
   In the West, sale rose 14 percent to 650,000 units and were flat
at 560,000 units in the Northeast.
   The median price for a home was $73,800 in the Midwest, $85,600
in the South, $143,000 in the West and $143,400 in the Northeast.

<HEAD>Barge Strikes Shipwreck, Leaks Oil in Texas Waterway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREEPORT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Coast Guard officials and chemical
companies were working to reopen the Intracoastal Waterway today
after a barge struck a shipwreck and leaked nearly 35,000 gallons
of light crude oil.
   ``Most of the cleanup has been completed in the Intracoastal
Canal, but there is still a lot in the adjacent waters that have
been boomed off,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Mike Debettencourt.
   He said officials had hoped to have the Intracoastal Waterway
reopened by 1 p.m. today.
   The spill occurred near environmentally sensitive wetlands and
marshes, as well as a marina and an industrial area.
   The 190-foot barge, owned by Koch Fuel Oil, was en route from
Mobile, Ala., to Corpus Christi when it struck a submerged vessel
about 6:15 p.m. Sunday.
   The barge spewed 830 barrels holding 35,000 gallons of light
crude into the waterway, Debettencourt said. Crews stopped the leak
by 10 p.m.
   ``It's not as bad as we might have feared,'' Debettencourt
added. ``It seems to be not too bad, considering.''
   Most of the damaged barge's cargo was safely stored within its
hull, and later pumped into an empty barge, he said. The barge was
carrying a light grade of crude oil called condensate, which is
extracted from natural gas wells.
   Wilsey Dupree, vice president of traffic for LeBeouf, said
Sunday night the cleanup was going well.
   ``I got all the people I can get out there going that way to
clean up,'' he said. ``I'm not looking at any complications right
now.'' He would not give details.
   Shortly after the leak was reported, Coast Guard units moved
into place to put two sets of containment booms around the barge,
called the ``MB 2.'' Absorbent pads were also used.
   Local contractors were hired to start cleaning up the spilled
oil, which was carried onto the coastline by strong incoming tides.
An Environmental Protection Agency team was dispatched to the spill
site.
   The leaking barge was about one-quarter mile west of the
Surfside Bridge in Freeport, a town of about 12,000 people 40 miles
south of Houston.
   The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway parallels the Texas coast for 432
miles from Sabine Pass to Brownsville.
   Although the Coast Guard had no immediate report on the
environmental impact of the spill, shrimpers said they were worried
that fishing in the area would be ruined.
   ``This is where I shrimp,'' said Richard Schriner. ``It's going
to be a hell of a season. Shrimping is bad enough, and now this.''
   Last June, about 168,000 gallons of oil spewed from the ruptured
tank of a barge that collided with a ship near Bayport.
   In January, about 8,600 gallons of crude oil leaked from the
supertanker Olympic Banner, about 60 miles offshore of Galveston,
causing an oil sheen 3 miles wide and five miles long.

<TEXT>
   Fustian House in Wiltshire is the dullest
stately home in England. Nothing interesting has happened there for
the last 400 years. So what is a poor tour guide to do?
   Make up an interesting history for the old place, says Lettice
Douffet, a lady as eccentric and exotic as her first and last
names. Her embellishments set in motion ``Lettice and Lovage,''
Peter Shaffer's enormously entertaining comedy about the unlikely
friendship between two very different women.
   And when the women are played by such accomplished actresses as
Maggie Smith, as the overimaginative tour guide, and Margaret
Tyzack, as her frustrated boss, it makes for a very merry evening
indeed.
   ``Lettice and Lovage,'' a big London hit, opened Sunday night at
Broadway's Ethel Barrymore Theater, where the play should run for
as long as Smith wants to do it. The comedy, directed with a sure,
steady hand by Michael Blakemore, is what used to be a called ``a
star turn,'' a chance for theatergoers to see an actor or actress
do what they do best.
   And Shaffer, author of such diverse and weightier plays as
``Equus'' and ``Amadeus,'' certainly gives Smith a lot of
opportunities. The play opens with several hilarious short scenes
as Lettice describes the history of Fustian House in increasingly
inaccurate detail to a group of gullible tourists.
   Smith, her hair a striking mop of red curls, doesn't just recite
this bogus history. She sweeps into it, arms flailing like a dying
swan. Her voice, a mixture of murmurs, coos and trills, earns
applause from her enthusiastic pupils _ and the audience.
Unfortunately, one member of the tour turns out to be Lotte Schoen,
her supervisor, who then fires the woman for falsifying history.
   For much of the play, Shaffer contrasts the two middle-aged
spinsters and their different philosophies of life. ``Enlarge,
enliven, enlighten,'' exhorts Lettice who learned the three words
from her mother, a free spirit who performed Shakespeare's plays in
French. Her own translations, Lettice proudly announces.
   Lotte is a bitter woman, unhappy about her life, but she feels
sorry for Lettice and tries to get her another job, this time as a
tour guide on a boat traveling the Thames. Gradually, their
friendship builds.
   Their love for the England, and particularly London, of
yesterday is what unites them. They lament the destruction of great
old buildings and castigate the modern monstrosities that have gone
up in their place.
   The plot falters a bit at the end of the second act, and it's
odd that one of the play's major events occurs off stage between
the second and third acts. Everyone talks about the incident,
particularly a lawyer, crisply played by the wonderful Paxton
Whitehead.
   Tyzack is a worthy foil for the extravagant Smith. Bette
Henritze scores as Lotte's dithering secretary and there is a
scene-stealing bit by a large, blinking gray cat christened by
Lettice _ with typical theatricality _ as Felina, Queen of Sorrows.
   But there's no doubt that ``Lettice and Lovage'' really belongs
to Smith, and she revels in its glorious excesses. It's a perfect
marriage of star and story.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: This is idiosyncratic theater
acting of a high and endangered order, not to be confused with the
actress' tightly minimalistic film work. If ``Lettice and Lovage''
is but a modest excuse for it, what theater lover needs any excuse
whatsoever to have a rare reunion with Maggie Smith?
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: At heart the play is a
celebration of the imagination, a celebration of the art of
theater. With these celebrants, there's great cause for rejoicing.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: This is no mere one-woman triumph.
Playwright Peter Shaffer and his director, Michael Blakemore, have
conspired with actresses, the ebulliently bewitching Smith and a
queen of more stately necromancy, Margaret Tyzack, to produce an
evening of enchantment and delight.

   The White House today called the Soviet
occupation of two buildings in Lithuania a ``significant event'' in
the escalation of tensions and reiterated a call for restraint on
both sides.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said that the
United States had received new private assurances from the Soviet
Union _ backing up public ones _ that the Kremlin would not use
force to block Lithuanian independence.
   But Fitzwater said that Moscow's action over the weekend in
seizing two Communist Party buildings in Vilnius, the capital of
the rebellious Baltic state, amounted to ``a kind of force and
we're opposed to any kind of use of force.''
   Tensions in Lithuania ``seem to have escalated on a daily basis
for the last week or so. We're hopeful that's not continuing. ...
Building occupation is a significant event in this sense.''
   ``Further actions will not lead to a lessening of the tensions
and could have adverse international repercussions and could be
counterproductive for U.S.-Soviet relations,'' Fitzwater said.
   Those comments echoed Sunday's claim by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney that a Soviet military crackdown would have ``significant
negative consequences'' on U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The president's spokesman, reading from a prepared statement,
said: ``The Soviets themselves have publicly and privately assured
us that they have no intentions of using military force to resolve
the issue.''
   Asked about recent private assurances, Fitzwater cited a meeting
at the State Department on Friday between Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger and Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin.
   Those are in addition to remarks last week between Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and ``other private discussions on a diplomatic
level,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said there is now reason to expect that the situation
in Lithuania will disrupt President Bush's summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in late June. ``We're prepared to
have the summit at this time,'' Fitzwater said. ``We're still
hopeful this can all be resolved.''
   Cheney, interviewed Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' said
that the United States would like to see the Lithuanians ``granted
the same prerogative that the East Germans were: self
determination.'' He said a military crackdown would ``undermine a
lot of the good work'' done in recent years in improving
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
said Saturday that any Soviet use of force ``would be
counterproductive'' and that the United States ``would not ignore
it.''
   Bush himself had no comment Sunday on the situation in Lithuania
as he returned from a weekend at Camp David, his mountain retreat
in Maryland.
   Soviet troops occupied two communist schools in Vilnius, capital
of the Baltic state, on Sunday, one day after tanks rolled through
the streets in the middle of the night.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Kremlin
officials have been pressuring Lithuania's newly elected leaders to
back off attempts to secede.
   Bush said Friday that any Soviet attempt to ``intimidate or
forcibly intervene against the Lithuanian people is bound to
backfire.''
   The United States and the Western world have never recognized
the Soviet Union's forcible annexation of Lithuania and its sister
Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia, in 1940 as war swept over Europe.
   But the United States now says it will not grant formal
recognition until the breakaway republic establishes control over
its territory, and Bush has urged the Lithuanians to recognize
``certain realities'' about its relationship to Moscow.
   Asked if the United States had lured Lithuania into rebelling,
Cheney said, ``We have not been out actively soliciting revolution,
if you will. On the other hand, we've made it clear that we share
the aspirations of the Lithuanian people for self-determination.''

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia will completely
dismantle its Iron Curtain border with West Germany and Austria by
June, the state news agency CTK reported today.
   Czechoslovakia had almost 420 miles of barbed wire and other
technical equipment along its western and southern borders with
West Germany and Austria before the peaceful revolution that
overturned one-party Communist rule last November.
   Border guards began dismantling the border fortifications in
December, when the new Foreign Minister, former dissident Jiri
Dienstbier, gleefully joined his Austrian and West German
counterparts in ceremonies to cut open the barbed wire.
   Czechoslovaks had received their new freedom for unlimited
travel abroad a few days before.
   Since December, about 90 miles of barbed wire has been removed
from the Austrian border, CTK said.

   Lithuanian officials met with Soviet
military officers today and said tensions had eased after their
talks about the army's occupation of three Communist Party
buildings.
   The move Sunday, which the army said was at the request of local
Communist officials, was Moscow's latest action in a war of nerves
with the Baltic republic that declared independence two weeks ago.
   ``After coming out of this meeting, I can say the mood has
changed,'' said Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas. ``It is evident
the conflict will not be escalated.''
   In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reiterated that
he has no plans to use force to bring Lithuania back into the
Soviet fold, said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who met with Gorbachev
for 1{ hours.
   ``President Gorbachev indicated to me that the position of the
Soviet Union was that there would be no use of force unless the
lives of others were threatened, and that he was committed to a
peaceful resolution,'' Kennedy told reporters.
   Kennedy said Gorbachev did not specify whose lives might be
threatened in Lithuania, or whether he thought such threats
imminent.
   Ozolas and Lithuanian Interior Minister Marijonas Misiukonis met
with Col. Viktor Smokarev, deputy chief of the Vilnius military
garrison and Col. Vladimir Trikoz of the Interior Ministry.
   They agreed not to take any steps affecting security without
first informing the other side, Ozolas told reporters.
   Ozolas said the military officers alleged that a soldier was
beaten and that shots were fired at soldiers from a passing car,
though no one was hurt in that incident.
   Ozolas said Lithuanians complained about the convoy of 100
military vehicles sent through downtown Vilnius early Saturday,
military flights over the capital and other cities, and the
occupation of the party buildings in Vilnius.
   Ozolas said while the meeting did not mean negotiations had
begun with Soviet officials about the republic's March 11
declaration of independence, ``It seems that these are leading to
talks with Moscow.''
   Earlier, Premier Kazimiera Prunskeine said the first meeting
between military officers and Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis late Sunday had begun to clear the air.
   ``We began to get relief last night with the beginning of
negotiations with representatives of the army,'' she told the
Supreme Council parliament.
   On Sunday Landsbergis spoke twice by telephone with Gen.
Valentin I. Varennikov, commander of Soviet ground forces, who in a
newspaper interview Sunday accused independence leaders of plotting
to arrest Communists and send them to prison.
   Soldiers appeared Sunday at the Higher Party School and the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Lithuanian officials said there also
were soldiers at the Vilnius Communist Party headquarters.
   Franciskas Benucius, a director of the Higher Party School, said
30 soldiers who arrived there told him they were sent to guard the
building.
   ``I asked, `What are you protecting it from?' and they didn't
know,'' he said.
   In response to the Soviet move, the Lithuanian leadership passed
a resolution calling for prosecution of troops who ``illegally''
occupied the buildings. The resolution was published today but
there was no indication the Lithuanians would attempt to arrest the
soldiers.
   The military officers told Landsbergis during the meeting that
they had moved into the buildings at the request of Lithuanian
Communists who remain loyal to Moscow. The majority of the party
split with Moscow in December to found an independent Communist
Party.
   The two opposing parties had been sharing the buildings, but
some space recently had been turned over to non-political
organizations.
   ``We expressed surprise and astonishment that the military can
occupy buildings at the request of a political organization and we
asked if such requests come from other organizations whether they
will fulfill them,'' Landsbergis told reporters Sunday.
   ``We did not receive a concrete answer,'' he said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
building seizures amounted to ``a kind of force and we're opposed
to any kind of use of force.''
   Tensions in Lithuania ``seem to have escalated on a daily basis
for the last week or so. We're hopeful that's not continuing. ...
Building occupation is a significant event in this sense.''
   For days, Gorbachev and other Moscow officials have squeezed the
defiant Baltic state with displays of military strength and demands
of fealty.
   Gorbachev ordered Lithuanians to surrender all firearms and told
them not to sign up for volunteer units under the republic's
government. State media sought to portray Lithuania as in a state
of anarchy.
   At the same time, Soviet leaders said they will not use force in
their bid to prevent Lithuanians from trying to restore the
independence they lost in 1940 when their republic was forcibly
annexed along with the two other Baltic states _ Latvia and Estonia.

<HEAD>Court to Decide If Railroads Can Ignore Union Contracts in Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether railroads can ignore union contracts to complete mergers
approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   The court said it will review a ruling that restrains the
railroads and the ICC from overriding collective bargaining
agreements.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled for the unions last
July in two separate cases.
   The first case stems from ICC approval in 1980 of acquisition by
CSX Corp. of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries.
   CXS decided in 1986 to close its freight car repair shop at
Waycross, Ga., and to transfer work done there to a Chessie System
shop in Raceland, Ky.
   The transfer meant eliminating jobs and transferring some
Waycross workers to Raceland. Transferred workers were told they no
longer could count on lifetime income guaranteed by the contract
signed by CSX and the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen.
   In the second case, Norfolk and Western Railway Co. and the
Southern Railway Co. announced in 1986 plans to merge operations
centers in Roanoke, Va., and Atlanta. The consolidation eliminated
some supervisors jobs at Roanoke.
   The American Train Dispatchers Association said the plans
violated the union's contract with Norfolk and Western.
   The ICC in both cases said the railroads were exempt from the
union contracts.
   But the appeals court here said Congress has not given the ICC
such broad power ``with so much potential to destablize the
railroad industry.''
   ``We can not impute to Congress the intention to make the
bargained-for provisions of a collective bargaining agreement
contingent upon their not later becoming inconvenient to the full
realization of operating economies that a merger might make
possible,'' the appeals court said.
   It ordered further review by the ICC in both cases.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court not to disturb
the appeals court ruling.
   The cases are Norfolk and Western vs. American Train
Dispatchers, 89-1027; CSX Transportation vs. Brotherhood of Railway
Carmen, 89-1928.

<TEXT>
   Hungarians voting in their nation's
first free elections in more than 40 years ousted the Communists
from power and may have even denied them any seats in parliament,
according to results today.
   ``If we're represented in Parliament, we will have achieved the
aim we set for ourselves,'' said party leader Gyula Thuermer, who
finished a distant fifth in his own district in Sunday's election
but still predicted Communist seats in the lawmaking body.
   With 38 percent of the vote counted, however, the Communists
were in eighth place with 3.56 percent.
   The results, however, also gave no opposition party a clear
victory.
   The conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum led with 24.59
percent and the center-left League of Free Democrats was second
with 19.92 percent, the government news agency MTI said.
   The Independent Smallholders, a revived pre-World War II party
popular in Hungary's villages, had 12.69 percent, with the
Socialists, the main successors to the Communists, trailing in
fourth place with 10.3 percent, MTI said.
   Rezsoe Nyers, the Socialist chairman, said he had no illusions
about his party's future: ``We will be an opposition party.''
   Since election law mandates runoff elections for each seat not
won by an absolute majority, it was clear most seats would have to
be contested again in a second round _ likely on April 8.
   Even a second round was not expected to determine a clear
winner, making a coalition government the most likely outcome.
   The Forum embodies traditional Hungarian populism and draws most
of its support from the provinces. The more urbane Free Democrats
have a core of former dissidents. The Independent Smallholders
advocate returning land confiscated by the Communists after their
takeover.
   The Hungarian people's rejection of heirs to long-ruling
Communists followed similar moves in other former Soviet satellites.
   East Germany held Eastern Europe's first completely free
elections in decades on March 18, and the reformed Communists were
rejected there. In June, pro-Solidarity candidates won
parliamentary seats in all but one of the races they were allowed
to contest.
   Czechoslovaks are to vote in June in their first free
parliamentary elections in decades and nationwide balloting is
expected in Bulgaria and Romania in May.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth, a Communist reformer and key engineer of
the nation's two-year reform course, was one of just five
candidates reported to have won a simple majority in Sunday's vote.
He was running as an independent.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, another key reformer, was also
leading in his race. Interim president Matyas Szueros also led in
his constituency but, like Horn, failed to secure more than 50
percent of votes to win outright.
   Another prominent reformer, Imre Pozsgay, was trailing in
another race.
   Election results trickled in at election commission headquarters
in the gothic Parliament building and at the election studio of
state television and final results were not expected until late
today at the earliest.
   About 7.8 million people were eligible to vote and election
officials said preliminary figures showed turnout was more than 70
percent.
   Under a complex distribution system devised by the Communists
and opposition in talks last year, 176 of the 394 seats in
Parliament will go to individual winners. Most of the rest will be
distributed on a proportional basis, with eight seats reserved for
national minorities.
   Hungary's last elections were in 1947, when the Communists won a
relative majority, largely through fraud. A year later, they
consolidated power and forced all other parties out of existence.
   In October, Communists reformers dissolved the old ruling party
and renamed themselves Socialists. They said they were committed to
Western-style parliamentary democracy, but most Hungarians still
associated them with the autocrats who dominated Hungarian life for
decades.

   The produce industry today bestowed on Barbara
Bush a broccoli bouquet and three cases of the vegetable and urged
the first lady to try some new recipes to entice her husband ``into
the wonderful world of fresh produce.''
   It was actually just the tip of a 10,000-pound iceberg of
broccoli that California growers are donating to soup kitchens and
shelters in a good-natured riposte to President Bush's refusal to
eat his broccoli.
   Mrs. Bush, who chairs the nationwide ``Second Harvest'' drive to
donate food to the hungry, called it ``wonderful'' and joked, `I'm
going to overlook the fact you think my cooking is not up to par.''
   ``I'm going to tell you the honest truth: the president is never
going to eat broccoli,'' Mrs. Bush told a gaggle of
broccoli-industry boosters _ all wearing broccoli boutonnieres _ on
the White House lawn before more than 200 reporters, photographers
and television camera crews.
   The industry had said beforehand it was shipping 10 tons of
broccoli from California. At the event, they halved the estimate.
   George Dunlop, president of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable
Association, boasted that 10,000 pounds of broccoli was enough to
serve 80,000 hungry people.
   ``We appreciate the fact that the president himself does not
like broccoli personally,'' said Dunlop.
   Refusing to give up the fight, he added that along with the
three cases for the White House kitchens he had brought ``along
some very good new recipes which you might use ... (and) just might
intrigue the president to take the plunge into the wonderful world
of fresh broccoli.''
   ``Millie and I thank you for the broccoli. We'll eat it,'' said
the first lady, whose pet dog stretched out on the lawn beside the
three cases of Irish Spring broccoli, spilling over a small table.
   But just as George Bush has vowed never to bite another sprig of
broccoli, she assured her guests, ``I am never going to eat pork
rinds ever.''
   She indicated Bush was adamant in his stance against broccoli.
``If his own blessed mother can't make him eat broccoli,'' she
said, ``then I give up.''
   She said that without the broccoli brouhaha, the media would
never have turned out in such numbers to cover a donation of food
to the Capitol Area Community Food Bank.
   Bush set the wheels in motion for the protest when it became
known that he ordered stewards aboard Air Force One to stop serving
him broccoli.
   He stood his ground at a news conference last Thursday, with
words a recalcitrant child could only envy: ``I do not like
broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my
mother made me eat it and I'm president of the United States and
I'm not going to eat any more broccoli.''

<HEAD>U.S. Says Burma Colluding in Drug Traffic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. official today accused Burma's
government of colluding with drug traffickers but said Washington
had no plans for military action there to stem the massive outflow
of heroin.
   The United States has identified Burma as the biggest single
producer of heroin in the world. It recently indicted opium warlord
Khun Sa, who operates in northeastern Burma, saying he was probably
the largest heroin pusher in the world.
   Washington is highly skeptical about the Burmese government's
commitment to combating the drug trade, Assistant Secretary of
State Melvin Levitsky said at a news conference in Bangkok. But
even if Rangoon was committed, he said, it would have difficulty
catching Khun Sa because it did not control the area of the country
in which he operated.
   Rangoon dropped efforts to eradicate opium growing after its
military crushed a mass movement for democracy and seized power in
September 1988, Levitsky said.
   ``Evidence indicates that the government of Burma has a
collusive relationship with some of the traffickers and is allowing
them to bargain their way to go ahead unfettered,'' he said.
   It was not clear if Levitsky was referring directly to Khun Sa,
an elusive trafficker who has operated in the so-called ``Golden
Triangle'' of Burma, Thailand and Laos since the 1960s.
   After initially emphasizing crack cocaine in its anti-drug
drive, the Bush administration is addressing the problem of heroin
which is likely to remain a longer term problem in the United
States, Levitsky said.
   But asked what Washington was prepared to do to bring Khun Sa to
trial and whether it was considering military force, Levitsky said:
``We have no plans for any kind of military action to get Khun Sa.
It would violate another country's borders.
   ``Obviously if Khun Sa falls into another government's hands or
if another government arrests him we would like to have him to try
in the United States,'' he said.
   Thailand, as well as other countries, could exert a positive
influence on Burma to toughen its stand on drugs, he said. Most
heroin from Burma is smuggled through Thailand.

   Police today fired on black
protesters in a nearby township, killing at least two people and
wounding many others, a hospital worker said.
   Police said protesters in the Sebokeng township had stoned a
police station and set fire to municipal buildings.
   Elsewhere, factional fighting over the weekend left 15 blacks
dead, according to police and press reports.
   Police used shotguns and tear gas to disperse several thousand
blacks in Sebokeng and the nearby township of Sharpeville protested
high rent and poor housing and working conditions, witnesses said.
   The townships are just south of Johannesburg, about six miles
apart.
   At least two blacks were killed and hundreds wounded in the
conflict in Sebokeng, according to a nurse at the Sebokeng Hospital
who declined to give her name. No injuries were reported in
Sharpeville.
   Police said suspected African National Congress guerrillas fired
two rocket propelled grenades Sunday night at town council offices
in the black township of Soweto outside Johannesburg. The two
Soviet-made RPG-7 grenades caused some damage, but police said
there were no injuries.
   An hour later, three limpet mines were detonated at the
Langlaagte power station in Johannesburg, badly damaging three
transformers, police said. The blasts did not cause any injuries,
they said.
   Hundreds of police and security officers were hunting today for
the men responsible for the attacks, the most serious in several
months. Police were checking areas of Soweto and questioning
possible suspects, officers said.
   Police officials, who declined to be named, said they believed
the ANC's military wing mounted the attacks as ``a show of force''
to back its demands that the South African defense forces agree to
a cease-fire.
   Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders are to meet with the
government April 11 in Cape Town to try to clear the way for talks
on ending white-minority rule and sharing political power with
blacks.
   President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and other black
opposition groups last month in a bid to clear the way for talks on
drafting a new constitution.
   Police reports said at least seven people were killed Sunday in
fighting between rival black factions in the eastern province of
Natal.
   They said four men were shot and killed when a mob burned 20
huts near Hibberdene and that three people were shot and killed in
clashes around Gesubuzo.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation said eight
people were killed and nine injured in a factional fight Sunday
near the Natal province town of Tugela Ferry.
   Fighting flared around the Natal town of Edendale when rival
groups attacked buses carrying supporters of the Zulu tribe's
Inkatha movement back from a rally. Police attempted to halt the
attacks, but 26 buses and cars were damaged by rocks and other
objects, police said.
   Police reported no deaths in the clashes.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in recent months in Natal in
fighting between Inkatha and the rival ANC-backed United Democratic
Front. Both groups oppose apartheid, but the more conservative
Inkatha wants separate states for Zulus and other ethnic groups.
   Efforts by Mandela and other black leaders in recent weeks to
end the factional killings in Natal have been ineffective.

<HEAD>Eight Try To Trade Congress for Top Title in Statehouse</HEAD>

   Eight members of Congress are trying to prove
this year that you can go home again _ as governor.
   Potomac fever rarely goes into remission, but among those
politicians who have had enough of Capitol Hill, an increasingly
popular career path leads to places like Little Rock, Tallahassee,
Hartford and Montgomery.
   Seven members of Congress won governorships from 1982 to 1989,
about a third of those who tried. Those odds are hardly comparable
to the 98 percent return rate for members of Congress who seek
re-election, but the higher risk hasn't discouraged a crop of eight
new gubernatorial aspirants this year.
   ``You can do more in an afternoon as governor than you can in a
career in Congress,'' said one gubernatorial hopeful, Republican
Rep. John Rowland of Connecticut, attributing the quip to former
Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.
   It is theme sounded often among those hoping to return home.
   Many say they want to take on greater challenges, test their
executive skills, set their own agendas and leave their marks on
education, drug abuse, budgets, the business climate and the
environment.
   ``I've spent the last seven years pushing and pulling, trying to
get the federal government to deal with its deficit. It's a very
difficult process,'' said Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison, another
Connecticut gubernatorial hopeful. ``The federal government has
lost its capacity to really be the source of solutions to many
problems.''
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who
wrote a book about the American governorship, calls Congress ``an
increasingly depressing place to work.''
   ``The budget deficit is a permanent excuse for inaction.
Democrats and many Republicans are frustrated. The money isn't
there to do what they want to do, and the will to raise taxes isn't
there,'' Sabato said.
   In contrast, he said, ``the states have both the resources and
the will to innovate. Being in a state capitol is much more
invigorating than it was 25 years ago.''
   The desire to head home to the statehouse may run even deeper in
Congress than what is apparent on the surface.
   ``For everyone that runs for governor out of Congress, there is
generally a substantial number greater than that who are thinking
about it, particularly in the off-years,'' said Rep. Joseph
Brennan, a Maine Democrat who is trying to reclaim his old job as
governor. ``Many people here, if they had a choice, would prefer to
be the chief executive of a state.''
   Members of Congress cite career advancement and personal
fulfullment as primary reasons to return to the statehouse. But
they also see the move as a chance to escape the pressures they
face in Congress from constant travel, continuous fund-raising and
little time for family.
   ``The pace and the back and forth and the commitments are a
hardship on any family, but it's even worse on a young family,''
said Rowland, who has children aged 5, 3 and 1 who live in
Connecticut.
   Roots are another element of the pull towards home. Rowland, for
instance, said his family has lived in Connecticut for 150 years.
   Democratic Rep. Ronnie Flippo, hoping to become governor of
Alabama, tells home state audiences he can't get used to ``a place
that serves their tea hot and their green beans cold.''
   Other members of Congress running for governor this year are
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of California and Reps. Bill Nelson,
D-Fla.; Tommy Robinson, R-Ark.; and Wes Watkins, D-Okla.
   At least two more members are eyeing other state jobs as
potential stepping stones.
   Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire is retiring
from the Senate and considering a run for a $100-a-year job in the
part-time state Senate while he awaits a shot at the governorship.
That won't be until his friend, Republican Gov. Judd Gregg, decides
to retire, which might not be until 1996.
   Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, considered a gubernatorial bid this
year and opted to try for lieutenant governor on a ticket with
former Cleveland mayor George Voinovich.
   DeWine, whose family moved back to Ohio last year, would take a
pay cut from $96,600 to $51,000 if the GOP ticket wins. The
tradeoff, he said, is ``a greater opportunity to get things done.''
He'll also have a statewide organization to activate when it's his
turn to run for governor or senator.

   Police Monday announced the arrests of three men
suspected of flying a helicopter over a prison and trying to free a
colleague who fell to his death.
   The suspects were arrested Saturday and Sunday around Paris
after being identified by the helicopter pilot and another witness,
police said.
   The pilot had not been told in advance of the nature of the
flight Feb. 18. His passengers dropped a line from the aircraft as
it passed over the prison in Fresnes, south of Paris.
   Emile Dieudonne, convicted of leading a series of holdups,
grabbed the line. The escape attempt went awry when another inmate
seized Dieudonne's legs in hopes of getting an unplanned ride to
freedom.
   Both prisoners fell. Dieudonne was killed and the other man
seriously injured.
   Police said the suspected mastermind of the escape attempt was
Francis Jacottin, 33, who had escaped from a different prison in
September. Also arrested were Bruno Vaird, 26, and Claude Cousseau,
45, police said.

   The government Monday denied allegations by
Amnesty International of human rights abuses in Kuwait but said it
was establishing a special panel to deal with the organization's
queries.
   At least two statements from Amnesty International over the past
six weeks have accused the Kuwaiti government of detaining without
trial a number of Shiite Moslems in connection with bombings at
Mecca last summer.
   Kuwait is a predominantly Sunni Moslem country.
   A spokesman for the special Justice Ministry panel denied the
Shiites were the victims of discrimination. He said the government
was adhering to articles in its constitution that ``provide for
equal treatment of citizens and expatriates on human rights
considerations to the exclusion of any discrimination due to sex,
origin, language or religion.''
   ``The allegations compiled in a recent press release about
illegal practices towards human rights by Kuwaiti authorities are
completely baseless,'' the spokesman added. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``Out of Kuwait's interest in the humanitarian role of Amnesty
International, the government has set up an ad hoc panel to answer
all its messages and queries,'' the spokesman said.

   A piece of French history goes up for bid April 4
with the auction of the last three available sections of the Eiffel
Tower's original spiral staircase.
   The sale is to take place in Toyko at the Hotel Okura and will
be transmitted by satellite to bidders at the Eiffel Tower.
   The staircase, which links the second and third stories of the
famed symbol of Paris, was inaugurated March 31, 1889, when Gustave
Eiffel climbed to the top and unfurled the French tricolor
emblazoned with the gold initials ``R.F.'' for the French Republic.
   At the time, the tower was the tallest structure ever built,
rising 1,000 feet from its base. The narrow, winding staircase was
the only way to the top.
   In 1983, engineers had the staircase removed for security
reasons. The other sections of the staircase were sold earlier for
prices ranging from $8,500 to 25,000.

   At least 20 rhinos are killed each yearino population g in India. Their
horns

   The Indian rhino was nearly extinct at the turn of the century
but its numbers have increased substantially, primarily because of
government projects like that in Assam.

   A journalist was ordered Monday to pay a man $6,500
for an article that concluded the man arranged his wife's murder.
The victor is currently in jail on charges he tried to arrange the
slaying.
   Kazuyoshi Miura, the plaintiff in the libel suit, is also on
trial along with a friend in connection with the eventual murder of
his wife, who was shot to death in Los Angeles in November 1981.
   Miura filed suit against magazine writer Joji Abe in October,
one year after the article appeared in the Weekly Asahi.
   The Tokyo court found that Abe's conclusion that Miura ordered
his wife, Kazumi, slain was not based on sufficient evidence.
   Miura, 42, had sought $32,000 from Abe. He also demanded that
Asahi Shimbun Co., the magazine's publisher, pay $12,900 in
compensation and publish an apology. Judge Hiromi Emi turned down
that demand.
   Miura was convicted in August 1987 of enlising a mistress' aid
in an unsuccessful bid to kill his wife and is serving a six-year
sentence. That attempt occurred three months before the fatal
shooting. Miura is appealing the sentence.
   At the same time, he is on trial along with a friend for his
wife's murder. The murder charge was filed in November 1988.

<HEAD>Some Filipinos Question Wisdom of Letting U.S. Prosecute Mrs.
Marcos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of Imelda Marcos in New
York has spared the Manila government a political dilemma, but it
also has raised questions about whether she should have been
prosecuted first on foreign soil.
   Mrs. Marcos, widow of former President Ferdinand Marcos, went on
trial last week in a Manhattan federal court on racketeering
charges in connection with the alleged looting of the Philippine
treasury during her husband's 20-year rule.
   President Corazon Aquino's administration claims Marcos, his
family and associates embezzled up to $10 billion before he was
ousted four years ago.
   Despite the allegations, neither Marcos nor his widow was ever
charged in the Philippines with a criminal offense, although they
have been named in more than 30 civil suits.
   The Philippine Constitution forbids trials in absentia, and
officials feared the Marcoses would invoke their right to return
from exile if criminal charges were filed. Marcos died in Hawaii in
September.
   The absence of criminal charges has impeded efforts to recover
the fortune Marcos allegedly transferred abroad. Authorities in
Switzerland, where much of the wealth is believed deposited,
stalled on lifting banking secrecy laws pending criminal charges.
   Officials hope that a conviction by an American court will speed
the transfer of Marcos' assets. It would also make it unlikely that
Mrs. Marcos could return to the Philippines before Mrs. Aquino's
term expires in 1992.
   When the trial began, many Filipino commentators expressed
satisfaction that Mrs. Marcos would finally have to answer in court
to allegations of profligacy and corruption.
   Even though the opening days have been devoted to the mundane
problems of jury selection, the trial has been front-page news in
the Philippines.
   ``She went on fabulous shopping sprees and gave lavish
parties,'' wrote The Manila Standard. ``Now, she faces charges
which suggest that these were made possible in large part by the
money she has embezzled.''
   Others, however, questioned the wisdom of allowing the Americans
_ the former colonial power _ to determine her guilt or innocence.
The United States had the right to do so because the alleged
offenses violated U.S. law.
   ``This means the loss of the nation's supreme legal authority to
give and enforce the law within its own territory,'' said Francisco
Tatad, a former Marcos spokesman who later broke with the late
president. ``The state lost its most important attribute and became
much less than a state.''
   Predictably, Marcos' supporters have been at the forefront of
those who feel the trial infringes on sovereignty.
   ``It is an insult to the country's sovereignty because a former
first lady deserves the dignity to defend herself in her own
country,'' said Rep. Salvador Escudero, a member of Marcos' New
Society Movement party. ``Whatever crime she has committed, it
should be defensible within the context of Philippine laws.''
   But the trial also reminded other Filipinos of the limitations
of their own judicial system, where proceedings are often
influenced by money and political power. The retrial of 40
defendants in the 1983 assassination of Mrs. Aquino's own husband,
Benigno Aquino Jr., has been dragging on since April 1987.
   ``Could it really be an affront to our national dignity, not
because an erstwhile leader is being tried by a foreign government
but because it only highlights our own failure in serving the ends
of justice,'' asked the independent daily Malaya?

   His neighbors say Julio Gonzalez was a quiet man
who sometimes helped them with their chores.
   But police said the Cuban immigrant, angered by the rejection of
a former girlfriend, set fire to the Happy Land Social Club in the
Bronx and killed 87 people.
   ``I ... right now I'm stuttering, I can't ... I'm still in
shock. To have somebody with a demented mind do that and living
here,'' said Yvonne Torres, 29, who lived two rooms away from
Gonzalez.
   The 36-year-old man moved into the rooming house about three
months ago, after he and his girlfriend stopped living together,
police said.
   Gonzalez lived in a sparse room with a bed, a clothes closet and
a picture of Jesus on one wall.
   Many of his neighbors said Gonzalez often offered to help them
carry groceries or do other chores.
   ``He's neat, tidy and well-mannered,'' said the building's
manager, Ray Davis. ``He's not loud or the type of guy you would
notice in a crowd.''
   A police spokesman, Lt. Raymond O'Donnell, said Gonzalez, who
was arrested at home 12 hours after the fire started at 3:40 a.m.
Sunday, used to work in a warehouse but had been unemployed for the
past six months.
   When questioned by police, he broke down and cried and was
remorseful, O'Donnell said.
   Early Sunday, police said, Gonzalez went to the club and argued
with his 45-year-old former girlfriend before he was kicked out by
a bouncer.
   ``He's drinking at the club. He wants to get back with her. She
says, `Leave me alone, leave me alone.' The bouncer ejects him. He
comes back and sets the place on fire,'' O'Donnell said.
   He was charged Sunday with arson and murder, O'Donnell said. He
was led out of the stationhouse Sunday night wearing a bulletproof
vest, which police asked him to wear as a precaution. Gonzalez said
nothing as reporters bombarded him with questions.
   At the boarding house, neighbor Celia Lopez, 37, described
Gonzalez as someone who did not seem to have many friends.
   ``Not many people came to visit him. He never caused any
problems or arguments,'' she said.
   Gonzalez came to the United States in 1980 as part of the Mariel
boatlift that brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States,
O'Donnell said.
   Gonzalez was detained by U.S. immigration officials at Camp
McCoy, Wis., and Fort Chaffee, Ark., until his release on Feb. 21,
1981, said Verne Jervis of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Washington.
   Jervis said Gonzalez was granted parolee status and sent to live
with a sponsor family in New York City, adding, ``We've had no
contact from him since.''
   Gonzalez never applied for permanent residency, which he could
have sought in 1982, and therefore could be deported if ever
convicted of a crime.
   U.S. officials have long accused Cuba of including hardened
criminals among those traveling on the boatlift, but Jervis said
Gonzalez's only criminal record in Cuba was serving ``some time''
in prison for desertion from the Cuban army.
   Luis Rolan, 30, lived next door to Gonzalez's 10-foot by 12-foot
room, which has a small balcony and rented for less than $100 a
week.
   The two would drink beer together, but Gonzalez never mentioned
problems with his girlfriend. ``That was just too personal. We
didn't get into things like that,'' he said.
   ``He's a nice guy. He didn't talk to nobody. He wasn't the kind
who would do this,'' Rolan said.
   ``But you know what they say,'' Davis said. ``It's the quiet guy
you have to watch for.''

   In his writings, Knorr argued against use of military force
during the nuclear age.
   During the buildup of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam in
1968, Knorr called for the withdrawal of American and North
Vietnamese forces, introduction of an international peacekeeping
force and the formation of a neutral government in South Vietnam.
The war continued for seven more years.
   Knorr earned his law degree in Germany and left for the United
States in 1937 after resisting pressure to join the Nazi party.
   He earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1941 and
taught economics at Stanford, Yale and Princeton, where he remained
for 28 years. He directed Princeton's Center of International
Studies from 1960 to 1968.
   His works included ``On the Uses of Military Power in the
Nuclear Age,'' ``Military Power and Potential'' and ``Power and
Wealth: The Political Economy of International Power.''
   Survivors include his wife, Marianne; daughters, Monica of
Washington and Jean of Alexandria, Va.; and son Nicholas of
Glencoe, Ill.

   FBI agents arrested two top members of New
England's organized crime families this morning as part of a
three-state dragnet targeting 21 suspected mobsters on a total of
113 criminal counts.
   Paul Cavanaugh, a spokesman for the FBI's field office in
Boston, said alleged mob figures in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Connecticut were being arrested on unsealed indictments alleging a
variety of crimes, including murder, racketeering, kidnapping, drug
trafficking, gambling, obstruction of justice and witness
intimidation.
   At least six people were already under arrest this morning after
agents began zeroing in on alleged mobsters about 6 a.m., Cavanaugh
said.
   ``Dozens of agents are out making arrests all over the
three-state area,'' he said. ``It's one of the biggest strikes
against organized crime in law enforcement history.''
   Raymond Patriarca Jr., reputed boss of the Patriarca crime
family that formerly was headed by his late father, was arrested at
about 6:30 a.m. today at his home in Lincoln, R.I.
   Patriarca appeared this morning before a U.S. magistrate in
Providence, who ordered him transferred to Boston for arraignment
on Tuesday at the earliest.
   Attorney John F. Cicilline had argued his 45-year-old client
should be given three days to determine whether he was medically
fit to make the 50-mile trip to Massachusetts. Cicilline said his
client suffers from cancer and cataracts.
   Alleged underboss Nicholas Bianco was also arrested, along with
a lower-level figure, alleged Mafia captain Matthew Gugliemetti,
according to Lincoln Almond, the U.S. attorney in Providence. The
names of the other three people arrested by late morning were not
immediately released.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was en route to Boston, where
he and FBI Director William Sessions were scheduled to detail the
indictments at an afternoon news conference.
   ``This is definitely a megacase,'' Cavanaugh said. ``It's a real
blow to the leadership and activities of all the alleged criminal
organizations.''
   Almond said the unsealed indictments cover four of five alleged
captains of the Patriarca crime family and the legal adviser.
   ``It involves the whole hierarchy of the family,'' he said.
``We've broken the family.''
   Patriarca Sr., who died in 1984, was identified as head of the
New England Cosa Nostra during 1969 Senate committee hearings. An
eighth-grade dropout, he shined shoes and worked as a bellhop in
the Biltmore Plaza Hotel in Providence before allegedly working his
way into small-time rum running and armed robbery.
   The alleged mob kingpin was arrested more than 40 times and
convicted of 18 crimes, ranging from playing dice on Sunday to
armed robbery and conspiracy to murder. He served seven years in
prison.
   The ailing Patriarca was indicted in September 1981 on charges
of taking part in a scheme to skim $11 million from the Laborers'
International Union, but a federal magistrate found him too ill to
stand trial on the racketeering charges in Florida.
   Law enforcement officials generally believe that Patriarca's son
inherited control of the New England mob on his father's death.

<HEAD>Barco Government's Drug War Position Comes Under Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco came under
attack Monday after his top Cabinet minister resigned and suggested
the government's resolve has weakened against drug traffickers.
   Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds stepped down Sunday
night. His replacement, former Attorney General Horacio Serpa, said
the government's position against drug traffickers has not changed
since Barco launched his crackdown against them Aug. 18.
   However, Lemos, who was in charge of internal security and led
the fight against traffickers, disagreed. He said he tried to block
special deals sought by the traffickers but that the Liberal Party
government was less firm in its resolve to fight the cartels.
   On Monday, the presidential candidate of the opposition
Conservative Party, Rodrigo Lloreda, accused the Barco government
of being ambiguous and insincere in its stated effort to fight the
traffickers.
   In his resignation letter, Lemos said that in the last three
months ``there has been an almost imperceptible change in some
parts of the government as to the position on drug trafficking, and
now it is not as decisive, instransigent and firm.''
   Referring to the traffickers, Lemos wrote that he fought to
block ``special deals and arrangements through which they look for
less rigorous and more flexible treatment for their crimes.'' He
did not elaborate.
   The president's press office sent copies of the resignation
letter to the news media after radio stations obtained copies and
broadcast portions of it.
   Lemos did not mention it specifically, but the government has
not extradited any trafficking suspects since Jan. 21. Between Aug.
18 and Jan. 21, 14 suspects were extradited to the United States.
   There are currently 17 people in Colombian custody who are
wanted on drug-related charges in the United States.
   Barco has not explained why the extraditions ended. They ground
to a halt just three days after the Medellin drug cartel appealed
for a negotiated settlement in the crackdown and asked for an end
to extraditions.
   Lemos' resignation apparently was demanded by Barco after a
leftist party alleged that a statement Lemos made led to the
assassination of the party's presidential candidate.
   Lemos said two weeks ago that the leftist Patriotic Union Party
was the political arm of the country's biggest leftist guerrilla
group, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   The Patriotic Union's candidate for the May 26 presidential
elections, Bernardo Jaramillo, was assassinated Thursday in Bogota.
   The party said Lemos' statement had drawn the attention of
right-wing death squads. The death squads have killed 1,044 members
of the Patriotic Union since the party was organized in 1984.
   Gen. Miguel Maza of Colombia's secret police said the killer,
who was wounded and captured, had been hired by drug traffickers.
   The government said two years ago that many of the dozens of
right-wing death squads in Colombia had been organized by drug
traffickers.
   The new interior minister, Serpa, was an attorney general under
Barco for one year. Serpa resigned last year to run for the Senate.
He will surrender the Senate seat he won in elections two weeks ago.

<HEAD>Poindexter Told Reagan U.S. Not Involved in Contra Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Poindexter told President Reagan the U.S.
government had no connection to a Contra resupply plane that
crashed in Nicaragua, a former National Security Council employee
testified today at Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial.
   Poindexter made the statement to Reagan on Oct. 7, 1986, two
days after the plane carrying ammunition was shot down and one of
its crewmen, Eugene Hasenfus, was captured, Rodney McDaniel
testified.
   Actually, the Hasenfus flight was part of the network overseen
by Oliver North to keep the Contras armed during a congressional
ban on U.S. military aid to the rebel force.
   Poindexter told Congress in 1987 that ``obviously'' there was
knowledge and coordination by the NSC staff of North's network that
handled the Hasenfus flight.
   Appearing as a defense witness, McDaniel, then the NSC's
executive secretary, took notes during Poindexter's briefing of the
president.
   ``The president had either watched TV or read the newspapers and
started'' out by asking ```what is this all about?''' testified
McDaniel.
   ``Admiral Poindexter reported that he didn't have all the facts,
but he understood it was not a U.S. government operation,'' said
McDaniel.
   Poindexter told Reagan the flight was ``not connected to the
U.S. government'' and that Poindexter ``does not know who Hasenfus
is involved with,'' said Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb. Webb was
referring to McDaniel's notes.
   Did Poindexter ever tell the president that Hasenfus was
connected to North's Contra resupply network? asked Webb.
   ``Not in my presence,'' said McDaniel.
   The day after being briefed by Poindexter, Reagan replied
``absolutely none'' when asked by reporters whether the Hasenfus
plane had any link to the U.S. government.
   Poindexter is charged with five felony counts of obstructing
Congress, conspiracy and making false statements to congressional
committees in the Iran-Contra affair.
   On another matter, McDaniel testified that it was not unusual to
delete computer messages.
   More than 5,000 messages in Poindexter's computer file were
killed out in the days before he resigned, according to previous
testimony. The former national security adviser is accused of
deleting them to cover up from Congress the U.S. role in a 1985
Hawk missile shipment to Iran.
   Under cross-examination, McDaniel acknowledged it was unusual to
delete an entire computer file.
   McDaniel also said that North tended to exaggerate his own role
in events.
   North testified he saw Poindexter tear up a presidential
document that depicted the U.S. government as being involved in an
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran. North also testified that
Poindexter send his aide to a meeting with congressmen, where North
lied by denying he was assisting the Contras militarily.

   A group including the parents of a
Pan Am bombing victim sued the airline today, contending it
collected a $5-per-ticket surcharge for security on international
flights but never spent the money to protect passengers.
   Among those filing suit against Pan American World Airways were
Peter and Aphrodite Tsairis, parents of Alexia Tsairis, who died
when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, Dec. 21,
1988.
   Richard A. Grossman, an attorney handling the case, said the
lawsuit was intended to be a class action for customers who
purchased Pan Am tickets from 1986 until 1989.
   ``Damages could amount to over $100 million, with more than a
million passengers in line for refunds plus punitive damages,'' he
said. ``The truth is that these passengers paid for something they
did not get. That something was effective security.''
   The crash of the Boeing 747 killed 259 passengers and crew, and
11 people on the ground.
   Besides the Tsairises of Franklin Lakes, also part of filing
suit was T. Jennifer Vail of Wilmington, Del., and Miss Tsairis'
estate. Named as defendants were Pan Am Corp.; Pan American World
Airways Inc.; Pan American World Services Inc.; Alert Management
Systems Inc.; C. Edward Acker, a former president and chief
executive officer of the corporation; and Martin E. Shugrue Jr., a
former vice chairman of the corporation and chief executive officer
of Pan Am World Airways, Grossman said.
   Ms. Vail is a customer of Pan Am seeking reimbursement of the
surcharges.
   ``She's a representative of the group, in effect,'' said
Grossman.
   Elizabeth Manners, a Pan Am spokeswoman, said the company has
not seen the lawsuit and would have no immediate comment.
Generally, however, she said Pan Am takes the position that its
flight security is sufficient.
   ``American carriers do have quite stringent requirements and we
cetainly do abide by them,'' she said.
   Grossman said other targets of the suit were former board
members and officers of the corporation. There names were not
available before the suit was filed, he said.
   Grossman said Pan Am has acknowledged collecting $18 million in
surcharges.
   He said the airline's own security expert, Isaac Yeffet, told
Pan Am officials almost two years before the Flight 103 crash that
the carrier's security was ``almost totally ineffectual'' and that
leveling a surcharge ``could be regarded as fraud.''
   The lawsuit said Pan Am ignored Yeffet's call for sweeping
changes in the airline's security system, yet continued to impose
the $5 surcharge. Yeffet was previously head of security at El Al
Airlines in Israel, the lawyer said.

<HEAD>Romanians Claim Oina Inspired Baseball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB GLOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fans across America might eagerly be
awaiting the start of the oina season if an American here had not
changed a few rules and renamed it baseball, according to a
Romanian sports official.
   Adding his voice to the decades-old debate over the origin of
baseball, Cristian Costescu said the American pastime derived from
the ancient game of oina, which was introduced to the United States
by a pair of Transylvanians.
   Costescu, president of the new Romanian Baseball Federation,
says the two immigrants from the Romanian village of Alba Iulia
joined the U.S. Army and taught the game to their comrades.
   Among their comrades was a young officer named Abner Doubleday,
who changed a few rules and created baseball in 1839, Cotescu said
in an interview.
   ``We are not saying that Romania invented baseball. We would not
like someone else to tell us oina was invented by others,'' said
Costescu. ``But we are saying this: some little inspiration for
baseball was from oina. Baseball is more sophisticated than oina,
but the structure is the same.''
   Romanians claim oina was invented by shepherds in the first
century and say documents from 1310 describe a variation of the
game called hoina being played in southern Romania.
   Oina has 11 men per side, with one team batting and the other in
the field. Each side is allowed one at-bat, in which all 11 players
take the plate.
   A pitcher is provided by the team at bat and he serves up a lazy
underhand toss. The batter tries to hit the ball as far as
possible, then has to run 120 yards through nine bases.
   But if the batter is tagged by a fielder or hit by a thrown
ball, the fielders can score points _ so teams can score even while
not at bat.
   Oina uses a ball almost the same size as a baseball but filled
with horse hair. The bat is similar to a cricket bat and fielders
do not wear gloves.
   Oina still is a Romanian national sport, with forms of the game
being played in various regions of the Balkan country. Though there
are 1,675 teams around Romania, as opposed to about 15 baseball
teams in the country, its popularity has slumped in recent years.
   ``Fifty years ago everybody was playing oina, all the high
schools and elementary schools,'' Costescu said through a
translator. ``But handball, basketball and volleyball appeared and
oina started disappearing.''
   It has been a quarter-century since the heyday of Eugen Cocut,
the Babe Ruth of oina whose height and huge hands allowed him to
hit powerful shots and fire the ball with terrifying speed.
   If Costescu is successful in his post with the 2-month-old
baseball federation, he may assure that the next Cocut plays
baseball instead of oina.
   Costescu used to head the Romanian Oina Federation, back in the
days when baseball was banned as ``a capitalist sport.''
   That stigma was removed after the December revolution that
overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and the baseball federation
was formed.
   ``Baseball will be more popular than oina in cities, but in the
villages oina will remain,'' Costescu said. ``Even though I am the
head of the baseball federation now, oina is always in my heart.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   FETAL PROTECTION
   
   The court, accepting a case that could affect millions of
working women, said today it will review a ruling that lets
employers exclude all women of child-bearing age from some
hazardous jobs.
   The justices agreed to study an automobile battery
manufacturer's policy of banning women who cannot prove they are
infertile from jobs that expose them to lead.
   A decision is expected sometime in 1991.
   The case is International Union vs. Johnson Controls, 89-1215.
   
   ELECTRICITY RATES
   
   The court agreed to consider giving federal regulators more
authority to lower electricity rates, setting the stage for a
decision that could affect more than 49 million homes.
   The court said it will review a ruling that barred the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission from slashing rate increases to
customers in 15 Ohio communities.
   The case is Arcadia vs. Ohio Power Co., 89-1283.
   
   DEATH ROW
   
   The court agreed to hear an appeal challenging the authority of
states to house convicted murderers on ``death rows'' and keep them
apart from other inmates.
   The justices said they will review the appeal of Nebraska death
row inmate John Rust, who says such segregation is ``without
penological justification'' and ``grossly disproportionate''
punishment.
   The case is Rust vs. Gunter, 89-5900.
   
   SCHOOL DESEGREGATION
   
   The court agreed to review a ruling that, if upheld, could
reinstate forced busing for the racial desegregation of Oklahoma
City, Okla., elementary schools.
   The court must decide whether the city school board acted
lawfully when in 1985 it returned to a neighborhood schools plan
for children in kindergarten through fourth grade.
   The case is Oklahoma City Board of Education vs. Dowell, 89-1080.
   
   McMARTIN PRESCHOOL
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit stemming from one of the
nation's most publicized cases of alleged child abuse, at the
now-defunct McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, Calif.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit against a private child welfare group and one of its
therapists by two of the preschool's former teachers.
   
   ALIENS
   
   The court refused to extend a key civil rights law to protect
non-citizens from private, as well as governmental, bias.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling that
the First National Bank of Commerce in New Orleans did not
discriminate illegally against Jeetendra Bhandari when it denied
his application for a bank credit card because he is not a U.S.
citizen.
   The case is Bhandari vs. First National Bank of Commerce,
89-1258.
   
   W.R. GRACE
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a leading conglomerate found to
have fraudulently obtained a $75 million bank loan to develop
natural gas fields in Mississippi.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that could
subject W.R. Grace &amp; Co. to major punitive damages in a lawsuit by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The case is W.R. Grace vs. FDIC, 89-902.
   
   SEX MOVIES
   
   The court turned away an appeal by an Evansville, Ind., business
convicted and fined $5,000 for showing and selling movies ``harmful
to minors.''
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
conviction and fine infringe the free-speech rights of the Studio
Art Theatre's owners and violate the required separation of
government and religion.
   The case is Studio Art Theatre vs. Indiana, 89-847.
   
   RAILROADS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether railroads can ignore union
contracts to complete mergers approved by the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
   The court said it will review a ruling that restrains the
railroads and the ICC from overriding collective bargaining
agreements.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled for the unions last
July in two separate cases.
   The cases are Norfolk and Western vs. American Train
Dispatchers, 89-1027; CSX Transportation vs. Brotherhood of Railway
Carmen, 89-1928.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav
Havel is expected to be hospitalized for about a week following a
hernia operation, a spokesman said Monday.
   Havel, 53, is recovering normally after Saturday's operation,
spokesman Michael Zantovsky said. He will need about a week to
convalesce after his hospital stay.
   Havel, a dissident playwright who became president after the
country's hard-line Communist rulers were ousted, suffered from
bouts of ill health while imprisoned from 1979 to 1983 for his
opposition to the Communist government.
   He has maintained a punishing schedule since the whirlwind
peaceful revolution started in November and propelled him to the
presidency in December.
   Since taking office, he has visited both Germanys, Poland,
Hungary, Iceland, Canada, the United States, the Soviet Union,
France and Britain, besides receiving a steady stream of foreign
visitors in Prague and making trips around Czechoslovakia.

   Soybean products may help prevent
breast cancer and a new laboratory test may enable doctors to
better choose therapy for breast cancer patients, according to two
preliminary studies released Monday.
   Rats fed a soybean-containing diet showed lower breast-cancer
rates in a laboratory experiment, said Stephen Barnes, an associate
professor of pharmacology and biochemistry at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham.
   He tried the experiment after noting that soybeans are prominent
in diets of Asian countries that have lower breast-cancer rates
than the United States, he said.
   But he stressed that his work only studied rats, and his
hypothesis is not ready for experiments in people.
   ``Don't get too excited yet,'' Barnes told science writers at a
seminar sponsored by the American Cancer Society.
   ``I think what we've got here is a possibility that needs to be
pursued. ... People shouldn't be encouraged to rush into this.''
   Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute, said
he found the soybean idea ``fascinating,'' but agreed that it is
not clear whether it applies to people.
   ``This is just a hypothesis,'' he said. ``Please do not write
headlines that soybeans are good'' for preventing breast cancer.
   He also cautioned that many factors other than soybeans could
explain the low breast-cancer rates in Asian countries.
   In Barnes' study, 300 rats animals were fed diets in which
amounts of total protein and carbohydrates were kept constant but
the amount of soybean protein and carbohydrates varied.
   After the animals ate the diets for four weeks, they were given
a cancer-causing substance. Tumors began to show up after another
four weeks or so.
   Animals that ate soybean diets showed only about half as many
tumors on average as those on the soybean-free diet, Barnes said.
   Barnes said his work was financed largely by the cancer society,
with no funding from soybean companies.
   He said it is not clear what component of soybeans may suppress
breast cancer. But he said molecules of one component, called
isoflavones, bear a structural resemblance to tamoxifen, a
substance used in treating some breast-cancer patients.
   Tamoxifen works by blocking a cancer cell's ability to absorb
and use estrogen, which some cells use to fuel growth. Perhaps
isoflavones do the same thing, thus suppressing breast cancer, he
said.
   The other study presented also dealt with the use of estrogen by
breast-cancer cells.
   Cells take up estrogen by snaring it with proteins on cell
surfaces called estrogen receptors. Doctors routinely check
breast-cancer tumors to see if they have these receptors. If they
do, doctors prescribe an estrogen-blocking agent such as tamoxifen
to be used after surgery.
   If the breast-cancer tumors do not show estrogen receptors,
doctors prescribe chemotherapy instead as a followup to surgery.
   However, a woman whose tumor contains estrogen receptors may
have only a 40 percent to 80 percent chance of being helped by
anti-estrogen therapy, said Christopher Benz of the University of
California, San Francisco.
   Other tests can identify women with higher chances of
responding, but most community doctors decide on therapy after just
checking for presence of the estrogen receptor, Benz said.
   His study suggests that a new lab test may be able to identify
women who have estrogen receptors but who would not respond to
anti-estrogen therapy.
   The problem with the current test is that it fails to determine
whether the estrogen receptors it finds will work normally, he
said. Receptors are supposed to bind to a cell's genetic material
after they snare estrogen.
   In a study of 40 human tumors that had estrogen receptors, Benz
found that 40 percent contained only abnormal receptors that failed
to bind to genetic material.
   Such tumors might behave as if they lacked the receptors
altogether, and so not respond to anti-estrogen therapy, Benz said.
   To test that idea, the women from whom the tumors were taken
will have to be followed for several years, he said. If it turns
out to be true, the new test might help doctors make better
decisions about what kind of therapy to prescribe after surgery, he
said.
   Broder said the work raises an exciting question for future
research, and that ``we have to keep an open mind'' on whether the
test would be useful in treatment decisions.

   A hard-line Palestinian faction on Monday
openly challenged the PLO-backed leadership of the uprising and
staged a wildcat strike, widening a rift over tactics in the
anti-Israeli revolt.
   The strike marked the anniversary of the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty. It was the latest act of defiance by the Syrian-backed
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   In two recent leaflets, the group accused the three other
factions in the leadership coalition of softening in their struggle
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Palestinian activists who insisted on anonymity said contacts
were under way to try to resolve the feud within the leadership of
the 27-month-old rebellion. The leadership groups the Popular Front
with Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, the Palestine Communist Party,
and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``This is not the first time there have been differences, and we
were able in the past to surmount them,'' one Fatah activist said.
   Rising concern about the Popular Front's tactics prompted a rare
rebuke from the other Palestinian leadership groups recently,
including the dominant Fatah faction.
   A two-page letter, made available to The Associated Press,
criticized the group for actions that ``help nobody but the
enemies.''
   It also charged that allowing disputes to break into the open
``will not help solve the problem but will lead to a civil war.''
   The Popular Front strike closed stores and offices in the West
Bank town of Bethlehem and the neighboring villages of Beit Jala
and Beit Sahour.
   Slogans on walls, signed by the Popular Front and the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad group, called for ``burying the Camp
David accords.'' The accords led to the Israel-Egypt peace treaty
signed March 26, 1979.
   Past disputes on goals and tactics already have splintered the
uprising leadership.
   The Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, which rejects any
compromise with Israel, has for more than a year set its own strike
agenda. It often is at odds with the main underground coalition's
schedule of strikes.
   The other factions largely have acted together since a
five-point pact last July pledged cooperation and ended a rash of
torchings of rivals' cars.
   The latest rift was sparked by the decision of the united
leadership to allow merchants to open their stores for five hours a
day starting March 20. Earlier, merchants were restricted to a
three-hour work day.
   The Popular Front, in its leaflets, said the longer hours were a
sign of weakness. They said Palestinians should increase civil
disobedience by lengthening strikes, intensifying the boycott of
Israeli-made goods, staging larger demonstrations and throwing more
firebombs.
   The group's militancy has had repercussions.
   Last week, in the West Bank village of Jadideh, supporters of
the Popular Front badgered speakers from the Democratic Front until
their joint rally broke down into a brawl, Arab reports said.
   Ten days earlier, Popular Front activists ransacked and set
afire a shop owned by a Fatah supporter.
   The Palestinian uprising began in December 1987. A total of 669
Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the revolt. An
additional 199 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three Israelis
have died in the violence.

   A bomb exploded in the Dutch
Justice Ministry early Monday, and police said a group protesting
the death almost a decade ago of a hunger striker claimed
responsibility.
   The bomb went off at about 4 a.m. It caused no injuries, but
damage was estimated at $175,000, according to police spokeswoman
Bernadette Maclean.
   Later Monday, a group identifying itself as the Revolutionary
Anti-Racist Action claimed responsibility for the incident in
letters sent to an Amsterdam newspaper and the Dutch national news
agency, according to Ms. Maclean.
   She quoted the letter as saying that the bomb attack was to
protest the death in 1982 of a Spanish hunger striker identified as
Crespo Galendo. The circumstances of Galendo's death could not
immediately be established.
   The same organization claimed responsibility earlier this month
for arson attacks on two Dutch military police stations.
   In December, Spanish government buildings here were targeted in
bomb attacks that were believed to have been staged by ETA, the
Basque separatist organization.

<HEAD>Court Urged to Wait on Flag Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged Monday to wait
until its next term before reviewing a new federal law banning
desecration of the American flag.
   Protesters who burned flags here and in Seattle said the court
should reject a Bush administration request that two cases be
decided in the current court term due to end by early July. The new
term begins in October.
   The administration is appealing two rulings that said the law
violates freedom of speech and is unconstitutional under a high
court ruling last year that struck down a Texas law against flag
desecration.
   Lawyers for the protesters said it might be appropriate for the
justices to uphold the lower court rulings summarily, without
hearing orgal arguments. The attorneys said they don't oppose
full-scale review of the law by the court because the issue is so
important.
   Scheduling oral arguments next month, as the administration
requests, would not allow the challengers enough time to prepare
their case, the lawyers said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Eichman, 89-1433; U.S. v. Haggerty, 89-1434.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Finds No Grounds for Charging Honecker With Treason</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>

   Prosecutors said Monday there were no legal
grounds for charging Erich Honecker with high treason, but the
deposed Communist leader still was under investigation for
corruption and abuse of power.
   Efforts to form a new governing coalition continued to be
disrupted Monday by allegations that leading politicians had links
to the former Communist secret police.
   The office of chief prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph said two
members of Honecker's Politburo _ state security chief Erich Mielke
and Guenther Mittag, the economics minister _ also would escape
treason charges but, like Honecker, were suspected of corruption
and misusing their power.
   Treason proceedings were dropped against Joachim Herrmann,
Honecker's propaganda chief. The former Politburo member was
ordered released.
   Honecker, 77, was arrested in January after undergoing surgery
for kidney cancer, but was freed the next day, and Mielke also has
been released for health reasons. Mittag remains in custoday.
   Prosecutors had said earlier that Honecker, Mielke and Mittag
would be indicted and put on trial this month for high treason,
which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Joseph said in a statement Monday, however, that treason
indictments were not warranted and the three men also had been
cleared of conspiracy charges.
   His statement, carried by the state-run news agency ADN, accused
Honecker and his lieutenants of ``persistent breaches of the
constitution.'' It added, however, that the actions were part of a
one-party Stalinist system and suggested treason charges against
individuals would not be appropriate.
   Honecker and Mittag, 64, are accused of embezzling state funds
to build vacation homes and provide other personal comforts. A
range of accusations against Mielke, 84, stem from his control of
the formerly all-powerful state security apparatus.
   Indictments are not expected before May or June, Joseph told The
Associated Press. His spokeswoman, Elke Jurkutat, said trials
probably would not begin before summer because poor health was
slowing interrogation of all three men.
   Angry citizens forced Honecker and his wife, Margot, a former
education minister, to abandon their new home Saturday after only
one day.
   On Friday, the Honeckers moved from a two-room apartment in a
parish home outside East Berlin to a better-equipped government
residence. They returned to the church refuge after one night
because several hundred angry citizens protested in front of the
new residence.
   The past also continued to haunt winners of East Germany's first
free elections, held March 18.
   Ibrahim Boehme, leader of the Social Democratic party, denied
allegations that he had been a secret police informer, but said he
would leave the post until the suspicions were dispelled. He also
told reporters he would not take his place in the new 400-seat
Parliament until then.
   Boehme said he hoped an independent commission would examine the
files of the secret police, known as Stasi, within a week and
dispose of the allegations.
   His Social Democrats finished a distant second March 18.
   Other non-Communist politicians also have come under suspicion
of collaboration with the secret police.
   Lothar de Maiziere of the victorious Christian Democratic Union,
the probable new prime minister, has denied allegations similar to
those about Boehme. De Maiziere said Monday he believed he could
form a government within two weeks.
   Markus Meckel, who took over the Social Democrats temporarily as
Boehme's deputy, said anonymous allegations by former Stasi agents
were intended to undermine the country, cause turmoil and and
discredit the new Parliament.
   Under Honecker, who ruled for 17 years, the Stasi was used to
suppress dissent and keep tight control on all walks of life. It
had 85,000 agents and more than 100,000 informers, and kept files
on 6 million of East Germany's 16 million citizens.
   Dismantling of the secret police began after Honecker's downfall
in October. On Monday, the mayor of Rostock resigned after 50
people occupied the city hall to protest plans for 44 former Stasi
agents to become local teachers.
   Gregor Gysi, chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
Communist Party's new name, urged all 66 of its parliamentary
deputies to acknowledge any links with Stasi.
   He also proposed that departing Premier Hans Modrow, a
Communist, be made speaker of the new Parliament.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Rule on Hazardous Jobs Ban for Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will study
the power of employers to exclude females of child-bearing age from
hazardous jobs, a case that could affect millions of working women.
   The court agreed to review a ruling that let a Milwaukee-based
manufacturer of automobile batteries ban women who cannot prove
they are infertile from jobs that expose them to lead.
   The fetal protection policy is being challenged as a form of
illegal sex discrimination because it bans women from high-paying,
if hazardous, jobs.
   Exposure to lead, the principal material used in making
batteries, can be a health risk to workers and to the fetuses of
pregnant workers.
   But one judge, who dissented from an appeals court decision last
year that upheld the fetal protection policy, said the ruling also
could be applied to a broad range of employment, including
``traditional office jobs.''
   The high court's decision is expected sometime in 1991.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to decide in an Oklahoma City case whether some school
districts may abandon forced busing after achieving racial balance.
   _Voted to study an appeal from Nebraska challenging the
authority of states to house convicted murderers on ``death rows''
and keep them apart from other inmates.
   _Said it will consider giving federal regulators more authority
to lower electricity rates, setting the stage for a ruling that
could affect more than 49 million homes.
   _Refused to extend a key civil rights law to protect
non-citizens from private, as well as governmental, bias. The
justices let stand a ruling that a New Orleans bank did not
discriminate illegally against a man when it denied him a credit
card because he is not a citizen.
   _Let stand the conviction of an Indiana business for showing and
selling movies ``harmful to minors,'' rejecting arguments that the
conviction and $5,000 fine infringe free-speech rights.
   In the fetal protection case, the court must interpret a federal
law that bans sexual bias in employment.
   Since 1982 the battery division of Johnson Controls Inc. has
barred women at its factories in several states from jobs involving
exposure to lead.
   Eight employees and the United Auto Workers union challenged the
policy in court. Among the women who sued was one who had submitted
to sterilization to preserve her job and another who was a
50-year-old divorcee.
   The suit alleged that the policy violated a part of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, called Title VII.
   A federal judge ruled for Johnson Controls based on both sides'
pretrial arguments. No trial was held.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling by a
7-4 vote last Sept. 26.
   Judge John L. Coffey wrote for the appeals court that the
differing treatment of female employees was based on a ``business
necessity,'' and added, ``We are also convinced that Johnson
Controls' fetal protection policy could be upheld under the bona
fide occupational qualification defense.''
   The appeals court concluded that the policy ``is reasonably
necessary to industrial safety.''
   Three of the appeals court's four dissenting judges wrote
opinions, the most scathing by Judge Frank Easterbrook, an
appointee of President Ronald Reagan.
   Calling it ``likely the most important sex-discrimination case
in any court since ... Congress enacted Title VII,'' Easterbrook
said, ``If the majority is right, then by one estimate 20 million
industrial jobs would be closed to women, for many substances in
addition to lead pose fetal risks.''
   ``The law would allow employers to consign more women to
`women's work' while reserving better-paying but more hazardous
jobs for men,'' Easterbrook said.
   ``Cases ... show that many additional women are affected by
restrictions placed on other jobs, such as the X-ray technician
jobs that exposed embryos to radiation. Concern about emissions
from computers and their terminals has led to proposals that could
restrict access even to traditional office jobs,'' he said.
   A California appeals court recently ruled that Johnson Controls
fetal protection policy is illegal sex discrimination under that
state's law.
   Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund,
said she was pleased that the court agreed to hear the case.
   ``Employers have used women as the scapegoat of their failure to
properly evaluate the harm caused by workplace hazards on both men
and women,'' she said. ``They choose to avoid cleaning up the
workplace by excluding virtually all women from the jobs in
question _ literally avoiding their responsibility by shifting the
burden onto the backs of women workers.''

   Inspectors this morning visited more than 200
social clubs in a crackdown ordered by Mayor David Dinkins
following the deadliest city fire in 79 years. Only a fraction of
them were found to be open, but 52 safety violations were cited,
authorities said.
   ``I will tell you it will not be an endless battle,'' Dinkins
said Sunday after touring the charred Happy Land social club in the
Bronx. ``Anybody that had an opportunity to view those 87 bodies
knows that we're not going to tolerate this.''
   Previous mayors have waged a long and unsuccessful battle to
close clubs that are operating illegally. The dancing and drinking
nightspots are popular among immigrants because they are cheap.
   A task force put together by then-Mayor Edward Koch after a 1988
Bronx social club fire that killed seven people will be beefed up,
Dinkins said. Before Sunday's fire, only one team remained from the
10-team task force.
   A sweep of social clubs was conducted between midnight and 7
a.m., police said.
   Officers and task force inspectors went to 241 suspected illegal
clubs citywide and posted vacate orders at 187 of them, said Sgt.
Dick Vreeland, a police spokesman. In most cases, the orders were
posted on closed doors, because just 23 of the clubs were found to
be open for business. Fifty-two safety violations and 30 summonses
were issued.
   During the sweep, five people were arrested for weapons
possession, 11 loaded firearms recovered, cars were towed and
parking tickets issued.
   Sunday morning, in raids unrelated to the fire, a police task
force raided several social clubs in Brooklyn and arrested five
people for weapons possession, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police
spokeswoman.
   Albert Scardino, the mayor's press secretary, said police list
about 1,220 clubs without liquor licenses, with about 1,000
considered inactive. The Happy Land was considered inactive.
   ``They range from a group of elderly men who get together to
play cards and watch a ballgame on a Sunday afternoon to
full-fledged nightclub operations,'' said Richard Chernela, a state
Liquor Authority spokesman.
   The number of clubs citywide is hard to pin down since they can
spring up overnight, often in a dank basement or abandoned building.
   A review of city records Sunday turned up 173 social clubs that
had been ordered vacated. Inspectors were told to make sure the 173
are closed. There was no immediate explanation of how other clubs
visited today were selected.
   If the illegal clubs are not shut immediately, Dinkins had said,
``we'll see to it that they certainly aren't open come the next
weekend.''
   Sunday's fire occurred 79 years to the day after a blaze at the
Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in New York City that claimed 145 lives,
many of them immigrant garment workers. That blaze led to reforms
around the nation in workplace safety.
   Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's
implication of exclusivity. The Happy Land charged $5 for admission.
   Despite periodic campaigns to close them, many of the clubs have
become centers of urban problems, from noise and double-parking to
gambling, prostitution and drug dealing.
   The clubs often are rife with building, health and fire code
violations that can lead to tragedy. Five people died in a Brooklyn
club fire in 1985, and 25 people were killed in a Bronx fire in
1976.
   ``People are literally taking their lives in their hands at
these clubs,'' Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said.
   Dinkins said a vacate order was issued in November 1988 against
the Happy Land because the club did not have a proper sprinkler
system, exits, emergency lighting and signs.
   City records show an arrest was made there on July 24 and the
club was closed again on Nov. 1, he said.
   City officials said the building was sold last year to Karl
Rubman, but Dinkins said it was unclear who owns the property now.
Residents said the manager of the club was Elias Colon. The Daily
News reported that Colon's wife, Elena, was one of the survivors of
the fire.
   Some said it may be impossible to close the social clubs
completely.
   ``Our experience in the city in the last 20 years demonstrates
that clearly,'' said William Kornblum, director of the Center for
Social Research at the City University of New York Graduate School.
   Many people, especially those from poor neighborhoods where
affordable alternatives are scarce, go to the clubs looking for a
place to socialize where they feel welcome.
   Some clubs are closed under the city's 1984 padlock law, which
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are
committed on the site within a 12-month period.
   But the owners, if they can be located, are rarely convicted.
   Even when the clubs are shuttered, an owner may reopen around
the corner or down the street, attracting the same crowd.

   The daughter of a British nurse jailed in Iraq
for driving a journalist to an Iraqi military installation visited
her mother Monday, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
   The journalist, Farzad Bazoft, was accused of spying and hanged
March 15. The nurse, Daphne Parish, was ordered imprisoned 15 years.
   Michelle de Vries saw her mother Monday, and also visited her
Saturday and Sunday at Abu Ghraid prison, the Foreign Office
spokesman said.
   Mrs. Parish, 53, last saw her daughter in December when the two
were allowed a 20-minute visit, the spokesman said. Mrs. Parish is
sharing a cell with four Iraqi women, the British news agency Press
Association reported.
   The British government is continuing a low-key campaign to get
Mrs. Parish released, according to a variety of press reports.
   She and Bazoft were tried and convicted in connection with a
visit Bazoft made to an Iraqi military complex in September. The
Iraqi government accused him of spying, a charge he denied.
   Bazoft was working for The Observer, a London weekly newspaper.

   A man bounced from a Bronx social club for
quarreling with an ex-girlfriend returned with a jug of gasoline
and set a fire that killed 87 people at the nightspot, which had
been ordered closed, police said.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was charged with multiple counts of murder
and arson in the pre-dawn blaze Sunday at the Happy Land social
club, police Sgt. Edward Burns said.
   He appeared early this morning in Bronx County Criminal Court
and was ordered held without bail and placed in an isolated cell
under a suicide watch in a Rikers Island jail, Burns said.
   Meanwhile, authorities launched a crackdown on social clubs,
drinking and dancing nightspots that proliferate in New York's poor
neighborhoods and often operate without proper licenses and safety
features. Happy Land was operating despite a 1988 closure order
that cited safety violations including improper exits.
   Most of the dead suffocated in thick smoke in the pre-dawn blaze
Sunday, authorities said. Some people were trampled to death;
others broke a hole through a wall to an adjoining hall in a
desperate attempt to escape.
   Emergency workers described bodies felled by smoke so quickly
that they still had their legs wrapped around a bar stool, gripped
drinks or held hands. Only three people managed to reach safety by
way of the two doors on the front of the two-story Happy Land
social club.
   ``People literallywere stacked on top of each other,'' said
Anthony De Vita, the Fire Department's command chief. ``It was a
firetrap.''
   Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant and former boyfriend of a Happy
Land's ticket seller, was thrown out of the club after a quarrel in
which he tried to woo back the woman, police said.
   After warning, ``I'll be back,'' he returned with a jug of
gasoline, sprinkled the fuel on the floor and lit it, said Lt.
James Malvey.
   Gonzalez cried with remorse under questioning, said Lt. Raymond
O'Donnell, a police spokesman. ``Basically, he's saying he did
it,'' O'Donnell said.
   Authorities early today inspected more than 200 social clubs
across the city, finding most of them closed. Vacate orders were
posted at 187 of them, and 52 safety violation notices were issued,
said Sgt. Dick Vreeland, a police spokesman. In addition, five
people were arrested for weapons possessions.
   On Sunday, officials had said a review of city records showed at
least 173 social clubs had been ordered to shut down in the past,
and Mayor David Dinkins ordered officials to make sure they were
closed.
   It was the deadliest fire in the continental United States since
the 1977 blaze at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in Southgate, Ky.,
that killed 164 people. A New Year's Eve 1986 fire at a hotel in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, killed 97.
   The fire occurred exactly 79 years after a blaze at the Triangle
Shirtwaist Co. in New York City, a garment factory, that claimed
145 lives. That blaze led to reforms around the nation in workplace
safety.
   At a ceremony today marking the Triangle fire, Dinkins referred
to Sunday's club fire, noting that in both cases most of the
victims were immigrants. As in 1911, he said, ``there are those
operating in the shadows, running sweatshops and illegal social
clubs and pursuing other schemes, turning the lure and promise of
America into a nightmare for those who seek to redeem the
promise.'' The ceremony had been scheduled long before Sunday's
fire.
   After Sunday's fire, the impoverished Latino neighborhood near
the Bronx Zoo was thick with mourners, who were asked to identify
relatives from snapshots of the bodies posted on the wall of a high
school.
   Killed were 61 men and 26 women, most of them Honduran and
Dominican immigrants.
   ``Most of the bodies were in dance clothes,'' Emergency Medical
Services specialist Christopher McCarthy said. ``They were out to
have fun.''
   Alva Romero, a Honduran immigrant, lost six relatives, including
a daughter, both brothers and a sister. Jerome Ford lost five
relatives. The local Honduran soccer club lost several players.
   The government in Honduras today expressed regret over the fire.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro said officials were
``deeply moved by the deaths of many countrymen in New York.''
   Happy Land was ordered shut in November 1988 and again a year
later because of inadequate exits, sprinkler systems, emergency
lighting and signs, Dinkins said. It had no liquor or cabaret
license.
   City officials said the building was sold last year to Karl
Rubman, but Dinkins said it was unclear who owns the property now.
Residents said the manager of the club was Elias Colon. The Daily
News reported that Colon's wife, Elena, was one of the survivors of
the fire.
   Despite their name, the social clubs admit anyone. Happy Land
charged a $5 admission price at the door; its illegally served
drinks cost about $3 each.
   ``I will tell you it will not be an endless battle,'' the mayor
said in announcing the crackdown on illegal clubs. ``Anybody that
had an opportunity to view those 87 bodies knows that we're not
going to tolerate this.''
   Mayor Ed Koch, Dinkins' predecessor, made a similar promise
after a 1988 Bronx social club fire killed seven people. The clubs
are popular among poor immigrants.
   Two rickety staircases lead to the second-story dance floor
where most of the bodies were found. Disc jockey Ruben Valladares,
who spun reggae, salsa and calypso records, ran through the flames
and was hospitalized with severe burns.
   At least two other women escaped. Their condition was unknown.
   ``People were screaming; they were all burned,'' said Rosemary
Green, who found the club on fire when she arrived to meet her
sister-in-law and cousin. ``Once you got in the entrance there was
no way to get out.''
   Gonzalez, an unemployed warehouse worker, came to the United
States on the Mariel boatlift in 1980, O'Donnell said.
   Police said he went into the club about 3 a.m. and began arguing
with the woman.
   ``He's trying to talk her into making up; she's saying `Leave me
alone,''' O'Donnell said. The man's ex-girlfriend left before the
fire, which was reported at 3:41 a.m., Brown said. Police withheld
her identity.
   Denise Garcia, 20, a filing clerk who lives in the neighborhood,
said she and her friends avoided the club because they considered
it ``too sleazy.'' The building was rickety and the dance floor
sometimes trembled, she said.
   One firefighter broke a leg; 13 of his colleagues also were
injured.
   Gonzalez was charged with two counts of arson, 87 counts of
murder in the course of arson, 87 counts of murder by depraved
indifference to human life and one count of attempted murder.

<TEXT>
   John Dexter, a theater and opera director whose
productions included such stage hits as ``Equus'' and ``M.
Butterfly'' as well as operas at Covent Garden and New York's
Metropolitan Opera House, has died at age 64.
   The Times of London said his death Friday in a London hospital
was due to heart failure.
   Dexter was best known on Broadway for his direction of ``Equus''
in 1974 and ``M. Butterfly'' in 1988, both of which won him Tony
awards. He made his Broadway debut in 1963 with Arnold Wesker's
``Chips with Everything.''
   Among his other notable Broadway productions were ``Black
Comedy'' and ``The Royal Hunt of the Sun,'' both written by Peter
Shaffer, and ``Do I Hear a Waltz?,'' the Richard Rodgers-Stephen
Sondheim musical.
   Dexter's last Broadway assignment was the ill-fated ``3 Penny
Opera,'' starring rock idol Sting, which closed in December after a
short run.
   Dexter began his theater career at the Royal Court in 1957 and
then was asked by Laurence Olivier to join the National Theater as
an associate director. There he directed ``Othello,'' with Olivier
playing the title role and Maggie Smith as Desdemona. Among his
other successes at the National were ``The Misanthrope,'' with Alec
McCowen and Diana Rigg, ``Hobson's Choice'' and ``Phaedra
Britannica'' with Rigg.
   Dexter directed his first opera in 1966, a revival of Berlioz'
``Benvenuto Cellini'' at Covent Garden and later worked at the
Hamburg State Opera, the Paris Opera and the Metropolitan Opera in
New York. At the Met, he directed productions of such diverse
operas as ``I Vespri Sicilani, ``Dialogues of the Carmelites,''
``Lulu,'' ``The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,'' ``Billy
Budd'' and ``Parade,'' a triple bill of French operas with scenery
by artist David Hockney.
   Dexter, the son of a plumber, was born in the northern England
town of Derby. He left school at 14 to work in a factory and
discovered acting while in the army.
   There was no word on survivors.

   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
whether school districts may abandon forced busing of students
after once achieving racial balance in their schools.
   The justices will review a ruling that, if upheld, could
reinstate forced busing for the racial desegregation of elementary
schools in Oklahoma City.
   At issue is the effect of a federal judge's ruling in 1977 that
the city's public schools had become fully integrated and no longer
had to be under court supervision.
   The city in 1985 returned to a neighborhood schools plan for
children in kindergarten through fourth grade, ending the racial
balance achieved by crosstown busing of elementary school pupils.
   By 1986, 33 of the school district's 64 elementary schools were
90 percent black or white, and some parents called the neighborhood
schools plan a tool of ``resegregation.''
   Hundreds of school districts, including those in most major
cities, operate court-ordered busing plans for racial
desegregation. Only a few have persuaded courts to declare their
once-segregated systems fully integrated.
   Nevertheless, the potential impact of the high court's decision,
expected sometime in 1991, is enormous.
   The issue gained national attention when the Reagan
administration helped bring about a halt to court-ordered busing of
elementary school pupils in Norfolk, Va.
   The Norfolk school district was allowed to return to a
neighborhood schools plan in 1986.
   William Bradford Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's
Civil Rights Division when it entered the Norfolk case in 1984,
said the same legal principles could apply to ``many, many other
school districts around the country.''
   In the Oklahoma City case, a federal appeals court last Oct. 6
disapproved the neighborhood schools plan.
   Oklahoma City public schools once were racially segregated by
law. Black parents sued in 1961 to end the lasting effects of such
segregation, and in 1972 forced busing was begun as part of a
court-ordered desegregation plan.
   U.S. District Judge Luther Bohanon ruled in 1977 that the school
district had become fully integrated, and ended court supervision.
   School officials continued the crosstown busing, however, until
1985 when children in kindergarten through fourth grade were
allowed to attend the school nearest their home.
   Some black parents challenged the neighborhood schools plan,
although other black parents had criticized the busing program.
   Bohanon ruled that the 1972 desegregation plan no longer had to
be enforced because federal court supervision ended with his 1977
declaration.
   But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in October that
federal court supervision in such cases ``extends beyond the
termination of the wrongdoing.''
   The appeals court said the Oklahoma City school board has a
continuing duty to refrain from any action that could weaken racial
balance in the public schools. It ordered Bohanon to study
``alternatives to maintain racially balanced elementary schools.''
   The 10th Circuit court's ruling appears to conflict with federal
appeals court rulings in the Norfolk case and one from Austin,
Texas.
   In each of those, an appeals court ruled that judicial
supervision ends when a previously segregated school district is
found to be fully integrated, or ``unitary.''
   In a friend-of-the-court brief, the National School Boards
Association urged the justices to use the Oklahoma City case ``to
resolve what constitutes a unitary school system and determine the
effect of a declaration of unitary.''

   President Bush on Monday called a
once-homeless woman who established a program to help homeless
families in Kansas City, Mo., to congratulate her on being his
100th ``point of light.''
   ``You know what it is. You've been through it yourself, been
homeless,'' Bush told Barbara Tomblinson.
   Mrs. Tomblinson founded New Start-New Life Ministries, which
provides transitional housing for homeless families. The families
are required to find employment within two weeks and save half
their earnings.
   ``Barbara and I were so moved by your own effort, your own
history of helping homeless families and setting a great example
for a lot of other Americans,'' Bush said. ``So for that reason I
wanted to call and say congratulations.''
   Mrs. Tomblinson is the 100th recipient of Bush's daily award
recognizing individuals and groups that exemplify his ``thousand
points of light'' theme of volunteerism and community service.
   The president's phone call was piped in over the PA system in
the White House press room.
   Bush told Mrs. Tomblinson he knew there were many volunteers
working in the program.
   ``I just hope you'll be able to give each one a hug and say
thanks,'' he said.
   ``I'll do that just for you,'' Mrs. Tomblinson said.
   Those honored as points of light get a plaque and a letter from
the president.

   Some towns have favorite sons. In James
T. Kirk, Riverside has a future son.
   Each year, futuristic enthusiasts in this eastern Iowa town of
800 celebrate the upcoming March 22, 2228, birthday of Kirk,
captain of the Starship Enterprise in the TV series ``Star Trek.''
   The Trekkies gathered for Kirk's minus 238th birthday Saturday
night at a Riverside hall dressed in their space-age finest.
   They have marked the birthday since Riverside adopted Kirk as
its hometown boy in 1985. Creators of the show say Kirk was born in
an Iowa barbershop but don't reveal his hometown.
   ``If you saw this in New York City, you wouldn't think anything
of it. To see it in Riverside, Iowa, is what makes it bizarre,''
said Shawn Paris, a self-described ``galactic artist.''
   Paris has created an art piece he calls ``Quantum Destiny'' that
will be placed in a titanium time capsule and buried in 1991 behind
the site of a former barbershop in Riverside to mark the series'
25th anniversary. It will be opened on Kirk's birthday.

   If the price of groceries should rub you the wrong
way and you need a quick fix, try a supermarket massage.
   For $5, one of 14 therapists at the Whole Foods Market will give
a 10-minute neck and shoulder massage. The program began about six
months ago, and customers are lining up.
   ``It should be self-explanatory why we have it,'' said night
manager Colin Marsh. ``Dallas is a highly stress-inducing city.
   ``It's a very integral part of our business,'' he said. ``Some
people come in just for massages. It's very popular.''
   The massage area had been in the center of the store, but is now
in a less conspicuous area because of objections from some
customers.
   ``The customer is fully clothed and no oil is used,'' said
therapist Bridget McGee. ``And you just hit pressure points.''
   ``A lot of people come in every day, and others just once a
week,'' she said. ``Weekends are busy, and weekdays about noon.''
   Some of the staff are partaking.
   ``Sometimes I'll get one when I'm in the middle of the shift and
have had to deal with what you might say are some very
diplomatic-oriented situations,'' Marsh said.

   A pair of peregrine falcons whose
high-rise hijinks captivated cable television viewers last summer
return to the airwaves Monday.
   The all-day broadcast of two birds who don't do much more than
putter about on a 21st-story ledge proved more popular than
expected.
   ``It amazes me that someone can sit and watch the birds hour
after hour,'' said Brian Lambert, general manager of Continental
Cablevision. ``I am one of them. It stays on in the office all day
long. We just kind of wait to see the bird move or the eggs or
whatever. It's mesmerizing.''
   The 43,000-subscriber cable company mounted a camera near the
falcons' nest on a ledge of the 23-story Monarch Place office
building last year and televised the video on a channel devoted to
educational programming.
   Tom French, director of the state's endangered species program,
said the show is more than an entertaining glimpse of nature.
   ``It's an incredible opportunity,'' he said. ``It's absolutely
incredible that they're so visible. We can look at the egg tooth.
That's minute.''
   Among last season's highlights were the first hatchings of young
peregrine falcons in western Massachusetts in 40 years and a
thriller episode in June when French rappelled down the side of the
building to rescue a baby falcon that was choking on a piece of
meat. Alert viewers had noticed the chick's distress and jammed the
company's switchboard.
   This season, the first egg is expected to appear in early April,
the first hatching in mid-May and the first fledgling flights near
the end of June.

   A man convicted of raping and sexually
mutilating a 7-year-old boy was sentenced today to more than 130
years in prison, three times the standard term for the crime.
   In sentencing Earl Shriner, Pierce County Superior Court Judge
Thomas R. Sauriol said the case left him more troubled and outraged
than any in his 37-year legal career.
   ``I don't think that I have ever heard of a case that borders on
extreme cruelty more than this one,'' Sauriol said. ``The reality
is, Mr. Shriner, you present a danger to the defenseless.''
   Shriner, 40, has a long history of violence toward young people.
   He was convicted Feb. 7 of first degree attempted murder, two
counts of first-degree rape and first-degree assault. The child was
choked and his penis was cut off in the attack May 20 in a wooded
area near his south Tacoma home.
   The victim's mother, Helen Harlow, dabbing her eyes and
comforted by numerous friends, said she was satisfied with the
sentence because it would in effect be a life sentence.
   The attack created an uproar in the state about sex predators,
and was one of the cases cited as being instrumental in passage of
legislation to deal more strictly with them, including longer
sentences, civil commitment and registration of sex offenders.
   Under state law, the standard range for the offenses with
someone of Shriner's record is 34 years to 43 years, eight months.
The approximately 131-year sentence was three times the high end of
the standard range.
   In reaching his sentence, which the defense said would be
appealed, Sauriol accepted almost all the 13 aggravating factors
cited by prosecutors as reasons to go above the standard sentence.
But he rejected the state's proposal for a sentence of more than
250 years _ six times the maximum under standard sentencing
guidelines.
   The boy's mother has said her son continues with his recovery,
including reconstructive surgery. A trust fund of hundreds of
thousands of dollars that poured in after the attack on the boy is
paying for the surgery.
   Shriner has a 24-year history of violent attacks on young
people. He has been confined at Rainier School for the retarded;
Western State Hospital, a mental institution; and the Washington
Corrections Center.
   The 7-year-old boy was found by neighbors after the attack,
bloody, naked, covered with mud and practically incoherent. A
fellow jail inmate testified during the trial that Shriner admitted
mutilating the boy.

<HEAD>Sasser Says Pentagon Renovation Out of the Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate panel on military
construction said Monday that a Bush administration request for
$1.1 billion to renovate the Pentagon is ``out of the question.''
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., acknowledged that the 47-year-old
building is in need of repair but said the administration's call
for $1.1 billion over seven years would be difficult to heed in a
time of shrinking budgets.
   ``The military construction bill is going to get smaller not
larger,'' Sasser told Pentagon officials at a Senate hearing.
``There's simply no room for such an undertaking.''
   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
military construction faulted past defense secretaries for failing
to get the General Services Administration to provide sufficient
funds for the building's upkeep.
   The GSA owns the Pentagon building, with transfer of control to
the Defense Department expected some time this year.
   ``I'm not persuaded that we ought to ask the taxpayers to come
up with another billion dollars to provide new office space for
those who work in the Pentagon and to expand it,'' Sasser said.
   ``Perhaps it's time to take a hard look at scaling back some of
the Pentagon staff.''
   David J. Berteau, the Pentagon's principal deputy assistant
secretary for production and logistics, said that if he cut his
staff in half he would ``not leave a dent in the Pentagon because
those people are not located in the Pentagon as it is now.''
   Sasser, who also chairs the Senate Budget Committee, said
spending a billion dollars or more ``to buy new offices for the
Pentagon is just out of the question ... in the budgetary climate
that I see coming.''
   The Pentagon, the largest office building in the world, has 17.5
miles of corridors, 131 stairways, 19 escalators and 13 elevators,
and covers 29 acres in northern Virginia.

   Flames were spotted Monday in an engine of a TWA
jetliner carrying 176 people, forcing the pilot to abort takeoff.
Seven passengers sustained minor injuries while sliding down
evacuation chutes, officials said.
   The Logan International control tower alerted the crew of Flight
31 less than a minute into the 9:30 a.m. takeoff for St. Louis and
Los Angeles, said Thomas J. Kinton, deputy director of aviation
with the Massachusetts Port Authority.
   The L-1011 jetliner taxied off the runway and chutes were
deployed to help the 163 passengers get off the plane, said Phil
Orlandella, an agency spokesman.
   The injured were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital for
treatment of floor burns and twisted ankles.
   He said ground crews found no smoke or fire when they inspected
the engine.

<HEAD>From Underwear to Outerwear _ a Splashy Style Show</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borrowing from the ski slopes, the riding ring, the
great outdoors or the bedroom, splashy ready-to-wear styles for
next fall are heavily influenced by active sportswear or fetching
lingerie styles.
   The opening of the East also was celebrated during shows last
week in folkloric Russian or Central European looks called
``International Ethnic'' by Women's Wear Daily.
   South-of-the-border and African animal-print themes inspired
other clothes that were happily more wearable than costume-like.
   The main younger silhouette is usually a leggy form clad in
colorful tights, cigarette-slim trousers or stretch stirrup pants a
la St. Moritz.
   Sometimes a miniskirt or tunic tops the tights, but fitted
jackets, redingotes and swirly babydoll toppers add to looks that
go from flippy to top-heavy.
   Th runways ran riot with drawstring parkas or fur-lined anoraks
with hoods. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel even dressed up his evening
wear with shimmering satin quilted ski jackets.
   Castelbajac, who always does bright sportswear-based clothes,
was still a winner with his handsome mohair-hooded greatcoats, his
primary color parkas or duffels, his tunic-and-tights knitwear.
   As sportswear and outerwear became indoor wear, underwear also
took a flirtatious bow in cocktail clothes, with wasp-waisted lacy
merry widow looks at Lacroix, Hanae Mori, Lecoanet-Hemant and
elsewhere.
   And then there was the super appeal of the ethnic clothes. They
looked great as done by the top creators: Ungaro, Lacroix, Romeo
Gigli and Yves Saint Laurent.
   Saint Laurent, who showed the first great Russian rich-ethnic
styles in 1976, was in a hospital suffering from mental and
physical exhaustion, missing his opening. But his bouncy, quilted
and flowered new versions of the happy peasant look were a charming
update.
   Watch for shimmering velvet-printed long skirts and bright
quilted toppers shot with lame threads, moire skirts and belted
tunics in neon-hot colors, plus tassels, sequins and
``passementerie'' ribbon decor.
   But styles marched right back from the 1960s as well, updated
with elegant thigh-high suede or flower-printed boots at Ungaro
teamed with some of the stretch pants and mini-tunics.
   With eye-catching tricolored lean tunics or minis with tights
and the high boots, plus clothes in big Mondrian-inspired blocks of
color, many were talking about Pierre Cardin's ghost hovering over
it all.
   Cardin, whose avant-garde ideas of the 1960s still seem to work
in the leg-baring 1990s, is in fact alive and doing so well he
doesn't even need to give a ready-to-wear show.
   In the pyramid or trapeze coat line, look for the basic shape
and fabulous fabrics at Montana, a master at styling this
silhouette.
   For the best redingote, look to Dior, where designer Gianfranco
Ferre gave the house refinement and new kick with superb cuts and
hot reds like the ``pink'' riders' coats.
   Another popular coat was the full-skirted or slimmer trench,
which turned into a dress at Chanel.
   Day wear was not totally for the leggy, as many designers showed
slim pants and a few paraded fullish longer skirts. Daytimes were
sometimes festively dressed up with lame and sparkles or touches of
satin and chiffon in blouses in outfits that might pass at a
liberal office before the wearer leaves for the cocktail hour.
   Evening wear was one big fete, with acres of passementerie,
gold-braided ``galloons,'' jeweled and velvet embroidery. Minxy
decollete styles and bubble dresses were tempered with plenty of
little black dresses in all kinds of soft fabrics and silhouettes.
   Color schemes for next fall run the gamut from subdued
chocolate, khaki, mustard, camel, gray and wine to neon pinks or
greens. Brights are a big hit as Paris is seeing red: with flame
red, crimson, orange, fuchsia and cyclamen leading the way.
   Little touches make the difference in Paris fashion. You can
look for all kinds of silky print shawls and fringed stoles, velvet
berets or pillboxes, chain belts with big cabochon stones, chunky
bracelets, necklaces and drop earrings to dress up a wardrobe.
   After the marathon week of ready-to-wear with at least 100 shows
under tents raised in the Louvre's Cour Carre courtyard and other
locations around town, Paris was being touted as the world capital
of fashion.
   Now that top Japanese, Italian and English creators like
Katherine Hamnett and John Galliano have defected to show in Paris,
the big question is whether Americans will hop on the bandwagon.
   Jacques Mouclier, president of the French Fashion Federation and
Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, said a $77 million underground
fashion complex is planned under the Tuileries gardens near the
Louvre.

<TEXT>
   Hungarians applied the West's rules of
fair play to their first free election in 43 years, but not its
efficient tabulation of results.
   Only 69 percent of the votes cast in Sunday's election were
counted by late Monday.
   The state news agency MTI said the conservative Hungarian
Democratic Forum led with about one-quarter of the votes, the
center-left League of Free Democrats had roughly 20 percent and the
Socialists, the new name adopted by the Communists, were a distant
fourth after the Independent Smallholders party.
   With no party given a chance of winning a majority in
Parliament, a coalition government is likely after runoff elections
next month.
   Hungarians like to consider themselves closer to the modern West
than to the East, which they derisively call ``The Balkans'' or
``Asia,'' but the election provides little evidence of Western
technical efficiency.
   International monitors expressed satisfaction with the vote's
fairness, but the reporting of results has been an agonizing
process.
   East Germany held the first free election among former Soviet
satellites on March 18, and provided projections of the outcome
soon after polls closed. Provisional final results were available
five hours after the last vote was cast and official results were
announced the next morning.
   The East Germans had West German computers and knew how to use
them. The Hungarians had modern computers, but appeared incapable
of using them.
   Gleaming banks of computer terminals were on prominent display
at election committee headquarters in the parliament building and
in state television's election studio.
   Shortly after the polls closed, the television began a scheduled
24-hour broadcast, complete with an inspiring musical theme and
elaborate graphics.
   The computer screens remained blank. Election officials decided
at the last minute, not explaining why, to tally the more than 5
million ballots by hand and use computers only for a final check.
   That also crippled state television's computer system, which
depended partially on feeds from the election committee network.
Commentators mumbled excuses and read handwritten partial results.
   Some attempts to draw on the computers were embarrassing.
Commentators presented an analysis of early partial results from a
rural election district, only to find that it was a test graphic
with imaginary candidates and percentages.
   Members of a television panel trying to explain inconclusive and
sometimes misleading data gave up before dawn Monday.
   ``What do you expect? This is Hungary,'' philosopy professor
Mihaly Vajda said to the other panelists. ``I would suggest we try
to analyze what we have. We could only be wrong. For all we know,
we may be the only people up.''
   Panel member Peter Kende, a Hungarian who teaches political
science at the Sorbonne in Paris, said: ``It's a little hard to
believe that we've been sitting around for seven hours and we still
don't know anything.''
   Television reporters across the country were reporting local
results of less than 10 percent hours after the pollis colsed.
   Hostesses at the International Press Center tried to placate
hundreds of journalists with a trickle of results from MTI, the
state news agency, but the large television screen that was
supposed to carry quick results and projections remained blank.
   Attempts to obtain substantive comment from party leaders were
frustrated because it was impossible to be certain who was ahead.
   At dawn, more than 12 hours after the voting ended, MTI made its
initial report of a trend.

   The Bush administration Monday hailed initial
results of Hungary's first free parliamentary elections in more
than four decades.
   ``We are encouraged by the elections as an indication of further
movement along the path of democratic development for the Hungarian
people,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Partial results of the weekend election indicated voters
overwhelmingly chose opposition candidates over Communist
reformers, and that it appeared likely that a coalition of
opposition parties would run Hungary.
   Fitzwater noted that there was a tight contest between two
non-communist factions _ the conservative Hungarian Democratic
Forum and the liberal League of Free Democrats. The Socialists, the
successor to the Communists who once ruled the Warsaw Pact nation,
were trailing badly.
   ``Eastern Europe is undergoing dramatic economic and political
changes,'' Fitzwater said. ``Hungary has been one of the countries
in the forefront of these changes.''

<TEXT>
   A mother who went to jail for two
years rather than reveal her daughter's whereabouts during a
custody battle wants to stay in New Zealand to live with the girl,
it was reported Monday.
   The TV3 television network quoted Dr. Elizabeth Morgan's current
husband, Paul Michel, as saying his wife hopes to resume her career
as a plastic surgeon in New Zealand and live with 7-year-old Hilary
Foretich.
   Ms. Morgan flew last month from Washington to New Zealand, where
Hilary had been secretly living with her maternal grandparents,
after investigators for Ms. Morgan's ex-husband found her.
   Ms. Morgan was jailed for 25 months until last fall for refusing
to say where Hilary was living. She alleged the girl's father, her
ex-husband Erich Foretich, sexually abused the child.
   Foretich, of Falls Church, Va., denies abusing Hilary. He said
in an interview from his home Monday that he expected his wife to
take up residence in New Zealand.
   ``I have known that for several days, and had predicted that
would be her course of action long before that,'' he said.
   Michel said he was prevented from applying for permanent
residency because he is a federal judge and must live in Washington.
   ``I expect that my wife will stay here. So I hope to be a
frequent visitor to your lovely city,'' Michel told TV3.
   Hilary's maternal grandparents spirited the child to Britain and
then to Christchurch, New Zealand, where Foretich's investigators
found her last month. She had been attending a private school.
   Foretich was accused by his former wife of hunting his daughter
``like an animal'' when he arrived in New Zealand last month to see
the girl.
   A New Zealand court is to rule on the girl's future. Lawyers for
the two parties have not announced a date for the court hearing,
and reporters have been barred from the proceedings.

<TEXT>
   A former Labor Ministry official accused of
receiving bribes from a company at the center of a major political
bribery scandal was sentenced to one year in prison Monday, an
official at the Tokyo District Court said.
   Shigeru Kano, 56, former head of the ministry's Job Security
Division, was also fined $8,700. Judge Akinori Matsumoto suspended
the prison term for three years.
   ``He maintained a corrupt relationship with Recruit Co. without
reservations, and should be held responsible for being repeatedly
entertained from the company,'' Matsumoto said.
   The sentencing was the first in a series of trials in the
widespread influence-peddling affair known as the Recruit scandal,
which rocked Japanese politics for more than a year.
   The scandal centers around the information and publishing
conglomerate Recruit Co., which tried to buy influence by spreading
cash and bargain-priced shares in a subsidiary to hundreds of
politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders.
   The affair led to the indictment of 12 politicians, public
officials and corporate executives for bribery. They are being
tried in five separate trials which began last November.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party's links to Recruit
triggered strong public distrust toward the party and government.
The scandal led to the resignations of two prime ministers and cost
the party its long-held majority in Parliament's upper house last
July.
   Kano, who was in a position to supervise the employment
information industry between 1982-85, was wined and dined by
Recruit at least 41 times, and received various gifts including

<HEAD>Deputies Tear Down Protest Tents in Selma Schools Conflict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Deputies removed two tents from the City Hall
lawn Monday after a judge temporarily limited a protest over the
impending dismissal of Selma's first black school superintendent.
   ``It went rather peaceful,'' Dallas County Sheriff W.D.
``Cotton'' Nichols said after the tents, pitched by demonstrators
on Saturday, were removed at about 6 a.m.
   City police later arrested a man who allegedly tried to take a
video camera from a police officer who was recording the
dismantling of the tents. One of the demonstrators, Ronald Peoples,
28, was charged with theft and disorderly conduct, said police
Chief M.E. Summerlin.
   The protesters are seeking a three-year contract extension for
Superintendant Norward Roussell, whose $80,000-a-year contract
expires in June. The six white members of the 11-member Selma Board
of Education voted in December not to renew the contract. Roussell
has filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the board.
   Circuit Judge Leslie Johnson signed the temporary order Sunday
night limiting the demonstrations conducted by a group called Best
Education Support Team.
   The judge ordered the sheriff to remove tents if the group
refused to take them down. Nichols said Monday his office ``was
just carrying out the court order.''
   The judge's order also barred the group from cooking on City
Hall property. The sheriff referred to this as ``no more chicken
eating and watermelon cutting.''
   The order also bars the protesters from disrupting traffic or
encouraging disorderly conduct.
   The order by Johnson followed unsuccessful rounds of
negotiations between attorneys for the city and the protest group.
It also came after demonstrators renewed their campout at City Hall
and directed chants at tourists taking part in Selma's annual
Historic Pilgrimage tour.
   ``We are protesting the pilgrimage because they refuse to deal
with current issues,'' said a demonstration leader, Dallas County
Commissioner Perry Varner, referring to city officials.
   City Attorney Henry Pitts said the demonstrators showed ``a
complete lack of respect for the judicial system'' by violating a
March 10 order limiting the protest. ``It makes it very difficult
to negotiate with people who want to negotiate with mob rule,'' he
said.
   J.L. Chestnut, an attorney for the protesters, said some
supporters of the demonstration ``have been disappointed that the
negotiations have gone on so long, and they may have run out of
patience.''

   Assailants opened fire with submachine guns and
rifles on a bus carrying Azerbaijanis in the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, killing at least one person, a report from
Azerbaijan said Monday.
   The assailants were not identified, but the attack followed an
outbreak of violence in the ethnically torn Caucasus region that
left at least nine people dead.
   Reports from Azerbaijan on Monday also said Armenian
nationalists hurled a homemade bomb from an ambulance in the
republic.
   The official Tass news agency reported the bus attack Monday
night but did not make clear when it occurred. It said one person
was killed and four were injured.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of the Armenian-Azerbaijani
dispute and has been in a state of virtual civil war for two years.
   Azerbaijan's Azerinform news agency said Armenian extremists
hurled a bomb from an ambulance as it was traveling through the
village of Bala Jafarly in the Kazakhsky district of Azerbaijan.
   Windows in several houses were shattered, but there were no
reports of injuries, the news agency said. It said the attack
occurred shortly after midnight Sunday.
   On Monday, Armenians fired automatic weapons on the nearby
village of Keirumly, again causing no injuries, it said.
   Officials from Armenia's Armenpress news agency said they could
not communicate with the area and had no information about the
events there. Independent confirmation of the Azerinform account
was not possible.
   In recent days, seven people have been reported killed in
attacks on Azerbaijanis in the Kazakhsky district, and two
Armenians reportedly died when an anti-aircraft shell exploded
prematurely.
   The outbreak of violence was the most serious in the region
since anti-Armenian riots in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku broke
out Jan. 13.
   Soviet troops entered the city a week later to quell the unrest.
   According to official figures, at least 197 people were killed
in the January violence, including 125 who died after the arrival
of Soviet soldiers in Baku.
   The dispute between Armenians, who are mostly Christians, and
Azerbaijanis, who are mainly Moslem, goes back decades. It erupted
anew two years ago over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave
that is located in and administered by Azerbaijan. Armenians want
to annex the region.
   Soviet media said the latest deaths included an Azerbaijani
family of five who were burned to death. The U.S. Armenian National
Committee denied this in a statement released Monday.
   It alleged that the reports were ``fabricated'' by the
Azerinform news agency.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS that papers were filed in court in response to Trump
move to enforce contract; picks up 5th graf pvs, `This contract ...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Ivana Trump filed papers Monday
demanding that their client receive half of her estranged husband's
fortune, which they estimated at $5 billion.
   The lawyers said they had filed papers in state court in
Manhattan in which they said Mrs. Trump had no intention of seeking
a divorce and had never waived the right to an ``equitable share''
of the money Trump made during their 13-year marriage.
   ``Marital property is property gained by the husband and wife
during marriage regardless of in whose name it is held,'' said
Michael Kennedy, lawyer for Mrs. Trump.
   Trump did not have any immediate response.
   The papers were filed in response to an attempt by Trump's
lawyers to enforce a post-marital contract, signed Christmas Eve
1987. That contact, Kennedy said, ``does not waive or release Mrs.
Trump's right to such marital property.''
   ``This contract was unfair at the time it was made and is
unconscionable now that Mr. Trump is trying to enforce it,'' he
said.
   Kennedy denied reports that the contract called for Mrs. Trump
to receive $25 million in the event that their marriage broke up.
   In fact, he said, under the contract Mrs. Trump is to receive
$10 million in cash, the couple's house in Greenwich, Conn., and an
additional $4 million if she and the couple's three children move
out of Trump Tower.
   This, Kennedy said, was less than 1 percent of Trump's assets.
   The Trumps' marital problems came to light last month when the
developer left his wife, setting off much speculation about Trump's
relationships with other women.

<HEAD>Moslems Prepare for Holy Month of Fasting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslems across the world scanned the
skies after twilight Monday in hopes of sighting the luminous
crescent moon that heralds the festive but arduous dawn-to-dusk
fasting month of Ramadan.
   First to announce the sighting from the Arabian Peninsula was
North Yemen, where a panel of Islamic judges declared Ramadan will
start Tuesday. Sightings also were reported in South Yemen and
Saudi Arabia, who declared Tuesday the start of the Moslem holy
month.
   Many of the world's Islamic nations automatically follow the
Saudi decision because the kingdom harbors Islam's holiest shrines.
   Ramadan is venerated by the world's estimated 1 billion Moslems
as the month during which the archangel Gabriel imparted the verses
of the Koran to Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, more than 14
centuries ago. It is the 9th month in the Moslem lunar calendar.
   For the 30 days of Ramadan, Moslems must abstain from eating,
drinking, and smoking from dawn to sunset. They are to avoid
pleasures of the flesh. Even an innocent kiss can be a violation.
The more devout will even avoid swallowing their own saliva.
   Only Moslems who are traveling, ill, or pregnant during Ramadan
are exempt from the fast, according to the Koran. But they must
make up for this in subsequent months.
   For weeks, Moslem countries stockpiled food in preparation for
the night-time feasts that follow the days of deprivation. Some
scholars accuse Moslems of turning Ramadan into a month of feasting
rather than fasting, especially since many people actually gain
weight.
   Moslems, however, say they achieve ``boundless spiritual gains''
during Ramadan, purifying their souls and giving themselves peace
of mind.
   Tradition has it that the fast starts each day when a black
thread can be distinguished from a white one, and it ends when the
two cannot be distinguished. Large cities often fire off a cannon
to tell citizens when to stop and start eating.
   The Koran, the holy book of Islam, prescribed fasting as one of
the five pillars of the faith. The others are to recognize the
unitarian nature of Allah and that Mohammed is his prophet, pray
five times a day, give alms and make the pilgrimage to Mecca at
least once.
   The pillars are supposedly the primary factor that unite
Moslems. But the fast has been manipulated by dissident factions
and secular states to demonstrate divergent brands and practices of
the same religion.
   It is generally said that when the crescent is sighted in one
Moslem country with the naked eye, other Moslems everywhere in the
world are required to observe the start of the fast.
   However, Shiite Moslem Iran, along with Shiite communities in
countries ruled by Sunni Moslems, mark the start and end of Ramadan
ahead or behind the Sunnis, never on the same day.
   Turkey, with a secular constitution, has announced that Ramadan
commences Wednesday, under simple calendar count.
   Interior ministries along the Persian Gulf told non-Moslem
citizens and expatriate workers to avoid eating, drinking and
smoking in public during Ramadan.
   Moslems who eat, drink or smoke publicly will be fine, flogged
and imprisoned, the ministries warned.
   Liquor is strictly banned during Ramadan, and hotels are
instructed to keep their restaurants shut between sunrise and
sundown. Room service for foreigners, however, is permitted in most
countries.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Slowest in 7 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising mortgage interest rates last month
curbed demand for existing homes, causing sales to drop 2.3 percent
to their slowest pace in seven months, a real estate trade group
said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes dipped to 3.44 million units at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate as mortgage interest rates remained in the
double digits.
   John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist, said
Wednesday's Commerce Department report on sales of new homes in
February also will show a decline.
   But Tuccillo predicted rates will begin to drop in the months
ahead and renew buyer interest.
   Fixed-rate mortgages had risen from 10.17 percent to 10.31
percent last month, according to national surveys by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp., but slipped to 10.26 percent by last
Friday.
   The February sales rate was the lowest since a 3.38 million-unit
pace last July and matched a 3.44 million rate in August. Existing
homes, which represent about 80 percent of home sales, posted a
sales rate of 3.52 million units in January.
   Norman D. Flynn, the Realtors' president, said the February pace
``shows considerable market strength and sets the tone for a
healthy sales year.'' Tuccillo agreed, saying the trade group
expects existing-home sales to total 3.44 million units this year,
down 0.1 percent from 1989.
   As a result of higher mortgage rates, Flynn said many buyers
selected less expensive homes as their purchasing power slipped,
resulting in a $900 drop from the January median price of a home to
$95,400 in February.
   The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Sales declined 1.1 percent to 930,000 units in the Midwest,
where the median price for a home was $73,800. Sales also fell in
the South, down 6.4 percent to 1.3 million units, where the median
price totaled $85,600.
   Sales were up 14 percent to 650,000 units in the West and were
unchanged at 560,000 units in the Northeast. The median price for a
home in the West was $143,000 and, in the Northwest, $143,400.

   Democratic Sen. John Glenn on Monday accused
the Bush administration of failing to provide any estimate of the
number of uniformed men and women who will comprise the nation's
future armed forces.
   ``None of the defense officials who have testified before us
thus far have been able to give us any definitive manpower strength
figures beyond fiscal 1991,'' said Glenn, the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services subcommittee on manpower and personnel, in a
speech on the Senate floor.
   The Ohio Democrat also stressed the need for a review of the
armed forces, saying he believes that the allocation of roles and
missions between active and reserve units has deteriorated.
   ``The sad fact is that the Army cannot sustain a conventional
war for any length of time because the combat support and combat
service support forces that must roll in as early as 10 to 30 days
after a shooting war starts are not rated as combat ready,'' Glenn
said.
   ``War games make this very point.''
   The Ohio senator said that with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact
as a military alliance, there is a greater need for ``more
definition of our required level of combat capability.''
   But the administraton's decisions appear to be driven by fiscal
concerns rather than force structure decisions, he said.

<HEAD>Memo on Taxes Introduced in Keating Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aides to millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
ordered Lincoln Savings and Loan Association to advance its holding
company $14.2 million for taxes in 1986, a federal judge was told
Monday.
   However, the government alleges that the money, requested a
month before it was due, never was paid to the Internal Revenue
Service.
   The contention came in the 13th day of a hearing in U.S.
District Court on Keating's lawsuit, which alleges that the
government takeover of the Irvine, Calif., S&amp;L was capricious and
arbitrary. He wants the thrift returned to him.
   A June 30, 1986, memo containing the instructions was introduced
to support government allegations that Keating was illegally
siphoning federally insured deposits from the thrift.
   Regulators say the subsequent collapse of the $5.5 billion
thrift could cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion, making it the
most expensive S&amp;L failure in history.
   In the memo, Lincoln's chief financial officer was instructed by
her counterpart at the thrift's holding company _ Keating's
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix _ to make the $14,186,000
payment a month earlier than it was due.
   Government lawyer James Murphy said the memo bolsters
regulators' contention that Lincoln was using complicated real
estate, stock and junk bond transactions to book phony profits to
bolster Keating's faltering real estate empire.
   In its April takeover of the thrift, the government contended
that American Continental looted Lincoln of $94 million through the
tax-sharing arrangement. Under the agreement, the holding company
collected taxes due on the phony profits but never paid them to the
IRS, the government contends.
   Although an outline of the tax-sharing arrangement had been
approved by regulators on the West Coast, government attorneys
contend it was illegal.
   Meanwhile, Andre Niebling, Lincoln's chairman from mid-1985
through mid-1987, has refused to testify, citing a Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination.
   Niebling said in an affidavit that a federal grand jury in Los
Angeles is weighing possible criminal charges against Keating and
other American Continental and Lincoln officials.
   Mark Sauter, Lincoln's general counsel, refused earlier to
testify.
   Government lawyers alleged Monday that during a July 1986
meeting with federal regulators Keating cited an upcoming meeting
with Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the powerful chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Keating's top aide, American Continental President Judith
Wischer, testified that she could not recall Keating making that
remark or referring to Dingell.
   Keating would not comment to reporters on what he said at the
meeting. He said he did meet with Dingel later to voice complaints
about regulators, but did not discuss Lincoln's particular problems.
   Keating said he had met with about 50 members of Congress since
1984 to complain about the way then-chairmen Edwin Gray, and Gray's
successor, M. Danny Wall, were running the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, the thrift industry's chief regulator.
   Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Dingell, confirmed that
Dingell and Keating met in late July 1986.
   ``He (Keating) wanted Dingell to go after Gray and Dingell
refused,'' Fitzgibbons said.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating five senators'
intervention with bank board officials in 1987 on Lincoln's behalf.
The senators, who together received $1.3 million in political funds
from Keating, have denied any ethics violations.
   They are Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich.

<HEAD>94 Percent of Business Leaders Oppose National Health Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of the nation's
business leaders oppose a government-run national health plan,
according to a poll released Monday by the Health Insurance
Association of America.
   The poll, conducted by the Roper Organization Inc., found that
94 percent of the business executives surveyed would reject a
health-care system with a budget controlled by the states or the
federal government.
   A majority of the executives, 62 percent, said they favored
improving private-sector efforts to control health-care costs and
relying on the current level of government regulation, while 31
percent said they would favor more government regulation to control
physician and hospital prices.
   Two-thirds of the executives said that in the last year their
corporate health care costs rose by 11 percent to 20 percent; one
in six said their costs were up 21 percent to 30 percent.
   The poll also found that nine of 10 business leaders have made
major changes in their health plans over the last two to three
years to contain costs.
   The most popular option, chosen by three-quarters of them, was
to shift more of the cost to employees by increasing deductibles
and co-payments and the workers' share of premiums. Also, 62
percent said they have adopted managed care programs, such as those
based on health maintenance organizations and referred provider
organizations.
   Asked to comment on various solutions to the problems in the
health-care system, 85 percent said costs could be saved by
reducing unnecessary services through utilization reviews and
increasing physician and hospital efficiency by applying standards
for good medical practice.
   The survey was based on 100 interviews conducted in January

<TEXT>
   Gunbattles flared in Beirut's Christian
sector Monday after night-long artillery and tank fire duels in the
hinterland northeast of the capital. Police said four people were
killed and 14 wounded.
   That raised the overall toll to 772 killed and 2,143 wounded
since Jan. 30, when army Gen. Michel Aoun moved to crush Christian
warlord Samir Geagea's Lebanese forces militia.
   It was the third straight day of violations of a March 3
cease-fire, sharpening fears of a new round of full-scale fighting
to resolve the inconclusive power struggle for control of Lebanon's
Christian enclave.
   Police reported Aoun's troops and Geagea's militiamen were
engaged in battles on the streets of east Beirut's residential
district of Sin el-Fil, the industrial Dora neighborhood and a
cluster of abandoned government compounds in Badaro.
   ``They are shooting at each other with machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades, but neither side seems trying to push
for territorial gains thus far,'' said a police spokesman at
midday. He cannot be named under standing rules.
   Both sides also traded sniper fire across the coastal highway
tunnel on the Dog River boundary between Aoun's positions in the
Metn province and Geagea's lines in Kesrouan region, the spokesman
said.
   Ten of the wounded were hit by sniper fire on the Dog River
crossing.
   He said Lebanon's main power-generating plant in
militia-controlled Zouk just north of the river took several direct
hits in the nighttime shelling.
   The plant has been out of order since the first day of the
confrontation, the worst intra-Christian fighting since the civil
war with Moslems broke out 15 years ago.
   That left the Lebanese capital and its environs without city
power or water for nearly two months. Officials of the state-run
electricity authority have said repair works on the Zouk plant
would take at least five months.
   The police spokesman said Lebanese Forces gunners retaliated for
the Zouk bombardment by shelling a makeshift harbor that Aoun's
troops reportedly set up in Antelias, five miles north of Beirut.
   Geagea's militia captured Beirut port in the early days of the
showdown, stripping Aoun of the only facility to get replenishments
of arms and ammunition for his army by sea. The general has no
airport and all overland inlets to his enclave are blocked by
hostile Syrian troops.
   Military sources close to Aoun, speaking on condition of
anmonymity, said his engineering corps turned the Golden Beach
Hotel in Antelias into a tiny shipping harbor three weeks ago.
   Ships have since unloaded consignments of 155mm howitzer shells
and 120mm mortar rounds from Iraq and France for Aoun's army, the
sources said.
   Police said they could verify neither the reports.
   Aoun set up his command at the bunker of the Baabda palace after
he declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive out Syrian
peacekeeping troops from Lebanon on March 14, 1989, charging they
had become an ``occupation army.''
   The general has refused to turn over the traditional seat of
power to Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi, who was elected by
parliament Nov. 24 to fill a 13-month presidential vacuum.
   Hrawi promptly fired Aoun as army commander and prime minister
of an interim three-man military cabinet appointed by former
President Amin Gemayel when his term expired Sept. 22, 1988 with
parliament unable to elect a successor.
   Hrawi's Defense Minister Albert Mansour said in a statement
published Monday that 1,090 troops and 76 officers of various ranks
have defected from Aoun's 20,000-strong army to Hrawi's government
in Moslem west Beirut. Aoun's command declined to comment.
   Aoun's treasury, meanwhile, was declared empty by his finance
minister, Brig. Gen. Edgar Maalouf.
   He said in a statement published by several Beirut newspapers
that Aoun's cabinet was unable to pay the salaries of civil
servants or teachers at state-run schools in the Christian enclave
for March and April.

   There was broccoli, broccoli everywhere Monday
at the White House _ broccoli on the lawn, broccoli in the
boutonnieres, broccoli in the bouquet in Barbara Bush's hand.
   Everywhere, that is, except on President Bush's plate.
   And that apparently is how it will stand given the president's
adamancy against the vegetable his wife and mother forced him to
eat for decades.
   The broccoli lobby rode the wave of publicity right onto the
White House lawn, where hundreds of reporters turned out to watch
the broccoli-boosting first lady accept three boxes of the
vegetable and a bouquet.
   That was just the edge of a 10,000-pound avalanche of broccoli
California growers shipped east to donate to soup kitchens and
shelters in the nation's capital in a riposte to the president's
predilections.
   ``We appreciate the fact that the president himself does not
like broccoli personally,'' said George Dunlop, president of the
United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.
   But Dunlop, sporting a broccoli boutonniere, offered Mrs. Bush
``some very good new recipes ... (that) just might intrigue the
president to take the plunge into the wonderful world of fresh
broccoli.''
   ``I'm going to overlook the fact you think my cooking is not up
to par,'' cracked Mrs. Bush. ``But I'm going to tell you the honest
truth: The president is never going to eat broccoli.
   ``But I am never going to eat pork rinds, ever,'' she promised.
   In a vive-la-difference aside, she added, ``That's why you
stayed married 45 years.''
   Later, at a separate White House reception for florists, Mrs.
Bush confided that her daughter and four daughters-in-law ``have
all checked in and said, `Mother! What are we going to say to the
kids now?'''
   But, as she told the broccoli growers, ``if his own blessed
mother can't make him eat broccoli, then I give up.''
   ``Millie and I thank you for the broccoli. We'll eat it,'' said
Mrs. Bush, whose dog stretched beside the three cases of Irish
Spring broccoli, bursting over a small table.
   Mrs. Bush also said it was ``marvelous'' the needy in the
nation's capital were getting tons of free broccoli.
   Trying to evoke guilt in the media horde, she said, ``You
probably wouldn't have come if we'd come out to talk about the food
bank.''
   The industry had said earlier it was bringing 10 tons of
broccoli. At the event, they halved the estimate.
   Bush set the wheels in motion for the protest when it became
known that he had ordered stewards aboard Air Force One to stop
serving him broccoli.
   The president, in words a picky child could only envy, told a
news conference last Thursday: ``I do not like broccoli and I
haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat
it and I'm president of the United States and I'm not going to eat
any more broccoli.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's daughter wants to go
before a mediator next month to see whether she and her estranged
husband can agree on the terms of a divorce without waging a court
fight.
   Dorothy Bush LeBlond of Cape Elizabeth, who filed for divorce
from William LeBlond on Jan. 3, filed papers in Superior Court here
asking to go before the mediator on April 17.
   A mediation session had not yet been set by Monday, court
officials said, although William LeBlond's attorney is also
prepared to appear in the April 17 closed-doors session.
   ``It's a way to get a neutral party involved,'' attorney Thomas
H. Allen of Portland said Monday. ``There are financial issues and
issues related to children.''
   Asked whether he thinks the LeBlonds can reach agreement with a
mediator, Allen said, ``I don't make predictions, and I don't have
any comment on the matter itself.''
   Mrs. LeBlond's lawyer, Phyllis G. Givertz, of Portland, was out
of her office Monday, a secretary said.
   Mrs. LeBlond's divorce petition said ``there are irreconcilable
marital differences between the parties and the marriage has broken
down,'' without mentioning any specifics.
   The couple has two children: Samuel, 5, and Nancy, 3.

   A florists' society gave Barbara Bush a
crystal rose and inducted her into the American Academy of
Floriculture on Monday, even though the first lady confessed that
nowadays ``I just weed.''
   Mrs. Bush, speaking at a reception for the Society of American
Florists, said White House florists ``make life a joy for all of us
and ... for the 90,000 tourists that come through this house every
month.''
   ``I was supposed to tell you what an avid gardener I am, but
somehow or other I don't think you'd buy it if I told you that I'm
out there digging in the garden because I'm not,'' she admitted.
   Mrs. Bush does do some digging outside her summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, but even there ``I have someone who puts the
garden in for me because I'm not there enough. So I just weed, and
plot and plan.''
   The White House has four in-hourse florists. National Park
Service gardeners tend the Rose Garden and other outdoor flora.
   She said her late mother, Pauline Robinson Pierce, once
conservation chairman of the Garden Clubs of America, must be
``spinning at this moment.''
   ``My poor mother, she knew I hated gardening when I was young,
and now I love it so,'' said Mrs. Bush. ``I know she is looking and
saying, `This is not true! This is not happening!'''
   The State Room was bedecked with flowers for the reception, with
a centerpiece of roses.

   Jesse Jackson threatened to take the case for
District of Columbia statehood to the United Nations, but in the
meantime Monday urged the city council to provide for electing
``shadow'' members of Congress.
   ``It would be a last resort,'' Jackson said of appealing to the
U.N.
   ``If the citizens of Prague or Warsaw or Managua or Moscow were
excluded from participation in national government and denied
self-determination, we would understand that basic human rights
were being violated,'' Jackson said. ``The political occupation ...
of the people living in the District of Columbia is a cause for
global concern and action.''
   The city council, which was scheduled to vote Tuesday on a bill
that would set terms of office of the ``shadow'' delegation, has
three times postponed a similar vote in the past.
   ``The first step for statehood is to get the election on the
ballot for this year,'' Jackson said at a District Building news
conference. ``We are the cradle of democracy, but have no voting
rights in Congress. It is immoral and unjust.''
   City voters approved the ``shadow'' plan in a 1980 referendum.
The scheme, first used by the Tennessee territory in 1796, creates
the position of two `'shadow'' senators and a `'shadow''
congressman to lobby national lawmakers for statehood. The
non-voting representatives would have no other official duties.
   Jackson predicted that the council will approve the measure,
although the version of the legislation that will be voted on
tomorrow contains no funding for the posts.
   An initial draft of the bill included $1.3 million to staff the
positions and rent office space, but the measure was dismissed as
too costly and impractical for a time when the council is
struggling to avoid a deficit.

<TEXT>
   Government doctors and medical
workers went on strike Monday to protest pay cuts following of an
eight-year wage freeze, and riot police arrested about 100
university teachers who threatened to join the work stoppage.
   Armed troops patrolled the capital and other potential trouble
spots where demonstrators protested violently last month against
this West African nation's austerity measures, which include
reducing salaries by up to 17 percent.
   The austerity measures were brought on by a sharp drop in the
prices of cocoa, the Ivory Coast's top export.
   Only emergency services were available at Abidjan's main
hospital in suburban Treichville. In addition to doctors, the
strikers included pharmacists, dentists and veterinarians.
   The university lecturers were arrested when they tried to hold a
union meeting at Abidjan University despite a new ban on meetings
and protests. Union leader Marcel Ette said they were to decide
whether they would join striking health workers.
   More than 360 members of the National Union of Senior Health
Officers met in Treichville on Monday in defiance of the ban.
   The medical union had called for its 750 members across the
country to strike Monday and Tuesday to protest the cuts, imposed
this month in a government bid to avoid bankruptcy in this
financially strapped nation.
   Dr. Assoa Adou, the medical union's secretary-general, said any
pay cut on top of a wage freeze already in effect was
``insupportable and unjust.''
   A union letter blamed the government of President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny for the economic crisis, brought on by the
slumping cocoa prices overseas.
   ``The economic situation actually is the result of bad
management of public finances, embezzlement, etc.,'' the letter
said.
   Last month, the economic problems prompted widespread protests
led by university students who accused government leaders of
siphoning money from state coffers.
   Protesters set cars aflame, looted stores and stoned cars and
buses. They demanded the resignation of Houphouet-Boigny, who has
ruled Ivory Coast as a one-party state since its independence from
France in 1960.
   The government then closed the nation's only university and all
schools, leaving protest leaders without a meeting place.
   In response to the medical workers' strike, state radio Monday
said, ``All demonstrations in and around hospital premises are
forbidden, as are all demonstrations and any meetings anywhere in
the country. Security forces have been given orders to enforce
this.''
   Interior Minister Leon Konan Koffi tried to uphold the ban. He
went to Treichville University Hospital Center, which was guarded
by three truckloads of armed troops, and ordered striking health
officers to leave the building.
   ``We told him they would have to use force to move us and that
if they did, the strike will continue beyond Tuesday,'' Adou said
in an interview.
   He said the strikers planned to meet again at the hospital
Tuesday.
   The union letter warned ``the work stoppage will be total and
unlimited if a health professional is the objective of measures of
oppression, arrest or suppression of salary.''
   Adou sent a letter to Houphouet-Boigny complaining about
conditions in ill-equipped hospitals where patients have to buy
everything, even gloves for the surgeon.
   ``Many die because it takes a day or two to get together money
for the medical prescriptions ... doctors stand by powerless and
watch innocent and unjustified deaths,'' his letter said.

   Protests from animal activists led
the Seminole Tribe to cancel its planned big-game hunt at a 3-mile
preserve, so tourists will now shoot deer and antelope with cameras
instead of guns.
   Seminole officials have decided to offer safari-style excursions
for photographers on the fenced preserve they had stocked with the
animals sheep and had planned to open for hunters.
   The tribe dropped the hunting plan after animal-rights groups
complained and threatened a boycott of the Seminole-run bingo games
and cigarette shops that help finance education and social programs
for the tribe.
   ``We decided it would be more fun to watch them instead of
shooting them'' on the preserve on the Big Cypress reservation 65
miles west of Fort Lauderdale, said David Holloway, exotic-game
manager for the Seminole Tribe. The tribe paid $30,000 for 68 deer,
antelope and sheep and planned to either raise them for food or
game on the preserve.
   In about two months, Seminole guides will begin leading groups
of shutterbugs in search of the black buck antelope, axis deer,
Corsican sheep, and an African antelope called the scimitar-horned
oryx, Holloway said.
   Plans call for using buses, motorized buggies or other vehicles
to transport photo enthusiasts. The more hardy may set out on foot
through the brush in search of their quarry.
   ``I'm glad they have taken a more human approach to the animals.
We feel that's the best thing to do with the animals now that they
are here,'' said Marian Lentz, Animal Rights Foundation co-founder.
``They may as well let them live out the rest of their days in as
peaceful a way as possible.''
   The foundation, based in Pembroke Pines, was among the groups
opposed to plans for hunting parties.
   ``It's ridiculous to have hunters converge on the animals in a
small area. It's like shooting fish in a barrel,'' Lentz said.
   About 800 feet of fence was cut at the preserve in January, but
none of the animals escaped. Holloway said the animals have
established their own territories inside the preserve and would be
reluctant to leave. One sheep wandered outside the fence, but was
led back in by workers at the preserve, Holloway said.
   Members of a group calling itself the Animal Liberation Front
claimed responsibility for cutting the fence and promised to strike
again.
   Holloway said the tribe was surprised at the intensity of
opposition, especially since he said there are about 80 such game
preserves in Florida.
   ``The Indians have great respect for animals,'' he said.
``Everyone made them to be the bad guys, but it's OK for the whites
to have game farms.''
   Holloway said he was uncertain how much the tribe will charge
for the excursions.

<TEXT>
   A conservative party and a center-left
rival emerged Monday as the front-runners in Hungary's first
democratic parliamentary elections in 43 years.
   The Socialist party, which ruled as the Communist Party until it
changed its name last year, initiated the dramatic reforms that led
to Sunday's balloting but got little credit from voters. It trailed
in fourth place.
   As election results trickled in Monday, the conservative
Hungarian Democratic Forum had an edge over the center-left League
of Free Democrats.
   But neither garnered anything close to the absolute majority
needed for decisive victory, making a coalition government likely
after runoff elections are held next month.
   Election officials said only five of the 394 parliamentary seats
had been decided by Monday, and three were Hungarian Democratic
Forum winners.
   More than 70 percent of Hungary's 7.85 million eligible voters
cast ballots.
   With 3,608,000 _ 69 percent _ of the votes counted late Monday,
the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum led with 24.22 percent
and the center-left League of Free Democrats was second with 20.84
percent, state radio said.
   The Independent Smallholders, a revived pre-World War II party
popular in rural areas, had 12.62 percent, the Socialists 10.54
percent, the radical liberal League of Young Democrats 8.57 percent
and the Christian Democratic People's Party 6.43 percent.
   The rest of the 29 parties that fielded candidates appeared to
fall short of winning 4 percent of the vote nationwide and
therefore would not be entitled to any Parliament seats.
   Up to 14 candidates competed in most races, and the vote was so
split that many seats will have to be contested again, election
officials said. In the second round of voting, a simple majority
will suffice, provided 25 percent of eligible voters turn out.
   The Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats have said they do
not want to govern together, so the Smallholders may be the key to
forming a coalition.
   Smallholder leader Vince Voeroes said Monday his party is
ideologically closer to the Forum, which like the Smallholders is
based on traditional, Christian values and in the prewar populism
of rural Hungary. But he said no decision had been made on whether
to ally with the Forum.
   Democratic Forum chairman Joszef Antall said Voeroes' party
would be his first choice as a coalition partner, and like the Free
Democrats dismissed any idea of working with the Socialists.
   ``There will be no place whatsoever in the new government for
members of the old government, ministers of state and deputy
ministers,'' he said.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth, a founder of the Socialist Party and one
of the chief supporters of full democracy, said his outgoing
government should get credit for leading the nation to Sunday's
historic vote ``under extremely complex conditions.''
   Nemeth, running as an independent in his home village of
Szerencs, 70 miles northeast of Budapest, was one of the few
candidates to win outright.
   The Socialists and their Communist predecessors played a role
unique in the Soviet bloc by initiating reform rather than being
forced into it.
   But most voters apparently associated the Socialists with the
repression of Hungary's Communist rule and rejected the party's
candidates.

   Minor aftershocks rattled Costa Rica
on Monday following two earthquakes last weekend that destroyed 30
homes near a Pacific port, damaged several schools and slightly
injured 10 people, officials said.
   Sunday's quakes measured 5.5 and 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   Sources in the Red Cross and National Emergency Commission said
about 10 people were injured in the coastal region closest to the
epicenter of Sunday morning's tremors, though none was seriously
enough hurt to require hospitalization.
   The quakes Sunday were centered in the Pacific Ocean, 80 miles
southwest of San Jose, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo.
   Thirty houses were destroyed in the area of the Pacific port of
Puntarenas. Several schools, a Catholic church and a hospital in
the area were closed until earthquake damage is repaired,
commission sources said.
   The Volcanic and Seismological Center said Monday at least 700
aftershocks had been recorded, the strongest occurring before dawn
Monday and measuring 4.2.
   Sunday's quakes also cracked the cupola of the cathedral in
Alajuela, 12 miles north of San Jose, caused long fissures in the
sides of many buildings and caused landslides that blocked the main
highway linking San Jose with the Atlantic coast.

   Jury selection began under tight security
Monday for a man believed to be a high-ranking member of the
Medellin drug cartel.
   Jose Rafael Abello-Silva of Santa Marta, Colombia, is charged
with two counts of conspiring to import drugs. He was extradited
Oct. 29 from Bogota to Tulsa, where he was indicted in 1987 on drug
charges.
   Abello was extradited under a decree signed in 1989 by Colombian
President Virgilio Barco Vargas that provides for extradition of
suspected narcotics traffickers.
   Security was tight in the courthouse where 100 prospective
jurors assembled. Metal detectors were set up outside the courtroom.
   U.S. Attorney Tony Graham had asked that the juror's names,
addresses and employers not be made public and U.S. District Judge
Thomas Brett agreed.
   ``It should not cause you to treat this case any differently
from other criminal cases,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys have asked that the trial be moved out of
Tulsa because of publicity. Brett said he would rule on the motion
after talking to prospective jurors.
   Abello, 35, was arrested Oct. 10 in a Bogota restaurant. Police
said he had undergone plastic surgery to avoid detection.
   
   He was indicted by a federal grand jury in Tulsa on Sept. 2,
1987, along with Florida stock broker Frank Palmero. Palmero later
was convicted on drug distribution charges and sentenced to 16
years in prison.
   The indictment accuses Abello of involvement in a conspiracy to
ship more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine and 6,200 pounds of
marijuana to the United States.

   A federal magistrate Monday ordered
psychiatric tests for a man accused of stealing $10 million to $20
million in rare books from collections across the country.
   An FBI agent, meanwhile, said investigators have begun to match
books found in the Ottumwa home of Stephen Carrie Blumberg with
books that libraries reported missing or stolen.
   ``We believe we'll be able to help out several of these
libraries,'' said Special Agent Dennis Aiken of the Omaha, Neb.,
bureau.
   Blumberg, 41, of St. Paul, Minn., was arrested last week at a
home he owns in Ottumwa. The FBI said it found 11,000 rare books as
well as antiques in the 14-room house.
   Defense attorneys and prosecutors agreed to the examination
during a hearing before Magistrate Ronald Longstaff. The hearing
originally was set to determine conditions Blumberg would have to
meet in order to be freed before trial. No trial date has been set.
   Blumberg did not speak during the appearance. He was returned to
the Polk County jail.
   Blumberg will be sent later this week to the Springfield Medical
Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Mo. The examination is
to last a month.
   Blumberg's lawyer, Don Nickerson of Des Moines, said the
agreement for psychiatric evaluation does not necessarily mean
Blumberg will use mental condition as a defense.
   Nickerson said he would have little trouble arranging a pretrial
bond after the examination. ``If he's released, what's the danger,
that he'll throw books at passing cars?'' Nickerson argued.
   Government lawyer Linda Read declined to comment on what the
government has found, saying prosecutors were examining the
collection.
   Many of the identifying marks or labels were removed from the
books. But Aiken said finding the owners shouldn't be difficult
because the books are rare. Some of the books may have to be held
as evidence.
   Aiken would not say how investigators closed in on Blumberg.

   John Poindexter's lawyers lost efforts Monday
to get the testimony of former hostage David Jacobsen and a House
staff member who made political comments about a possible Contra
investigation.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said testimony at
Poindexter's trial by Jacobsen, who was held in West Beirut from
May 1985 to Nov. 2, 1986, would ``inflame'' the jury with the
emotional hostage issue.
   Greene also granted a House motion to quash Poindexter's
subpoena for House staff member Victor Johnson, who had said in a
1986 memo that inquiring into Oliver North's Contra-related
activities would make a good political issue.
   Meanwhile, Poindexter's lawyers disclosed that they plan to call
Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., as a character witness for Poindexter.
   Poindexter, a retired rear admiral, served under Chafee when the
senator was secretary of the Navy in the Nixon administration.
Chafee will testify Tuesday, his office confirmed.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing from Congress the U.S. role
in a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran and North's military
assistance to the Contras.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler said he wanted Jacobsen to
testify about a conversation with Poindexter, which occurred on
Nov. 21, 1986. That is the day Poindexter is accused of obstructing
Congress and making false statements about the Iran initiative.
   Beckler said Jacobsen could testify about conveying to
Poindexter serious concern that any inaccurate information about
the Iran initiative could result in harm to the hostages.
   As for the House staff member, Johnson had said in a memo to
Rep. Ronald Coleman, D-Texas, that delving into North's Contra
activities ``places the administration in a coverup posture.''
Coleman introduced a resolution of inquiry into North's activities.
   Greene said whether there was ``political motivation'' for the
resolution of inquiry is irrelevant to the criminal case against
the former national security adviser.
   In testimony earlier Monday, a former National Security Council
employee said Poindexter told then-President Reagan the U.S.
government had no connection to a Contra resupply plane that
crashed in Nicaragua.
   Poindexter made the statement to Reagan on Oct. 7, 1986, two
days after the plane carrying ammunition was shot down and one of
its crewmen, Eugene Hasenfus, was captured, Rodney McDaniel
testified.
   Actually, the Hasenfus flight was part of the network overseen
by North to keep the Contras armed during a congressional ban on
U.S. military aid to the rebel force.
   The Iran initiative resulted in the release of three hostages _
Jacobsen, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco
_ though three other U.S. citizens were seized in Lebanon during
the period of the releases in 1985 and 1986.

<HEAD>Videotape Distributer Files Complaint Against Justice Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A distributor of sexually oriented videotapes
accused the Justice Department on Monday of abusing its powers by
trying to force the company to choose between prosecution or going
out of business.
   PHE Inc., which does business as Adam &amp; Eve, contends that the
Justice Department was trying to force it to stop distributing
``sexually oriented expressive material'' that officials have
acknowledged is not legally obscene.
   Justice Department officials ``have abused their prosecutorial
powers in a deliberate effort to coerce plaintiffs to cease
distribution of expressive materials defendants could not, and
would not, prosecute as obscene,'' said the complaint filed in U.S.
District Court here.
   The officials ``have varied the threats and pressures they have
brought to bear on plaintiffs in order to coerce the
self-censorship of as broad a range of non-obscene expressive
materials as plaintiffs can be coerced to forego.''
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction to bar the government's National
Obscenity Enforcement Unit from bringing federal charges for
distributing books and videotapes.
   The suit also seeks a court order barring the Justice Department
from threatening to bring ``simultaneous multiple prosecutions''
around the country unless the company agrees to stop distributing
the books and videotapes.
   The lawsuit notes that in 1987 a state-court jury in North
Carolina acquitted the company and owner Philip D. Harvey of felony
obscenity charges.
   The company has been threatened with federal prosecution in
North Carolina, Utah and Kentucky.
   Harvey said in a statement that the government ``is clearly
targeting us as part of a political persecution campaign intended
to pacify a tiny minority of intolerant right-wing extremists.''
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett declined to comment on
the lawsuit.
   The action was filed a day before Karl Brussel and his Pak
Ventures Inc. were set to go to trial in nearby Alexandria, Va., on
federal obscenity distribution charges.
   Brussel faces similar federal charges in North Carolina and in
two different federal jurisdictions in Alabama.
   The charges have drawn criticism from free-speech advocates who
have accused the Justice Department of trying to bludgeon
mail-order companies into going out of business rather than pay
high legal bills.
   In 1988, a federal judge barred the Justice Department from
prosecuting mail-order operator Avram Freedburg in more than one
federal jurisdiction.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson held that such
multiple prosecutions ``cannot possibly be consistent with due
process.''
   To settle the dispute, Freedberg's company, Consumers Marketing
Group Ltd. of Stamford, Conn., agreed to plead guilty to mailing
obscene matter, pay a $600,000 fine and stop distributing sexually
oriented material.

<HEAD>Tanks Pull Back, School Reopen in Troubled Transylvanian Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIRGU MURES, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army tanks pulled back and schools
reopened Monday in this northern Translyvanian city, which has been
the scene of deadly street battles between ethnic Hungarians and
Romanians.
   Despite easing tensions, scattered small-scale incidents between
the two groups were reported in the region Monday. No casualties
were reported.
   In addition, several hundred troops and policemen remained
around Tirgu Mures, a picturesque Transylvanian town of 170,000
people.
   Authorities were trying to prevent a repeat of running street
battles last week between extremists from both communities. At
least six people were killed, and about 300 were injured, according
to an official communique.
   On Monday, 12 army T-55 tanks that had been used to block the
main square in Tirgu Mures were withdrawn.
   Classes resumed in all schools, including the Institute of
Medicine and Pharmacy, whose ethnic Hungarian students had been on
strike the past three weeks, Radio Bucharest reported.
   It said ``social and economic activities are being carried out
almost normally.''
   ``We are all willing to give it another try, so let's hope that
peace here will last,'' a Romanian high school student told The
Associated Press.
   In a statement Monday, however, the provisional committee of the
Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, an ethnic Hungarian
political party, accused Romanians of splashing paint on the statue
of a 19th century Hungarian hero.
   The statue hero stands in the Transylvanian town of Zalau, where
occupying Hungarian troops killed a group of Romanians in 1940.
   The Hungarian statement described the purported attack on the
statue as a ``profanity.''
   Romanians, who make up nearly 70 percent of Transylvania's 7.5
million people, accuse ethnic Hungarians of seeking to secede from
Romania and rejoin neighboring Hungary.
   Hungary had ruled Transylvania for centuries, although Romanians
were in the majority. However, the region was ceded to Romania in
1918 at the close of World War I.
   Ethnic Hungarians deny they want to secede. They say they only
want more cultural autonomy.
   The conflict has come to the surface in recent weeks in the
atmosphere of freer expression that has prevailed since the
December revolution ousted hard-line Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.

<TEXT>
   Two suspected Kurdish guerrillas and a
village guard were killed in a clash near the Iraqi border, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency said Monday.
   The agency said the clash took place Sunday night when a group
of Kurds attempted to raid Dogan village.
   It said the Kurdish insurgents escaped after exchanging fire
with village guards loyal to the government.
   Anatolia did not say what organization the insurgents belonged
to, but most rebels operating in the region are linked with the
outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, also known by its Kurdish initials
PKK.
   The Marxist group, with headquarters in the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa valley in Lebanon, seeks to set up an independent state in
southeastern Turkey.
   More than 2,300 people including civilians, security personnel
and rebels have died since the PKK started hit-and-run attacks six
years ago.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's 55 million
populace.

   Police on Monday clashed with
demonstrators protesting living and working conditions in two black
townships, and at least two blacks were killed, witnesses said.
   There were conflicting reports on the number of deaths in
Sharpeville and Sebokeng, townships just south of Johannesburg.
Independent 702 radio station quoted local residents as saying up
to 12 people were missing and feared dead.
   However, government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said
there were five deaths and independent South African Press
Association said two to eight were killed. Those stations did not
cite their sources, and police said a more detailed statement
wouldn't be issued until Tuesday morning.
   Also Monday, officials blamed guerrillas of the African National
Congress for attacks the night before on town offices in Soweto and
a power station in Johannesburg. The attacks came less than three
weeks before the anti-apartheid ANC is scheduled to begin
negotiations with the white-minority government.
   Police said they used birdshot, rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse several thousand demonstrators in Sharpeville and
Sebokeng, townships about six miles apart.
   In Sebokeng, the protesters stoned a police station and set fire
to the municipal buildings, police said.
   ``Police (are) coming on constant attack, mainly by
stone-throwing mobs,'' said a statement from police headquarters in
Pretoria.
   At least two blacks were killed and hundreds wounded during the
clash in Sebokeng, according to a nurse at the Sebokeng Hospital
who declined to give her name.
   Other witnesses gave similar accounts, and some said more than
300 were injured, but it was not immediately clear how the two
blacks were killed.
   Police said there was an undetermined number of injuries, but
they had no information on deaths.
   No casualties were reported in Sharpeville.
   The demonstrators were protesting rents, housing conditions and
working conditions in the townships, witnesses said.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok met with local police
officials and promised to increase staffing and patrols in the
troubled region.
   Also, police accused African National Congress guerrillas of
firing two rocket-propelled grenades Sunday night at town council
offices in Soweto, another township outside Johannesburg. The two
Soviet-made RPG-7 grenades caused damage but no injuries, police
said.
   An hour later, three mines were detonated at the Langlaagte
power station in Johannesburg, badly damaging three transformers,
police said.
   Hundreds of police and security officers on Monday searched for
those responsible for the attacks, the most serious in several
months. Police officials, who declined to be named, said they
believed the ANC's military wing mounted the attacks as ``a show of
force.''
   Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders are to meet with the
government April 11 in Cape Town to try to clear the way for talks
on ending white-minority rule in South Africa.
   President F.W. de Klerk last month freed Mandela after 27 years
of imprisonment and legalized the ANC and other black opposition
groups in a bid to bring blacks to the negotiating table.
   In Nairobi, Kenya, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa's
Anglican Church said Monday that the ANC should renounce its policy
of armed resistance.
   ``Anybody who says that they want to continue to fight when
there is a possibility to talk will find they have very few
supporters in South Africa and internationally,'' Tutu told a news
conference.
   Police reports said at least seven blacks were killed Sunday in
fighting between rival black factions in the eastern province of
Natal.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. said eight blacks were
killed and nine injured in a faction fight Sunday near Tugela
Ferry, also in Natal.
   More than 3,000 blacks have been killed since 1986 in Natal in
fighting between the ANC-aligned United Democratic Front and the
Inkatha movement.
   Recent efforts by Mandela and other black leaders to end the
violence have proved ineffective.

<HEAD>Social Club Fire: Cruel Incarnation of a Familiar Nightmare</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Social Club Fire, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire raced through a Bronx social club, snuffing
out lives in a rush of flame and toxic smoke. The mayor, horrified
at the carnage, formed a task force to close down the city's
illegal nightspots.
   That was a year and a half ago.
   Sunday, the nightmare returned in an even crueler incarnation.
Instead of six people, 87 were now dead in a crowded club. The
city's crackdown had failed. And given continued failure, experts
said Monday, many more may die.
   ``These places are fire traps. They're supermarkets of crime.
They're in violation of every code imaginable,'' said state Sen.
Jeremy Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat who led an investigation of
illegal social clubs in 1981.
   ``It's not just the city of New York, it's true for every city
in the country,'' he said in an interview. ``It's something every
urban area has had to deal with in the last decade. And none has
been dealing with it.''
   Indeed, despite a renewed crackdown announced Monday. ``It
wouldn't shock me if this happened again,'' said Charles Ryan, an
ex-fire captain and now fire science department chairman at John
Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``These places reopen as fast as
they shut 'em down.''
   The problem is not a new one. In 1942, 491 people lost their
lives at Boston's Cocoanut Grove club in the nation's worst fire
ever. Like the Happy Land Social Club, site of Sunday's fire, the
Cocoanut Grove was overcrowded at the time of the blaze and lacked
adequate exits for patrons.
   That fire led to new national fire codes for emergency exits,
lighting and other factors that could contribute to a blaze.
   Ryan and others said the simple problem is in enforcing such
laws. But it also is more complex than that, they said _ a
combination of the city's enormous problems, shrinking budget and
paralyzing bureaucracy.
   And there is another, equally daunting factor: Tremendous demand
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs, particularly in poor
immigrant communities where life is difficult, diversions are
scarce and danger is a commonplace.
   ``People who are living in tough conditions of life are going to
look for opportunities to blow off some steam,'' said Prof. William
Kornblum, director of the Social Research Center at the City
University of New York's graduate school. ``They're going to pay
less attention to the dangers around them.''
   The hazards can be legion. At the Happy Land club, authorities
say there was no open fire exit, no first-floor sprinkler system,
no proper emergency lights, and bars on the sole window.
   The only way out was through the front door. It was blocked by
flames, allegedly ignited by an arsonist. Sixty-one men and 26
women died.
   The deaths are all the more tragic for the city's failed effort
to shut down the Happy Land. The task force formed by Mayor Edward
I. Koch in 1988 won an order that year that it be closed.
Apparently it was, for a time. And at some point, unknown to the
authorities, it reopened.
   ``Most horrifying is that this should never have happened,''
said Mayor David Dinkins. ``That club had been inspected. It had
been cited. And it had been ordered closed.'' He immediately
launched another crackdown, with police posting vacate orders on
187 social clubs Sunday night.
   But those orders don't solve the problem. Said Ryan: ``Issuing a
piece of paper and saying, `You're closed' doesn't mean anything
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head.''
   With 2,031 inspections by the task force last year,
identification of illegal clubs has been adequate, Ryan said.
``It's the follow-up that's weak,'' he said. ``That's the nut of
the problem: inadequate enforcement.''
   Fuller enforcement would require substantial manpower. The
police estimate there are 1,220 social clubs in the city, with
about 1,000 listed as inactive. But Happy Land was one of those
``inactive'' clubs.
   Kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600 operating
social clubs _ some legal, many not _ with more in nearby suburbs.
   ``It is true that complete enforcement is futile. The clubs are
always moving to new locations, always trying to stay a step or two
ahead of the authorities,'' Kornblum said. But he said aggressive
followup could save lives, if the city provided the resources.
   There are other approaches as well. With a view of social clubs
as cultural centers, Kornblum suggested low-interest city loans for
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives.
   Ryan, for his part, suggested cracking down on the liquor
merchants who keep the clubs supplied, and possibly placing a legal
limit on retail liquor sales. Weinstein said he would investigate
the idea.
   Yet Weinstein noted that little of this is new. In 1981, his
panel's report on illegal social clubs included this warning: ``The
potential fire hazard alone is of such proportion that numerous
lives could be lost at any time no matter how minor the fire was at
the outset.''
   ``How ironic that after so many years, we're still back where we
started,'' he said. ``Now a lot of people are going to be up in
arms over this. And then, eventually, it's going to fade _ until it
happens again.''

   Hondurans jammed phone lines Monday
seeking news of relatives in New York City following a weekend fire
that killed 87 people at a Bronx social club.
   The government expressed regret over the death of the victims,
most of them Hondurans and Dominicans, and instructed its
ambassador to gather information for relatives.
   Gov. Dylia Chirinos de Diaz said most of the Hondurans were from
coastal towns in Colon province.
   ``The majority of them traveled to the United States in search
of a better way of life,'' said Edith Fajardo, a Honduran consular
official in New York.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro said the government
was studying the possibility of sending a Honduran air force plane
to bring back the bodies of the victims of the fire at the Happy
Land social club.
   Julio Cesar Castro of the northwestern city of San Pedro Sula
said his 17-year-old daughter, Janeta Mercedes Castro, died in the
early morning blaze.
   ``My daughter traveled to New York in search of better horizons,
to save money and then return to her home in Honduras, but she only
found death,'' he said.
   She had been in New York for two years and was a maid for an
American family, Castro said. He said she leaves a 2-year-old son
who lives with him.
   A Cuban man thrown out of the club after quarreling with his
ex-girlfriend was arraigned Monday on arson and murder charges.
   Hondurans seeking information on victims and the welfare of
relatives crowded into telephone offices in Colon province.
   Radio stations broadcast almost continual news of the fire and
said they were receiving streams of calls seeking information on
victims. Stations are a major means of communication in the
country, which has a 57 percent illiteracy rate.
   In New York, Miguel Reyes, coach of the Club Deportivo Adrana
amateur soccer team, said three of its players, all from Puerto
Cortes, a northwestern coastal town, were among the dead.
   ``They all dreamed of returning home _ but with more money,''
Reyes said.
   Reynaldo Colon Nunez, a Honduran living in New York, told the
Tegucigalpa station Radio America by telephone that he normally
would have been at the club himself.
   ``Nearly every Sunday I went to Happy Land to dance but
yesterday I didn't want to,'' he said.

   Women's groups and political opponents continued
to heap criticism Monday on Republican gubernatorial candidate
Clayton Williams, who joked at a weekend campfire that women should
``relax and enjoy'' rape.
   ``I don't care if it was made around the campfire, a living room
or a formal speech,'' state Treasurer Ann Richards said. ``It
indicates a level of thinking that is an embarrassment.''
   Richards could face Williams in the November election if she
wins a Democratic runoff against Attorney General Jim Mattox on
April 10.
   Williams, who has since apologized, told reporters on a cattle
roundup at his Alpine ranch Saturday that the bad weather they were
experiencing was a lot like rape.
   ``If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it,'' he said.
   He said he had been joking, but conceded later that the remark
was inappropriate.
   ``I feel just terrible about this. I had no intention in my
heart to hurt anyone, especially those women who have been
traumatized by rape,'' said Williams in a statement released by the
staff Sunday.
   ``Looking back, I realize it was insensitive and had no place at
the campfire or in any setting.''
   The Texas chapter of the National Organization for Women issued
a statement Monday calling the remark ``degrading'' and ``not
acceptable for someone who wishes to govern a society where all
human beings can live and function in safety.''
   Williams' campaign spokesman, Bill Kenyon, said damage to the
Williams campaign may be short-lived.
   ``We had probably 30 or so calls yesterday, that were most of
them rather harsh in tone,'' Kenyon said. ``After the apology that
Clayton put out yesterday, most of the calls today have been more
sympathetic or not the same kind of tone.''
   He said Williams' apology will work in his favor ``because
people know that Clayton Williams doesn't have a mean bone in his
body.''
   Earlier, however, Mattox called the remark in character for
Williams.
   ``It is within his character, and it is within the way he
normally deals with people and traditions and institutions,''
Mattox said Sunday.
   State GOP leaders said the controversy would be a lesson to
Williams, a millionaire rancher and businessman making his first
political race.
   ``He should not have joked about it that way,'' said state Sen.
Cyndi Krier of San Antonio.
   ``Claytie is new to public life and he's learning some lessons
along the way,'' said Beverly Kaufman, first vice president of the
Texas Federation of Republican Women.
   ``He used an archaic expression to say `Let's make the best of
an unpleasant situation,''' she said, adding she could understand
why some people would take offense.

   Winter took a late, feeble swing at New England on Monday,
depositing up to two inches of snow, and rain fell across the
flood-weary South.
   Scattered snowfall was reported in New Hampshire and Vermont,
where two inches piled up in Montpelier by noon. Snow also fell in
parts of central New York state and central Pennsylvania.
   Rain fell along a band from South Carolina through central
Texas, and many rivers in the region remained above flood stage.
   Minor flooding occurred in the Carolinas, Georgia and Texas,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Some flooding was reported Monday along Georgia's Flint,
Ocmulgee and lower Savannah rivers; North Carolina's Roanoke River;
and the Santee and Great Pee Dee rivers in South Carolina.
   Flood warnings were in effect in the Sulfur and Cypress Creek
basins in Texas, as well as along the Trinity, Sabine and Neches
rivers.
   There also was some lowland flooding in Illinois, along the
Illinois River.
   Freeze warnings were posted for Monday night through the
mid-Atlantic states, but daytime highs Tuesday were forecast in the
40s and 50s.
   Cloudy or partly cloudy skies were expected Tuesday in south and
the Plains states, with showers over coastal Georgia, Arizona, New
Mexico and west Texas. Skies over the rest of the nation were
expected to be clear.
   The low temperature for the nation Monday was 1 degree at West
Yellowstone, Mont. and Yellowstone, Wyo. Temperatures around the

<TEXT>
   Some law enforcement officials have long
doubted that Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca was a strong enough
leader to take the helm of the crime family his father had ruled
with an iron fist since Prohibition.
   But others say his low-key demeanor was deceptive.
   Patriarca, 45, inherited control of the New England mob on the
death of his father, Raymond Patriarca Sr., from a heart attack in
1984, authorities say.
   A five-year FBI investigation culminated Monday in a 113-page
indictment naming Patriarca and 20 alleged mobsters on charges
ranging from murder and racketeering to kidnapping, drug
trafficking and gambling.
   ``He was so much different than his father,'' said Providence
police Cmdr. Richard S. Tamburini, who formerly headed the city's
intelligence bureau. ``He was so low-key and very difficult to
locate. His father, on the other hand, was out in the open.
   ``A lot of people would not accept that Junior was running the
mob,'' he said. ``I think that should put this to rest.''
   But North Kingstown's police chief John Leyden, who also tracked
the mob as a Providence detective, said he suspects ``much of the
respect is for the No. 2 person, Nicky'' Bianco.
   Patriarca and his alleged underboss, Nicholas Bianco, were among
15 of the 21 brought into custody Monday afternoon.
   At a hearing before a U.S. magistrate in Providence, lawyer John
Cicilline said Patriarca was suffering from cataracts and cancer.
Patriarca was ordered transferred to Boston, where he was detained
pending an April 6 hearing.
   The Patriarca family's alleged involvement in organized-crime
activities remains strong, but its influence waned as its
membership dwindled over the last decade, both Tamburini and Leyden
said.
   The elder Patriarca became the city's ``Public Enemy Number
One'' during Prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s. By the
1970s, he had been arrested more than 40 times, convicted of 18
crimes ranging from armed robbery and conspiracy to murder, and had
served seven years in prison.
   He was identified as head of the New England La Cosa Nostra
during 1969 U.S. Senate committee hearings. According to
transcripts of conversations picked up by an illegally hidden FBI
microphone, he recruited Bianco in the early 1960s to be an
enforcer and mediator between New York gangs.
   The family operated from a vending machine company and a
cleaning business in the predominantly Italian Federal Hill
neighborhood. One resident who attended his funeral said Patriarca
``protected the Hill ... there never was any trouble on the Hill.
Now there will be trouble.''
   The FBI transcripts also revealed a father who wanted his only
son to be a lawyer or successful businessman, but who was
frustrated that the boy twice had flunked out of the University of
Rhode Island.
   Tamburini said the younger Patriarca has been deeply involved in
his father's business since at least 1980, when the crime boss ran
into serious legal and health problems.
   The ailing Patriarca was indicted in September 1981 on charges
of taking part in a scheme to skim $11 million from the Laborers'
International Union, but a federal magistrate found him too ill to
stand trial on the racketeering charges in Florida.
   Aside from investing in a delicatessen that displayed
photographs of gangsters on the walls, Raymond Junior stayed in the
background, authorities said.
   ``When his father was alive, you wouldn't see him very much,''
Leyden said. ``It was only during his father's trial that you saw
him.''
   His chief rival for control of the New England mob was Gennaro
J. Angiulo of Boston, who once was heard on an FBI tape saying of
the then 40-year-old Patriarca: ``I can't see the kid stepping into
the picture for the simple reason ... he is too young.''
   But law enforcement officials said Patriarca's hold was
strengthened when Angiulo was arrested on racketeering charges.
   Patriarca was arrested only once, in 1971 on charges of
receiving stolen bundles of fiberglass, and the charges were
dropped when two witnesses refused to testify.
   He grew up on Providence's affluent East Side, but in recent
years retreated to his home in Lincoln, R.I., where he spent much
of his time working on real-estate developments, authorities said.
   Patriarca retreated further into the background after reputed
underboss William P. Grasso was found shot last June near Hartford,
Conn., said law enforcement officials who speculated an internal
power tussle.
   ``They're in chaos now because of a lack of trust,'' Tamburini
said.

<HEAD>Murder Victims' Families Seek Donations for Counseling Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families of murder victims from across
Massachusetts gathered Monday to open the headquarters of a victims
support group named for a high school student who was stabbed to
death by Willie Horton in 1974.
   ``The ordeal my family has endured has brought us together with
other families of murder victims,'' Donna Fournier Cuomo said in
opening the Joey Fournier Victim Services' office across from the
Statehouse.
   The group provides free counseling to relatives of murder
victims and plans to lobby for legislation to change the criminal
justice system.
   Cuomo, the group's founder and executive director, was
Fournier's sister. Fournier, a 17-year-old vocational high school
student, was stabbed, stuffed in a trash can and left to die by
Horton.
   The case of Horton, who escaped while on furlough from prison
and attacked a Maryland couple, became a highly publicized issue
during the 1988 presidential campaign. Then-candidate George Bush
used it to criticize Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' record on crime.
   Joey Fournier Victim Services already offers counseling in
Lawrence in the northeastern section of the state, where Fournier
grew up, and wants to open centers in other sections of
Massachusetts.
   About 20 to 30 people attended Monday's opening, including Duane
and Phyllis Hotchkiss of Saugus, whose 19-year-old son Brian was
slain in 1989 in Lynn.
   ``I'm determined that our son's death is not going to be in
vain,'' said Hotchkiss, who donated $100 to the group. The group
needs to raise another $100,000, said Cuomo, who would not say how
much has been raised.
   Counseling ordinarily costs about $100 a session, but not
everybody can afford it and not all health insurance plans cover
it, said Cuomo.
   Cuomo's voice wavered as she read the names of victims whose
families were present.
   ``One tragic result of violent crime is the lasting effect it
has on the victim's family. I know my family will never be the
same,'' said Cuomo, who is no relation to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   In addition to offering counseling, the headquarters will serve
as the center for a coalition of victim support groups, including
Parents of Murdered Children, the Young Adult Sibling Group and
Victims for Victims.
   The Joey Fournier group has already introduced bills to repeal
the state's criminal records law, which shields criminal records
from public scrutiny.
   The organization also has submitted legislation to limit the
governor's powers to commute sentences and another measure to
require ``truth in sentencing'' so that convicted criminals will
actually serve the time of their sentence.

<HEAD>Leader of Daring Sea Rescue in World War II Dead at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cmdr. Bradwell Turner, who led a daring rescue of
299 seamen held prisoner on a German ship in 1940, has died,
according to a news report. He was 92.
   Turner died last Wednesday, an obituary published in Tuesday's
edition of the Times of London said. No cause of death was given.
   With a cry of ``The Navy's here,'' Turner led a boarding party
from the destroyer HMS Cossack, which freed the prisoners from the
German supply ship Altmark in a Norwegian fjord in February 1940.
   The Altmark had been an auxiliary vessel of the German
battleship Graf Spee. Seamen taken prisoner from merchant marine
vessels sunk by the Graf Spee were put aboard the Altmark.
   The Graf Spee was scuttled just outside Montevideo, Uruguay, in
December 1939 after being trapped by three British cruisers. Some
of the Graf Spee survivors still reside in neighboring Argentina.
   After the elimination of the Graf Spee, the Altmark, with its
prisoners, hid in the South Atlantic for two months. Then, in
February, it was sighted in Norwegian waters.
   Pursuing British ships were intercepted by two Norwegian torpedo
boats, whose commanders said the Altmark had been inspected,
carried no arms and had no prisoners on board.
   Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, ordered the
Navy to board the Altmark and release the prisoners.
   Cossack entered the fjord on the night of Feb. 16. The skipper
of the Altmark steered straight at the British ship, apparently
intending to ram it, but instead ran his own ship aground.
   Turner, then a lieutenant commander, led a boarding party
carrying pistols and rifles. Four Germans were killed and five were
wounded in the encounter.
   The rescue was an inspirational moment for the British, who had
little to show for their six months at war with Germany.
   Turner received a Distinguished Service Order in 1940 for his
part in the action. He received the Order of the British Empire in
1951.
   He served as a naval attache in Oslo, Norway from 1954 to 1957,
and worked for the Marconi electronics company from 1957 to 1972.
   He is survived by his wife and three daughters.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is proposing a
federal milk marketing order to include North Carolina and South
Carolina, officials said Monday.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said the recommendation was based on hearings
held last year. He said order would require the approval of milk
producers before it could take effect.
   Haley said the marketing order _ which would set minimum prices
bottlers would have to pay dairy farmers for their milk _ is
necessary to ensure an adequate supply of milk for consumers in the
two states.
   The primary milk consumption areas include Charlotte,
Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Raleigh, Durham, Asheville and
Fayetteville in North Carolina, and Columbia, Charleston and
Greenville in South Carolina.
   Haley said the federal marketing order would resolve milk supply
problems in these states. North Carolina regulates its milk
production under a state marketing order, and South Carolina has no
milk marketing regulations, he said.
   A federal order will match supply and demand for the entire
area, with special circumstances spelled out to deal with the uses
of milk in over-supply, and to encourage delivery of milk to
bottling plants in under-supply, Haley said.
   Federal milk marketing orders do not set retail prices paid by
consumers for milk, he said. However, the orders do affect
consumers by assuring a balance between supply and demand for milk
_ and by setting minimum prices that bottlers much pay farmers.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent by April 27 to:
Hearing Clerk, Room 1083-S, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania has opened direct telephone service with the
West, lifting some of the restrictions that have made it one of the
world's most isolated countries.
   An employee of the Albanian Telegraph Agency in Tirana,
Albania's capital, said direct telephone service between Albania
and some Western countries began March 20. The operator was reached
by direct-dial call from Rome on Monday.
   The employee, who did not give his name, said 56 countries have
direct-dial links with Albania, including the United States,
Canada, Britain and France.
   The operator said it was possible to call Albania directly from
France, Canada and Britain and vice versa. The operator said
Albanians may call the United States. When asked if calls could be
placed to Albania from the United States, the operator said, ``I
think so.''
   But attempts to do so Monday were unsuccessful, and Rich
Wallerstein of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said the service
was not yet in place.
   ``Beginning this past weekend it became possible for Albanians
to direct dial into the United States, but we do not, as yet, have
service from the United States to Albania,'' he said.
   Wallerstein said the Albanian Telegraph Agency and AT&amp;T had been
discussing establishing service for some time.
   ``The way it came to our attention was Albanians were phoning
relatives in the United States, and people in the United States
tried to phone back and couldn't get through,'' he said.
   Albania, a country of 3.2 million people, is Europe's last
bastion of Stalinist isolation. It has pursued orthodox
Marxist-Leninist policies since the Communists took over in 1944.
   But there have been increased signs of openings to the West
under President Ramiz Alia, who took over after the death of Enver
Hoxha in 1985.
   Some Western journalists have been allowed into Albania in
recent months. They reported seeing apartment houses with homemade
antennas to receive TV broadcasts from Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia.
   Alitalia, Italy's flag airline, started a weekly flight to
Albania last year. Olympic Airways, the Greek airline, also flies
to Albania.
   The Italian government signed a wide-ranging economic
cooperation agreement with Albania last year that will also involve
the country in regional efforts to clean up the Adriatic Sea.
   Before Americans can call Albania, financial and technical
hurdles must be cleared, Wallerstein said. U.S. telephone companies
must get paid a share for the calls placed to and from Albania, and
a direct-dial system must be established.
   Albania currently places calls to Western countries though
relays in either Greece or Italy, Wallerstein said.

<TEXT>
   A judge imposed a 131{-year prison sentence
on a man convicted of raping, sexually mutiliating and trying to
kill a 7-year-old boy, a crime that triggered a statewide uproar
over sex predators.
   Pierce County Superior Court Judge Thomas R. Sauriol gave Earl
Shriner, 40, three times the maximum standard term for the crime
under state law.
   The judge said Shriner, who has a 25-year record of violence
against young people, should remain locked up until he dies. He
said that if Shriner won time off for good behavior, he would still
have to serve more than 88 years. There is no possibility of parole.
   Sauriol said the case left him more outraged and troubled than
any in his 37-year legal career.
   ``I don't think that I have ever heard of a case that borders on
extreme cruelty more than this one,'' he told Shriner. ``The
reality is, Mr. Shriner, you present a danger to the defenseless.''
   Shriner, who is slightly retarded, stood silent and motionless,
leaning forward slightly at the bar.
   The victim's mother, Helen Harlow, dabbing her eyes and
comforted by friends, said she was satisfied with the sentence.
   Shriner was convicted Feb. 7 of first-degree attempted murder,
first-degree assault and two counts of first-degree rape in the May
20 attack in woods near his and the boy's homes.
   The boy was raped and choked, and his penis was cut off.
   Neighbors found the youngster naked, bloody, covered with mud
and practically incoherent.
   Following sentencing, defense attorney Dino Sepe gave notice he
would appeal the penalty and the verdict.
   Defense attorneys said Shriner's sentence should have been
within the standard range of 34 years to 43 years and 10 months.
   Sauriol gave Shriner half the sentence prosecutors requested,
but deputy prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet said the penalty
``served the purpose.''
   The judge also ordered Shriner to pay $2,500 toward the cost of
his court-appointed attorneys and $1,500 to a Pierce County project
to help child abuse victims.
   The uproar that followed the attack led to legislative adoption
of tougher penalties and controls on sexual predators, including
longer sentences, civil commitment and registration of sex
offenders. Harlow served on the goveror's task force that drafted
the law.
   In sentencing Shriner, Sauriol criticized other legislation that
would have permitted a 75 percent reduction in prison terms for sex
offenders who voluntarily submit to surgical castration.
   The measure died in the state House of Representatives after
clearing the Senate this year.
   The judge said any legislator who votes for such a measure in
the future ``would be defeated the following time he runs for
office, and he would deserve it.''
   Harlow, her voice breaking and fighting back tears, told the
judge the attack had shattered her and her son's lives and had
continued to cause pain as the case came up repeatedly in news
reports. She said her son continues with his recovery, which
includes reconstructive surgery.
   The boy, who identified Shriner in court as his attacker, was
not present.
   Shriner did not speak on his behalf, but his brother, John, and
mother, Dolores, said his guilt had not been established and that
mitigating or extenuating circumstances had been disregarded.
   Shriner was declared a ``defective delinquent'' in 1965 after
choking a 7-year-old girl. The term, now abandoned, referred to
violence-prone juveniles with emotional or mental problems.
   He subsequently was confined at Rainier School for the retarded;
Western State Hospital, a mental institution, and the Washington
Corrections Center, where he served 10 years for assaulting two
16-year-old hitchhikers.

<TEXT>
   The 87 people who died in a social club fire
were martyrs to the quest for a better life, just like 146 people
killed exactly 79 years earlier in a fire in a city garment
factory, Mayor David Dinkins said Monday.
   Dinkins told about 700 people at a memorial service for victims
of the 1911 fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. that both tragedies
killed immigrants looking for improved living conditions in America.
   ``With vicious irony yesterday, on the 79th anniversary of the
Triangle Shirtwaist fire, history repeated itself,'' the mayor said
at the site of the earlier blaze.
   On Sunday, the bodies of trapped revelers were found packed into
the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx. A Cuban immigrant was
charged with setting fire to the club's only exit after he was
thrown out.
   Authorities said the club's patrons never had a chance to escape
the blaze because the building did not follow fire codes. It was
the same lack of concern for people that caused such devastation at
the Triangle factory in Greenwich Village, Dinkins said.
   ``So the lessons of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire are not
something we commemorate today, they are lessons that have been
driven home for us all to learn, once again,'' Dinkins said.
   ``Now, the martyrs of March 25, 1911, and the martyrs of March
25, 1990, are joined forever,'' he said. ``Like the victims at the
Happy Land Social Club, most of those who died on this killing
ground were immigrants to our shores.''
   ``They, too, came to America to find a dream. Instead, they
found misery, exploitation and an agonizing death,'' he said.
``These 146 workers didn't have to die. Neither did the 87 people
in the Bronx.''
   Later, a fire truck ladder was raised up to the 10-story
building's sixth floor, the highest a fire ladder would go in those
days, as a fire bell was rung to mark the deaths. A wreath of white
roses was placed above pictures of the fire.
   ``They died at this building because they were seen as surplus
labor. They died because they didn't speak English very well,
because they weren't organized, because no one spoke up for them or
represented their interests and because their employer didn't care
about them,'' Dinkins said.
   ``In fact, that very day in 1911, their boss went out late in
the afternoon and locked all the workers of the Triangle Shirtwaist
Co. inside, just to make sure none of them tried to leave early
while he did some shopping,'' he said.
   ``All 146 of them died painfully, horribly, just like the 87 who
died yesterday,'' the mayor added. ``And all of them died
unnecessarily, just like the 87 who died yesterday.''
   He recalled, though, that the workers' deaths inspired the labor
movement and brought about lasting changes in laws to protect
workers. Sweatshops have re-emerged in recent years and it is
necessary again to battle exploitation, Dinkins said.
   ``And again, there are those operating in the shadows, running
sweatshops and illegal social clubs and pursuing other schemes,
turning the lure and promise of America into a nightmare for those
who seek to redeem the promise,'' he said.

   Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union
defeated Jan Timman of The Netherlands on Monday in the ninth game
of the world chess playoffs to win 6{-2{ and earn the right to face
world chess champion Garri Kasparov.
   Karpov, 38, who won in 56 moves after six hours of play, will
challenge Kasparov in Lyons, France, in October.
   The Karpov-Kasparov duel renews one of the hottest rivalries in
chess history.
   Kasparov, the 26-year-old Soviet champion, is the highest-ranked
player in history, according to the biannual ranking list of the
International Chess Federation.
   In 1986, he defeated archrival Karpov in their second title duel
and became, at 22, the youngest titleholder in history.
   Impatient, outspoken and decisive, Kasparov publicly criticized
Soviet sports officials a year before Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev allowed greater openness.
   Kasparov has a British manager to look after his business
interests, appears live on Western talk shows and has been
interviewed by Playboy magazine.
   Karpov held the world title for 10 years before first defending
it against Kasparov in 1985.

<HEAD>Religious Leader Says Labor Party Ignores Religious Teachings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spiritual leader of two religious
parties Monday appeared to hurt the Labor Party's chances of
forming a coalition government by saying Labor had failed to keep
Israel on the path of Judaism.
   Labor leaders had hoped Rabbi Eliezar Menachem Schach, the
spiritual mentor of the ultra-Orthodox Degel Hatorah and Shas
parties, would in his televised speech break a deadlock in efforts
by the left-leaning Labor Party to form a government.
   But his speech at a meeting of Degel Hatorah members was largely
a sermon on Israel's failures to stay on what he called the true
path of the Bible.
   ``The Labor Party was the one who detached the Jew from
tradition,'' Schach, 92, said. ``But all of the others have also
forgotten about their fathers. We should not be drawn after bodies
that have no link to Judaism.'' About 10,000 men dressed in the
traditional black garb of the ultra-Orthodox packed a basketball
stadium in Tel Aviv to hear the Lithuanian-born rabbi speak.
   Women were barred from the event but were able to follow on
closed-circut broadcasts in the B'nei Brak religious suburb of Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem.
   Peres, who claims to have the support of 60 of the 120 members
of parliament, needs the backing of one of the religious parties to
rule. The Degel Hatorah party has two seats and the Shas party six.
   Before Schach spoke, the crowd sang hymns and swayed in religous
prayer. When he entered the stadium the crowd sang out: ``May God
add days to the life of the king.''
   Schach criticized Israel for holding onto the occupied
territories.
   ``Territory doesn't guarantee existence,'' he said.
   Schach, known for his dovish views, said he believed the left
has historically distanced itself from Judaism.
   This paradoxically gives a boost to the right-wing Likud bloc
led by caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose party's
founding principles included keeping the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Degel Hatorah legislator Avraham Ravitz echoed Schach's
criticism of Labor and said he believed the spiritual leader backs
Likud.
   ``We have to identify ourselves with those who identify more
with us. That means that for now we will probably support the Likud
and push them to support a national unity government,'' Ravitz told
reporters.
   A Shas spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovaida Yosef, also spoke at the
Degel Hatorah meeting in a show of solidarity.
   ``Both our movements take the advice of Rabbi Schach. Our two
movements go hand in hand, God forbid if there should ever be
conflict between us,'' he said.
   The comments by the religious leaders made the situation bleak
for Labor, but Moshe Shahal, a Labor parliament member, told Israel
television there was still room for political maneuvering.
   President Chaim Herzog gave Peres the task of forming a new
coalition government on March 20 after Labor brought down the
Likud-led government with a no-confidence motion in parliament over
Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. Mideast peace proposals.
   Peres has 42 days left to form a government. Shamir Monday
repeated his belief that the Labor leader would fail and said he
would assemble a government when Peres' time runs out.
   Labor negotiators have been involved in a horsetrading with
left-wing parties and religious parties and Monday reached an
agreement with the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party to join a
Labor-led coaltion, Israel radio said.
   Agudat Israel, with five seats in parliament, still must receive
the approval of its council of Torah sages before it can sign the
agreement, the radio said.
   Agugat Israel legislator Moshe Feldman said the council could
decide to make approval conditional on another religious party
joining a Labor-led government.

   The Bush administration on Monday opposed
Soviet military occupation of three buildings in the capital of
Lithuania but said Moscow's actions so far don't threaten June's
U.S.-Soviet summit.
   The occupation of Communist Party buildings in Vilnius is ``a
kind of force and we're opposed to any kind of use of force,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   He said that tensions in the secessionist republic ``seem to
have escalated on a daily basis . ... Building occupation is a
significant event in this sense.''
   Nonetheless, Fitzwater said, ``The Soviets themselves have
publicly and privately assured us that they have no intentions of
using military force to resolve the issue.''
   Addressing the summit planned in June between President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Fitzwater said:
   ``We're prepared to have the summit at (that) time. We're still
hopeful this can be resolved.''
   On the subject of recent Soviet no-force assurances, Fitzwater
said that Moscow's promises were reiterated on Friday during a
State Department meeting between Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger and Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin.
   Dubinin earlier in the week had offered similar assurances to
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the White House said.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III sent a private message to Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze over the weekend regarding the
situation in Lithuania.
   Tutwiler said a meeting on tap next week between Baker and
Shevardnadze was still planned.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat visiting the
Soviet Union, said Monday that Gorbachev had told him there are no
plans to use force to bring Lithuania back into the Soviet fold.
   After meeting with Gorbachev for 1{ hours, Kennedy said the
Soviet leader ``indicated to me that the position of the Soviet
Union was that there would be no use of force unless the lives of
others were threatened, and that he was committed to a peaceful
resolution.''
   In an interview with National Public Radio, Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis said the situation had become ``very
dangerous'' in the light of Gorbachev's reported remarks to Kennedy.
   ``Before he always said that he would not use force in
Lithuania, but now we have a situation where he's qualifying that
statement and setting a condition under which he could use force.
   ``The only danger to the lives and health of the residents of
Lithuania is the presence of Soviet army troops themselves,''
Landsbergis said.
   Soviet soldiers took over two schools in Vilnius on Sunday, the
Higher Party School and the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
Lithuanian officials said there also were soldiers at the Vilnius
Communist Party headquarters.
   Lithuanian officials on Monday said tensions had eased somewhat
after they met with Soviet military officers on the action.
   Fitzwater said the negotiations between the military and
Lithuanian authorities were ``a good sign.''
   ``But that's far from resolving the total issue,'' he added.
``We believe it's important to continue to maintain our position
and forcefully state our interest in this matter on a continuing
basis.''
   He said the building occupations were ``under the general
framework of the pattern of intimidation that we have objected to
in the past.''
   ``We object to a pattern of intimidation,'' he added.
   ``It is incumbent that both sides maintain open communication
and not take any actions that can be misinterpreted,'' Fitzwater
said, reading a statement at the beginning of Monday's daily news
briefing.
   ``Further actions will not lead to a lessening of the tensions
and could have adverse international repercussions and could be
counterproductive for U.S.-Soviet relations,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union considers Lithuania's March 11 declaration of
independence illegal. The United States has never recognized the
Baltic state's incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   While urging support for the self-determination rights of
Lithuanians, the administration has not opened formal diplomatic
relations with Vilnius, citing Lithuanian's inability to exercise
any real control over its borders or its destiny.

<HEAD>Shiite Cleric Sees `Elements of Solution' with Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's most influential Shiite
Moslem cleric believes ``elements of a solution'' exist in the
dispute over Western hostages in Lebanon, a newspaper reported
Monday.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide for the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, said there was no truth to reports he was
asked to help resolve the hostage crisis.
   Most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon are believed held by
groups linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   ``There are positive elements, within the context of what we
detect through media reports in more than one place, that suggest
elements of a solution exist in the hostage crisis,'' Fadlallah
said in an interview with the pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq newspaper.
   Asked whether he was contacted about the hostages by Jimmy
Carter during the former U.S. president's recent Middle East peace
mission, Fadlallah said:
   ``There is no connection at all ... because I am not involved
directly or indirectly in the core of the problem.''
   ``But I always try to raise responsible words, with which I
address those concerned with this issue, in order that this case be
closed once and for all,'' he said.
   Fadlallah traveled to Damascus during Carter's visit to the
Syrian capital earlier this month, but diplomatic sources said the
two did not meet.
   Fadlallah's remarks came four days after his press office quoted
the cleric as saying in a radio interview when asked about the
possibility of a hostage release:
   ``A new situation has emerged, but I don't know when, how or
where.'' The statement did not elaborate.
   Fadlallah's remarks heightened speculation there was movement in
efforts to secure the release of the eight Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian held
hostage.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
Several other captives have been held almost as long.
   Repeated statements from Iranian and Lebanese officials as well
as recent editorials in Tehran newspapers have fueled speculation a
release was near.
   In an editorial Sunday, the English-language Tehran Times said
``Iran will of course use its good offices with the Lebanese groups
... to facilitate the release of Western hostages.''
   The Tehran Times, which often reflects the thinking of Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, sparked speculation about a possible
release when it said last month ``1990 can and will be the last
year of captivity for these hostages.''
   Moderates led by Rafsanjani have said the issue is moving toward
a solution, but his hard-line opponents contradict that. Iran's
former hard-line interior minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, argued
against the hostages' release in a signed editorial in a Tehran
newspaper this month.
   Mohtashemi helped found Hezbollah in 1983 and is believed to
have more clout with the kidnappers than Rafsanjani.

   The man accused of setting fire to the Happy
Land social club was arraigned Monday on charges of murdering 87
people, and police said he told them ``the devil got into me.''
   Authorities began shutting other illegal clubs in response to
New York City's worst fire in 79 years.
   The families of the 87 victims, most of whom were Honduran or
Dominican immigrants, sought solace in their grief, and a
government task force was set up to counsel them and help make
funeral arrangements.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was accused of setting the fire early Sunday
with $1 worth of gasoline after arguing with a former girlfriend
who worked at the illegal club. He is said to have threatened to
``shut this place down.''
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' Gonzalez told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   During a hearing at Bronx County Criminal Court, Gonzalez was
charged with 87 counts of murder committed during the course of
arson; 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to human life;
one count of attempted murder; and two counts of arson.
   The case was turned over to a grand jury, and Gonzalez will not
be asked to enter a plea unless an indictment is issued. He was
held under a suicide watch at the Rikers Island jail and later
admitted to Kings County Hospital Psychiatric Ward, where he will
be held indefinitely, said Ruby Ryles, a city jails spokeswoman.
   The deaths were believed to be the most ever charged to a single
suspect in the continental United States.
   ``He is a double animal,'' said Rene J. Mena, 63, whose son,
Rene Jr., 30, died. ``Here, they're going to have good food for
him, a book, a movie. In Central America, we don't do it that way.''
   District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said he hoped that if
Gonzalez is convicted, he would get consecutive prison sentences
amounting to 2,000 years.
   An equally angry Mayor David Dinkins ordered a sweep of other
suspected unlicensed social clubs. Police and a special task force
visited 241 clubs citywide from midnight to 7 a.m. Monday and
posted vacate orders on 187.
   Only 23 of the clubs were open _ most are closed on Sunday
nights. There were 52 safety violations and 30 summonses issued,
said Sgt. Dick Vreeland, a police spokesman.
   In the East Tremont section of the Bronx, families drifted in
and out of Public School 67, across from the fire-blackened club. A
task force of state, city and private agencies there helped them
make funeral arrangements and offered counseling and financial
assistance.
   ``It's orderly, but it's not emotionally orderly,'' said Ken
Curtin, a local Red Cross disaster relief director. ``It's highly
charged. There are a lot of outbursts of grief.''
   In Honduras, a foreign ministry spokesman said the government
``is deeply moved by the deaths of many countrymen in New York.''
The Honduran telephone company said it was swamped with calls from
people seeking word about loved ones.
   The fire broke out at 3:40 a.m. Sunday, and those inside the
club suffocated, burned or were trampled to death in a matter of
minutes.
   They had to ``choose between a wall of fire or retreating and
dying of asphyxiation,'' Johnson said.
   Police believe five people escaped from the fire: three patrons;
Gonzalez's former girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano; and the club disc
jockey.
   The disc jockey, identified in published reports as Ruben
Valladares, was listed as stable at Jacobi Hospital with burns over
30 percent of his body, said hospital spokeswoman Vicki Ciampa.
   Ms. Feliciano and the others, whose names were withheld, escaped
serious injury. Ms. Feliciano is in protective custody.
   Johnson said Gonzalez had been ejected from the club after
arguing with Ms. Feliciano and threatening to ``shut this place
down.''
   He allegedly bought $1 worth of gasoline at a nearby service
station, then returned and faked making a telephone call when he
saw a possible witness. When that person left, he allegedly poured
gasoline between the street and an inside door of the club and
ignited it.
   After that, Johnson said, he watched it burn for a while, making
statements to at least two witnesses about his role in the fire. He
then went home, where police found him a few hours later. He made a
videotaped admission to police, authorities said.
   Johnson said Gonzalez knew the two-story club lacked windows,
rear exits and adequate staircases. He also knew how crowded it
was, authorities said.
   Gonzalez, who came to the United States from Cuba on the 1980
Mariel boatlift, had no arrest record here, Johnson said.
   Johnson said he has the name of a possible club owner, but will
not release it until it's confirmed. A vacate order was issued in
November 1988 and again a year later because Happy Land lacked a
proper sprinkler system, exits, emergency lighting and signs. It
also had no liquor or cabaret license, the mayor said.
   The fire struck on the 79th anniversary of the Triangle
Shirtwaist Co. fire. That 1911 tragedy claimed 146 lives, many of
them immigrant garment workers, leading to nationwide reforms in
workplace safety.
   Dinkins discussed night club tragedy while addressing 700
garment workers and other union members who gathered Monday in
Lower Manhattan to commemorate the Triangle fire.
   ``They came to America in search of a better life. Early
yesterday morning their American dream became a fatal nightmare,''
said Dinkins, who inspected the scene of Sunday's fire.
   ``The sight of those bodies, lined along the walls like so many
wax figures, and the realization of the panic and the pain they
must have suffered in their last moments, will remain with me for
the rest of my life,'' said Dinkins. ``Most horrifying is that this
should never have happened.''
   Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor officiated at an
hour-long, English and Spanish prayer service outside the club on
Monday afternoon. A thousand mourners began the service by walking
a few blocks from St. Thomas Aquinas church, the parish of many of
the victims.
   ``We pray for those who died,'' said O'Connor. ``We pray in a
special way for those who survived. We need to pray for the dead
and for the survivors. ... Our best is never good enough in
circumstances of this sort.''

<HEAD>25 Atoll Residents on Trial for Religious Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHE MARQUAND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PAPEETE, French Polynesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court Monday began trying 25
residents of a South Pacific atoll who are accused of torturing to
death six islanders in a hunt for demons and sorcerers.
   Testimony in the trial, described as the largest ever in French
Polynesia, is expected to focus on how a small number of people
could terrorize a larger group in the name of religion.
   Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the Roman Catholic leader in
French Polynesia, said the case involves ``simply a religious
perversion due to an abuse of trust and a lack of authority on the
island.''
   The defendants, representing about an eighth of the population
of the South Pacific atoll of Faaite, are accused of murder,
inciting violence and other offenses during two horror-filled days
in 1987.
   According to investigators, three women came to the atoll in
August 1987 from Tahiti, 310 miles to the west. The trio claimed to
be faith-healers connected to the Roman Catholic-affiliated
movement Charismatic Renewal, founded in the United States in 1967
and active throughout much of Polynesia.
   However, Coppenrath, who spent 15 days on Faaite counseling
families after the killings, said the women were not authentic
representatives of Charismatic Renewal.
   The women were regarded as priestesses by the islanders and
gained enormous influence, investigators said. Faaite's mayor was
away, and there were no police or religious authorities posted
there.
   At one point, the women ordered a crippled man to get up and
walk. When he failed, they said demons were interfering with their
work, investigators said.
   The women instructed the islanders to repent of their sins and
departed within a few weeks.
   However, they left behind a dozen youthful disciples who divined
on Sept. 2 that the assistant mayor, Iaone Harris, was possessed by
demons.
   The disciples held hallucinatory seances in the tiny church and
repeatedly dunked the official in sea water to ``purify'' him,
investigators say. They say he died, allegedly after severe
beatings, and the disciples burned his body at the church.
   His death set off a two-day hunt for sorcerers conducted by half
the islanders against the others, investigators said. Three more
men and two women were burned alive, included a mentally disturbed
man and a mother who pleaded for the life of her son.
   Ten children of the atoll were orphaned by the violence.
   Four more executions planned for Sept. 4 were thwarted when
frightened islanders established telephone contact with officials
in Papeete, the French Polynesia capital.
   The mayor, a priest and a police unit arrived and suppressed the
witch hunt. Many of the suspects interrogated by police professed
to be upholding the Christian faith.
   The proceeding before the Tribunal in Papeete will feature 15
islanders testifying against 25 neighbors. The jury is expected to
have a verdict after two weeks' testimony.

<HEAD>Swedes Propose Strict Tobacco Law: $5 a Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TORUN REINHAMMAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette prices would rise to $5 a
pack, tobacco advertising would be banned and minors would be
barred from buying cigarettes under a proposal submitted to the
government Monday.
   Everyone should have the right to a smoke-free environment, said
an accompanying report, the first government study on smoking since
1973.
   Its recommendations would give Sweden, along with Norway and
Finland, one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws.
   The Swedish tobacco industry said it would suffer from an
advertising ban and lose out to foreign brands.
   ``A bunch of well-paid tobacco-hating bureaucrats spent a year
on nice trips and came up with nothing sensible,'' Klaus Unger,
chairman of Swedish Tobacco Co., was quoted as saying by the
Expressen newspaper.
   Smokepeace, a lobby against laws that would further limit
smokers' rights, said the recommendations would give ``hard-pressed
supermarket cashiers the duties of policemen.''
   Some of the proposals, already adopted by other countries,
proved ineffective in stopping youngsters from smoking, the lobby
said.
   The report, submitted to Social Affairs Minister Ingela Thalen,
is the first stage of the legislative process that could take
several months. It must be submitted for comment to various
interested parties, including the tobacco industry, and may undergo
major revisions before it becomes law.
   The report recommended a 15-milligram limit on tar in
cigarettes. That would effectively ban 36 popular brands now on
sale in Sweden, including 26 imported brands. Finland already has a
similar ban, and the report said the European Community will adopt
the limit in 1993.
   Roland Perlstrom, speaking for the industry, said the proposal
was unnecessary because smokers are switching to low-tar
cigarettes, which already have 60 percent of the market.
   Under the proposal, cigarette prices would rise 50 percent to $5.
   Hotels would be required to forbid smoking in half their rooms,
and restaurants with more than 50 seats would have to have
non-smoking areas. At work places, smoking would be allowed in
designated areas or in offices only if the smoke did not spread to
smoke-free zones.
   ``After what we know about the damaging effects of tobacco, the
use of tobacco cannot be regarded and treated as a harmless habit
or a private matter any more,'' the report said.

   A 30-year-old grandson of James S. Rockefeller
left Fiji Monday night, apparently after being bitten on a leg by a
shark while swimming at an exclusive island resort.
   The Fiji Times newspaper said Ola Stillman Rockefeller was
injured on Saturday soon after he arrived at Laucala Island, about
120 miles northeast of Fiji's capital, Suva.
   The isolated resort is owned by the estate of the late American
billionaire Malcolm Forbes.
   Rockefeller, a bachelor, told the newspaper he had been swimming
alone in waist-deep water about 30 yards offshore when he felt his
right leg being ``pulled.''
   Looking down, he said he saw it had been lacerated, apparently
by two bites from a shark.
   He said he managed to swim to shore and crawl to his bungalow
where he telephoned for help.
   Resort workers applied first-aid before a nurse from a village
health clinic could assist. A doctor from a nearby hospital was
brought in by boat several hours later.
   On arrival, Dr. Viliame Taoi said he found Rockefeller in stable
condition, but he ``appeared to have lost some blood.'' His
Achilles tendon had been lacerated and required stiches.
   At dawn Sunday, Rockefeller was flown by the Forbes' private
plane to a hospital in Lautoka, Fiji's second-largest city.
   He left Fiji on an overnight flight to the United States
accompanied by a medical team from Australia and with his right
ankle in a plaster cast.
   ``I have not been discouraged by the experience,'' he was quoted
as telling The Fiji Times newspaper before departing.
   Rockefeller is the grandson of James S. Rockefeller, who was a
chairman of the City Bank of New York, which became Citibank.
   Michael Rockefeller, son of then-New York Gov. Nelson D.
Rockfeller, vanished in November 1961, off Irian Jaya, an
Indonesian territory that shares its island border with Papua New
Guinea.
   Michael, then 23, disappeared while swimming from his capsized
catamaran in shark-infested waters. The island of Irian Jaya and
Papua New Guinea is about 1,000 miles west of Fiji.

   Greece on Monday protested to Turkey over
a dam project and a reported shooting incident during a week of
escalating border tension between the two Aegean neighbors.
   In the latest incident Monday, crews from four Greek trawlers
claimed a Turkish patrol boat opened fire on them in Greek
territorial waters northeast of the Aegean island of Lesvos.
   A spokesman for the island's harbor authorities reported no
injuries.
   Ambassador Dimitris Makris protested to a Foreign Ministry
official in Ankara, Turkey, that Turkish soldiers fired warning
shots Sunday at a Greek fisherman at Doiran, an island shared by
the two countries on the northern Evros River border. No injuries
were reported there either.
   In the second protest, Makris asked Turkey to dismantle a small
sandbag dam that local authorities set up March 18 linking Doiran
to mainland Turkey.
   Government spokesman Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who announced the
protests, said Makris repeated a proposal by Greek local
authorities that an existing Greek-Turkish committee meet to
resolve the problem of the dam.
   The spokesman said earlier that Turkey used the dam to make the
island look as if it were an extension of the Turkish mainland.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with witness saying List told family he

<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John E. List told his family he planned
to kill them before his wife, mother and three children were slain
at their mansion and he disappeared for 18 years, a witness
testified Monday.
   The hearing on evidence in List's murder trial also saw the
first public release of a note in which he implied he killed his
family because he couldn't support them and because he knew ``they
would all be Christians.''
   The witness, drama teacher Edwin Illiano, said List's
16-year-old daughter, Patricia, mentioned the threat as he was
driving her home from rehearsal at a municipal drama society in
1971.
   ``The father had announced to the family that he was going to
murder the entire family,'' Illiano testified. He said the girl was
sobbing and near hysteria.
   After the teen-ager began missing rehearsals that November,
Illiano began driving by the List home. He said he told List's
pastor and former Police Chief James Moran, now retired, of his
concern, but was not taken seriously.
   On Dec. 7, police found the family members' bullet-riddled
bodies. That was about a month after Illiano learned of the threat,
he said outside court.
   Defense attorney Elijah L. Miller Jr. has moved to exclude
evidence collected from List's 18-room mansion in the New York City
suburb of Westfield, arguing the home was entered illegally.
   Evidence in contention includes a note dated Nov. 9, 1971, and
left for List's mother-in-law, Eva Morris, and an insurance
associate.
   ``By now no doubt you know what has happened to Helen and the
children. I'm very sorry that it had to happen,'' List, a devout
church-going Sunday school teacher and accountant, wrote Mrs.
Morris.
   ``But because of a number of reasons I couldn't see any other
solution,'' he said. ``I just couldn't support them anymore and I
didn't want them to go into poverty. Also, at this time I know that
they would all be Christians. I couldn't be sure of that in the
future as the children grow up.''
   He signed it, ``with my sincere sympathies, John E. List.''
   Superior Court Judge William L'E. Wertheimer is expected to
decide on Miller's motions before opening arguments scheduled for
Friday.
   Miller apparently called Illiano as a witness because he
contradicted police testimony that officers entered the house first
out of concern for the safety of List's 85-year-old mother, Alma.
   Illiano had goine to the house that night with a fellow drama
group member out of concern for Patricia List.
   ``With one fluid movement I opened the window and entered the
house,'' he said. He said he was followed by police. However, in a
statement to police Dec. 8, 1971, he said the officers went first.
   Illiano explained the discrepancy by saying he was anxious ``to
get out of there.''
   Illiano was preceded by retired Westfield police Detective
Robert J. Bell, who led the murder investigation.
   Bell identified five notes taped to file cabinet and desk
drawers addressed to List's insurance agent, the estate's
administrator and his Lutheran pastor, Eugene Rehwinkel.
   Bell also said there were notes written on lined yellow paper
that included notes to the children's schools explaining that the
family had to leave town.
   The detective said a .22-caliber pistol and a 9mm automatic were
found in a desk drawer.
   Retired patrolman George Zhelesnick testified earlier that he
was sent to the home after neighbors expressed concern about Alma
List and a suspicious car in the driveway. The car turned out to be
Illiano's.
   The former policeman said he found an unlocked dining-room
window after circling the house.
   He said he entered the house, followed by his partners and two
friends of Patricia List.
   ``It was at that time I saw what appeared to be four bodies
lying on the floor,'' Zhelesnick recalled.
   He said he radioed for help and went back to search the rest of
the home.
   He and partner Charles Haller found Alma List's body in a
third-floor storage room.
   List was arrested last June in the Richmond, Va., suburb of
Midlothian, where he had been living as Robert Clark.
   He has maintained that he is innocent because of his mental
condition at the time of the killings.

<HEAD>Yasser Arafat: Soviet Jews Settling in West Bank are a Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the PLO, said
Monday the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel and fears that they
would be settled in the West Bank posed a threat to security and
stability in the Mideast.
   The danger of such a policy would undermine international
efforts, putting the region ``on the brink of war and
destruction,'' the Palestine Liberation Organization leader was
quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India at a banquet given in
his honor by India President Ramaswamy Venkataraman.
   Arafat arrived in New Delhi Monday on a three-day visit to
accept the Jawaharlal Nehru award for peace and international
understanding. Nehru was India's first prime minister.
   On arrival he said of the Soviet Jews migration plan: ``We will
continue to deal with our friends in Moscow for the sake of our
people and at the same time with respect for the human rights.''
   He told journalists it was too soon to say whether an Israeli
government headed by Shimon Peres would affect Middle East peace
talks.
   ``We have to wait and see _ not to spoil the cooking.''
   Peres, the Israeli Labor Party leader, is trying to form a
government after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir lost a confidence
vote in Parliament. Peres has been more open to some sort of
dialogue with Palestinians on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip than Likud Bloc leader Shamir, his erstwhile coalition
government partner.
   The PLO leader, a pistol on his right hip, spoke to reporters
after receiving the 21-gun salute India accords foreign heads of
state. He was received by Venkataraman and Prime Minister V.P.
Singh.
   India was one of the first non-Arab nations to recognize the
PLO's declaration of Palestinian statehood in 1988. Arafat was
given similar head-of-state treatment on his last visit a year ago.
   On Wednesday he is scheduled to fly to Calcutta to visit Mother

near the Israeli front line.

<TEXT>
   Bomb blasts within 10 minutes of each
other early Tuesday wrecked the cars of nine foreign diplomats in
four Athens suburbs. No injuries were reported in the explosions,
police said.
   Three of the vehicles belonged to diplomats from Czechoslovakia,
two from the Soviet Union and one each from the embassies of Syria,
Hungary, Bulgaria and the Palestine Liberation Organization's envoy
in Athens, a police spokesman said.
   Initial investigations indicated eight of the cars were
destroyed by time bombs, the spokesman said, who requested
anonymity in line with practice.
   The blasts in the suburbs of Ilissia, Halandri, Paleo Psychiko
and Ambelokipi began about 2 a.m. and ended 10 minutes later, the
spokesman said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the
explosions.
   Similar attacks have been carried out in the past by the
November 17 urban guerrilla organisation.
   The leftist group has killed 14 people, including three American
officials. None of its members has ever been caught.
   Anarchist youths have firebombed police cars and party offices
in a spate of attacks the past three weeks, injuring one policeman.
   Greece's general elections are April 8.

<HEAD>Indicates Lack Of Action By Pilot To Deal With Emergency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pilot of Avianca Flight 52 was aware
that he was low on gas but appeared ``inattentive'' to the problem
and seemed to take ``little action'' in communicating it to air
controllers, a source told The Associated Press Monday.
   The flight's co-pilot and flight engineer also took no bold
steps to alert the captain or controllers to the fuel emergency, a
source close to the investigation said. He spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   The findings were based on conversations recorded in the cockpit
of the Colombian flight during the 30 minutes before it crashed
into a hillside in Cove Neck, Long Island, Jan. 25, killing 73 of
the 159 aboard.
   The transcripts, which were to be released Tuesday by the
National Transportation Safety Board, indicated that the lack of
communication among the cockpit crew contributed to the crash.
   The Boeing 707 from Bogota and Medellin, Colombia, crashed in
fog and rain on final approach just northeast of John F. Kennedy
International Airport.
   Investigators believe the plane crashed because it ran out of
fuel.
   They are not certain why the crew members failed to make it
clear to air traffic controllers how urgent their fuel shortage had
become.
   The recorded conversations indicate that the crew, mostly in
Spanish, discussed the dwindling fuel supply among themselves.
   The transcripts appear to show a pilot who did not seem to be in
full charge of the situation, the source said, and who did not give
specific, essential direction to the co-pilot to declare an
emergency.
   They also showed a co-pilot who had just 2{ years of experience
flying into JFK and appeared reluctant to assert himself, the
source said.
   The flight engineer had several years' experience but also
seemed to be hesitant to speak up, although he appeared to be
subtly trying to remind the pilot of the fuel shortage, the source
said.
   All three crew members died in the crash.
   After aborting his first approach, the captain, a 17-year
veteran pilot, asked the co-pilot if he had told air traffic
controllers that they had an ``emergency.''
   The co-pilot, who handled most of the communications with
controllers, did answered: ``I told them we're low on fuel.''
   The captain, according to the transcripts, did not respond to
the co-pilot, nor did he follow-up by instructing the co-pilot to
tell air traffic control that they had an emergency.
   After the aborted approach, the crew accepted, without
challenge, a new route for a second approach that looped over the
Long Island Sound.
   At that point, investigators have said, the pilot and crew made
a deadly mistake.
   They should have made it clear to controllers that they needed
to come straight in for a landing. Even a straight in landing,
where the plane would have needed to make a tight loop, would have
used six or seven minutes of fuel.
   From the misapproach to fuel burn-out the plane took a little
over eight minutes.
   The Avianca crash seems to be strikingly similar to the crash of
United Airline's DC-8 in Portland, Oregon in December, 1978. Both
were due to fuel exhaustion.
   The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the United
Airlines accident was ``the failure of the captain to monitor
properly the aircraft's fuel state and to properly respond to the
low fuel state,'' according to a NTSB report on the accident.
   The board found that the United pilot's inattention resulted
from preoccupation with a landing gear malfunction.
   Contributing to the Portland accident, the report stated, ``was
the failure of the other two flight crew members either to fully
comprehend the criticality of the fuel state or to successfully
communicate their concern to the pilot.''
   The NTSB investigation of the Avianca accident is said to be
focusing on the coordination and communications among the pilot,
co-pilot and flight engineer.
   A report on the probable cause of the Avianca accident is
expected in about 10 months.
   Mike Benson, a spokesman for the NTSB, and Fred Farrar, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, were not in
their offices when phoned late Monday afternoon and did not
immediately return calls for comment.

<HEAD>Pan Am Sued by Flight 103 Victim's Family, Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am customers, including a couple
whose daughter died in the bombing of Flight 103, sued the airline
Monday claiming it collected surcharges for a security system that
was never developed.
   The lawsuit charged that millions of Pan Am passengers between
1986 and 1989 were defrauded by the $5-a-ticket security surcharge
on trans-Atlantic flights and an advertising campaign on the
development of the security system.
   ``After enticing the traveling public into purchasing tickets on
Pan Am flights and subsidizing a supposedly efficient security
system, defendants made conscious decisions not to create that
system,'' the lawsuit alleged.
   The lawsuit filed in Superior Court was intended as a class
action for customers who purchased tickets affected by the case,
said Richard A. Grossman, the attorney handling the case.
   The lawsuit also alleges that a private consultant hired by Pan
Am in 1986 to review security warned the airline was vulnerable to
terrorist attack. The consultant warned that the advertising
campaign touting beefed-up flight security could be considered
fraudulent unless changes were made, Grossman said.
   The plaintiffs included Peter and Aphrodite Tsairis of Franklin
Lakes, and the estate of their daughter, Alexia Tsairis, a Syracuse
University undergraduate killed when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. The downing of the
Boeing 747 killed all 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on the
ground.
   ``Damages could amount to over $100 million, with more than a
million passengers in line for refunds plus punitive damages,''
Grossman said.
   Pan Am said in a statement issued by its legal department that
the lawsuit's attempt to recover damages for the death of Ms.
Tsairis would be handled like all other such claims.
   But the company said there was ``absolutely no merit'' to the
lawsuit's class-action claims. Company spokeswoman Elizabeth
Manners said Pan Am would make a motion to dismiss that aspect of
the lawsuit.
   Ms. Manners said about $18 million was collected in 1989 through
the security surcharges, but could not provide amounts for earlier
years. The spokeswoman said the airline spent nearly $47 million on
security last year.
   Another plaintiff was T. Jennifer Vail, a 20-year-old law
student from Wilmington, Del., with no connection to the crash. Ms.
Vail is a Pan Am customer seeking reimbursement of the surcharges
and represents others like her, Grossman said.
   The lawsuit alleges the airline's own security expert, Isaac
Yeffet, former head of security for El Al Airlines in Israel, told
Pan Am officials almost two years before the Flight 103 crash that
the carrier's security was ``almost totally ineffectual.''
   Named as defendants were Pan Am Corp., and its subsidiaries, Pan
American World Airways Inc. and Pan American World Services Inc.
   Also named were Alert Management Systems Inc., a Pan Am security
subcontractor; C. Edward Acker, a former Pan Am president and chief
executive officer of Pan Am, and Martin E. Shugrue Jr., a former
vice chairman of the corporation and chief executive officer of Pan
Am World Airways, as well as the directors of each company.
   James Stengel, a New York attorney who has defended aircraft
manufacturers in similar litigation, said class actions against
airlines are not unusual, but connecting the surcharge with a fraud
allegation is a novel approach.
   Most claims filed against Pan Am by relatives of Flight 103
victims have been wrongful death and personal injury cases, and
have been combined into a single case, he said.
   Pan Am was fined $630,000 for security and other violations
discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration following the
crash. The company has challenged much of the fine, which is
pending, said Ms. Manners.

<HEAD>Expert: 70,000 May Have Died In Stalin-Era Internment Camps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAARBRUECKEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 70,000 prisoners may
have died in Soviet internment camps on German soil after World War
II, a government official who is an expert on Stalin-era atrocities
said Monday.
   The remark by Gerhard Finn followed reports of the discovery of
mass graves containing the bodies of thousands of prisoners from a
former Soviet internment camp in East Germany.
   East Germany's Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported Saturday that
some Nazi prisoners of war _ such as SS members, police officers,
Nazi party officials and former soldiers in Adolf Hitler's army _
died at the former Fuenfeichen internment camp near Neubrandenburg.
   But the newspaper said the victims also included ``many innocent
people'' and teen-agers. It said the youngest victim was 12 years
old.
   Finn, a department chief in the West German Inter-German
Ministry, said Monday he expected that even more mass graves will
be found.
   ``We estimate that from 65,000 to 70,000 people died in the
internment camps of the Soviet occupying powers'' after World War
II, Finn told Saarlandischer Rundfunk radio in Saarbruecken.
   Finn is the author of a book on the subject, titled ``Political
Prisoners in the Soviet Zone.''
   He said it would be impossible to give an exact figure because
all death certificates of the camps were destroyed.
   Finn said that between 1945 and 1950, up to 200,000 people were
detained in 13 Soviet army camps in East Germany.
   Brutality during the Soviet occupation was kept secret in East
Germany until last fall's popular uprising swept the hard-line
Communist leadership out of power.

   An Environmental Protection Agency regional
official said Monday he will recommend that Denver's proposed Two
Forks dam be vetoed because of the damage it would cause to the
environment.
   The 615-foot-high dam to be built near the confluence of the
South Platte River and its North Fork would flood 30 miles of
scenic river valley and canyon and the town of Deckers to provide
drinking water for up to 360,000 new Denver-area residents.
   Opponents, including several environmental groups, have called
the project the biggest ecological disaster in Colorado history.
   ``It appears the Godzilla of water projects has met its match,''
said Dan Luecke, director of the Boulder-based Environmental
Defense Fund.
   Lee DeHihns, the EPA deputy regional administrator from Atlanta
who reviewed the project, said he would recommend that it be vetoed
because its ``adverse impact'' on fishery, wildlife and recreation
areas ``would be so significant that these resources would be lost
forever.''
   The final decision will be made at EPA headquarters in
Washington, D.C., but DeHihns has said vetoes are rarely overturned.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly's designee LuJuana Wilcher, the
agency's assistant administrator for water, has 60 days to affirm,
deny or modify DeHihns' decision unless an extension is granted.
   Asked at a news conference if the project is now effectively
dead, DeHihns replied, ``Nothing is dead until the fat lady sings,
as they say. LuJuana is not fat ... but she will make the final
decision.''
   DeHihns said in his recommendation he is convinced the project
would cause unacceptable environmental damage, including the
flooding of a trout stream and the loss of high-quality habitat
that is home to deer, elk and bighorn sheep.
   The EPA says there were several alternatives for providing water
to Denver's metropolitan area without causing as much environmental
damage. Those include smaller dams, water exchanges, conservation
measures and increased use of groundwater.
   Bill Miller, manager of the Denver Water Department, described
DeHihns' recommendation as ``no surprise'' and said water officials
planned to ``seek consultation at the Washington level with the
decision-maker back there.''
   The dam, estimated to cost between $500 million and $1 billion,
was proposed by the Denver Water Board and about 42 metropolitan
water suppliers as the solution to the area's future water needs.
   Last March, Reilly announced his intention to veto the project
and appointed DeHihns to oversee the final review of the project
and to make a final recommendation on its fate.
   Sen. Bob Kerry, D-Neb., said DeHihns' decision ``means we will
have to conserve as well as develop in the future.''
   ``With the EPA's decision to continue the veto process, Two
Forks is about to return to the obscurity it so richly deserves,''
said Luecke.

   Thousands of Nigerians signed up Monday to
become members of two political parties created by the military
government to return Africa's most populous nation to civilian rule.
   Popular response during the 40-day party registration that began
Monday will show the feelings of Nigerians. Many were shocked when
President Ibrahim Babangida in October rejected nominations from 13
groups seeking to register as political parties.
   Instead, the general's government itself created two political
parties, the center-right National Republican Convention and
left-leaning Social Democratic Party. The government is also
writing their platforms.
   Babangida said all 13 rejected organizations were tainted by the
corruption and ethnic and religious factionalism that he blames for
the failure of previous civilian governments.
   Soldiers have governed Nigeria by force for all but nine years
of the West African nation's 29 years of independence from Britain.
Babangida's 6-year-old government has promised to return the nation
to civilian rule through elections by 1992.
   Government critics say people are uninterested in voting for
parties created by the military.
   The government countered those charges Monday by publishing
results of a survey saying Nigerians are enthusiastic about their
evolving political system and keen to register as party members.
   Thousands lined up to register Monday, but no exact figures were
available immediately.
   All former politicians and leading government members are banned
from seeking office in this country of 115 million.
   But Information Minister Tony Momoh said Monday that some are
plotting to ensure their hold on power, for example through
surrogates on their payroll. Newspapers have been filled with
advertisements from politicians announcing which party they support.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday
denied a claim by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that he
recently said he does not recognize Poland's western border.
   Thatcher's contention, made in an interview with the Hamburg
magazine Der Spiegel, apparently has created tension in relations
between the two NATO allies just days before their summit in
Cambridge, England.
   The latest edition of Der Spiegel quoted Mrs. Thatcher as
saying: ``I have heard Helmut say: `No, I won't guarantee anything,
I don't recognize the current borders.'''
   Mrs. Thatcher said Kohl made the remark at a recent meeting of
European Economic Community leaders in Strasbourg.
   But Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said Mrs. Thatcher's
interpretation of the chancellor's remarks ``is correct neither
literally nor in a general way.''
   Klein did not disclose what Kohl actually said, but pointed out
that the chancellor in ``countless statements'' has said Germans
have no designs on lands ceded to Poland after the Third Reich's
defeat in 1945.
   It wasn't the first time Kohl has come under fire for his
statements about Poland's western border.
   Last month, he angered Poland and raised concerns around the
world by declining to give assurances that a united Germany would
not lay claim to any Polish territory.
   Kohl, under pressure from arch-conservative voters with federal
elections coming up in December, said at the time that only the
government of a united Germany could address that issue.
   He has since reversed himself, however. On March 1, Parliament
passed a resolution proposed by Kohl's party saying a united
Germany must sign a border treaty with Warsaw.
   Poland, however, contends that is still not an ironclad
guarantee of its western border.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been among those who have openly voiced
concern about German unification.
   In the Der Spiegel interview, she was quoted as saying: ``We
just have to get used to the idea that there will be a country in
Europe in the future that will be more powerful than all the
others.''
   Despite the public tiff between Kohl and Thatcher, Klein said
plans have not been changed for their Friday meeting in Cambridge.

<HEAD>Four Tories Rebel Against Thatcher's Party, 35 Abstain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, in trouble with voters over an unpopular new tax, ran
into new problems early Tuesday when four Tories defected on a vote
over subsidies to cushion the levy.
   An estimated 35 other Conservatives abstained.
   The House of Commons vote followed a late-night debate on the
subsidies. The motion drawn up by the socialist opposition Labor
Party was defeated by 305 votes to 233.
   It was the second revolt by Tory rebels in two weeks. On March
13, 33 Conservatives voted with Labor on an opposition motion _
later defeated on a second vote _ that called for more government
help for people in retirement homes.
   The motion Tuesday called for rejection of government plans to
spend $1.3 billion over the next three years to help 7{ million
low-income people pay the new tax.
   Labor legislators said the subsidies are too low. They said they
are based on what Mrs. Thatcher's government considers local
authorities should charge under the new tax, not what they are
actually charging.
   Critics say the new tax is unfair because it takes no account of
people's ability to pay.
   Recent opinion polls show the Conservatives trailing Labor by up
to 28 percentage points, with the next general election due by
mid-1992. Voters say the new tax is their main complaint with the
Conservatives.

<TEXT>
   Two pipe bombs exploded early Monday at
the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and three others were
detonated by a military bomb squad in what the campus security
director called a ``a dangerous prank.''
   No one was injured and no major damages reported, police said.
   ``The pipe bombs were fairly powerful,'' said Director of Campus
Security Dale Florian. ``They were certainly dangerous.''
   The bombs exploded at 4 a.m. and sent a metal end cap rocketing
about 150 feet through a window of the Fine Arts Building about 40
feet above the ground, Florian said. Other shrapnel was found
several hundred feet away, he said.
   The bombs went off at an ice arch in front of Rasmuson Library
where they had been placed in holes in the arch, Florian said.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it was a prank
that went awry,'' he said.
   Officials said the ice structure, built by members of the
student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, each
year becomes the target of saboteurs who try to destroy or damage
it. But Kevin Curtis, an engineering professor, called Monday's act
``a foolish extreme.''
   Florian said his office had received some leads in the case but
had no firm suspects.
   In addition to the two exploded bombs, three undetonated bombs
were found by campus security officers. A bomb squad from Eielson
Air Force Base was called in to blow up the devices, Florian said.
He described them as metal pipes filled with gunpowder set with
fuses.
   The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team from Eielson blew up the
bombs about 9 a.m., after campus police and Alaska State Troopers
evacuated about 200 people from the library and three other
buildings in the center of campus, he said.

<HEAD>Supporting Actor Award Caps Journey from TV to Big Screen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denzel Washington completed his journey from
television to the movie screen with a best supporting actor Oscar
for his role as a soldier in a black regiment in the Civil War
story ``Glory.''
   Washington becomes the fourth black performer to win an Oscar
for best actor or supporting actor.
   Washington was an Oscar nominee once before, as supporting actor
for his role as Steven Biko in Richard Attenborough's 1987 movie
``Cry Freedom,'' but he was most widely known for his role on the
TV series ``St. Elsewhere.''
   ``My son said he was going to make one of these out of clay for
me, now I've got the model for him,'' Washington said in accepting
his Academy Award at the Music Center Monday night.
   Previous black winners were Hattie McDaniel for ``Gone With the
Wind,'' in 1939 and Louis Gossett Jr. for ``An Officer and a
Gentleman'' in 1982, in supporting categories, and Sidney Poitier
for ``Lilies of the Field'' in 1963 as lead actor.
   ``Glory'' is the story of the formation of the black 54th
Regiment in the Union army during the Civil War, its soldiers'
struggle for respect and its heroic but fatal charge on a
Confederate fort in South Carolina.
   Washington played Trip, an embittered runaway slave who joins
the 54th but remains cynical about the undertaking. In one of his
most powerful scenes he tells a fellow enlisted man:
   ``Let me tell you something boy, you can march like the white
man, you can talk like him, you can learn his songs, you can even
wear his suits, but you ain't never goin' to be nothin' to him.''
   Washington concluded his thanks for the Oscar by paying homage
to the 54th, ``the black soldiers who helped to make this country
free.''
   Also nominated for supporting actor were Danny Aiello in ``Do
the Right Thing,'' Dan Aykroyd in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Marlon
Brando in ``A Dry White Season'' and Martin Landau in ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors.'

<HEAD>Report: Canceled Flights Increase 42 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 59,000 U.S. airline flights were canceled
last year, a 42 percent increase over 1988, according to a report
published Monday.
   The cancellations by 12 major carriers for non-mechanical
reasons left passengers stranded on 58,879 domestic flights in the
year ending Jan. 31, up from 41,448 for the year ending Jan. 31,
1989, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported.
   U.S. Transportation Department officials declined to discuss the
figures, which the newspaper said it obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act request.
   Of the six largest carriers, USAir had the worst record, with
both the largest number of cancellations _ 15,849 _ and the
greatest increase from the year ending Jan. 31, 1989. Its number
rose by 8,758 as it struggled through a merger last fall with
Piedmont Airlines.
   Next was American Airlines with an increase of 5,033
cancellations to 10,001, and United Airlines with an increase of
3,330 to 9,190.
   Northwest Airlines had a better record than USAir, United and
American, canceling only 1.1 percent of all flights. Its number of
cancellations dropped to 5,081 last year from 5,504 the year before.
   Officials say weather is a greater problem than it once was
because airlines are increasingly reliant on hub-and-spoke systems
that dispatch many flights from a single city.
   Bad weather at one hub can mean hundreds of added cancellations
a day, said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker. She said United's
increased cancellations were due largely to weather. But she said
some of United's trouble stems from mechanical problems that delay
the timely arrival of crews, which means canceling more flights.
   Others said United's performance during three months last summer
may have been affected by labor-contract tensions that kept crews
from reporting for duty and resulted in crew shortages.
   American Airlines did not respond to an inquiry on the matter
Friday.

<TEXT>
   Three days after the U.S.-backed
Contras signed an agreement to disband by mid-April, rebels were
streaming into Nicaragua Monday and there were reports of
intensified fighting.
   International observers and witnesses said Contra bases across
the border from Nicaragua in Yamales, Honduras, were practically
empty.
   They ``have become ghost camps. There's just a few of them left
there,'' said one international observer, who spoke on condition of
anonmity.
   Journalists who visited the camps last week had similar reports.
   The Contra leader who negotiated the demobilization pact, Oscar
Sovalbarro, said 2,000 rebel fighters have returned since the
accord was signed Friday.
   He said a 2,000-person ``insurgent military contingent is
already back in Nicaragua ... and its numbers could increase at any
moment.''
   The movement of rebel fighters into Nicaragua could undermine
hopes raised by the accord, which establishes a demobilization
deadline only for the Contras in Honduras.
   In Miami, the top Contra military commander, Israel Galeano,
insisted the fighters in Nicaragua would not disarm until the
Sandinista army does.
   ``We are speaking of total demobilization _ that includes both
ourselves and the Sandinistas,'' he said.
   Sandinista leaders have said their party will not turn over
control of the army to the new government unless the U.S.-backed
Contras demobilize.
   Galeano, who did not sign the accord, said it was unrealistic to
expect the Contras to demobilize immediately. ``An eight-year
process cannot be decided by the dismantlement of an organization
in 15 days,'' he said.
   The Defense Ministry says there have been at least two clashes
between the army and the Contras since Friday in which 16 people
died.
   The ministry also said about 100 Contras seized a truck Sunday
night, robbed the passengers of cash and jewelry and made the owner
pay a $500 ransom to get the vehicle back.
   All the incidents took place near the provincial capital of
Jinotega, 100 miles northeast of Managua on the Honduran border.
   International observers say there appears to be a split among
the Contras over the pact, but Sovalbarro and Galeano denied any
rift.
   ``At the moment we are a very solid organization. We mutually
support each other,'' Galeano said.
   Sovalbarro and a spokesman for Galeano, Alejandro Acevdeo,
denied there had been an increase in fighting and said the
Sandinistas were lying.
   ``It is the Sandinistas who are trying to undermine the peace
process. We think the Sandinistas are disguising themselves and
staging attacks to discredit us,'' Acevedo said.
   The demobilization agreement signed Friday in the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa between representatives of the rebels and of
the incoming government of the United National Opposition alliance,
or UNO, calls for an immediate cease-fire.
   It says the Contras in Honduras will demobilize by April 20,
five days before President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro takes
office.
   Most of the 12,000-man Contra army that holed up in Honduras
after U.S. military aid ended in 1988 began returning to Nicaragua
in September. As many as 4,000 were believed to be in Nicaragua by
the Feb. 25 election.
   The demobilization pact says the Contras inside Nicaragua will
move into ``secure zones'' monitored by the United Nations and
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua.
   The accord was signed by Sovalbarro _ but not by Galeano. One
foreign observer interpreted this as a loophole should Galeano,
also known as Commander Franklyn, decide not to adhere to the pact.
   ``The agreement reached with the new government of Nicaragua
surprised our combatants at first,'' Sovalbarro acknowledged. ``But
now we are all happy over what happened.''
   The observer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
appeared to be a split between Contra forces loyal to Franklyn
(Galeano) and followers of Sovalbarro (Ruben).
   ``We have estimated that Franklyn controls about 40 percent of
the Contras and Ruben about 60 percent, and that Franklyn is the
toughest of the two,'' said the observer. ``Maybe Ruben wants to
demobilize, but not Franklyn.''
   President Daniel Ortega has also said he was concerned that
Galeano had not signed the accord.
   Franklyn's brother, Osvaldo Galeano _ Commander Negro _ told The
Associated Press last week that his forces would not demobilize
unless the Sandinista army and Interior Ministry did the same.
   In the first reported clash after the pact was signed, about 100
Contras Friday ambushed an undisclosed number of Sandinistas in La
Pavona, 33 miles northeast of Jinotega. The Defense Ministry said
12 Sandinista soldiers and four Contras were killed, and eight
Sandinista soldiers and civilians were wounded in a 90-minute
firefight.
   The Defense Ministry also reported a 30-minute firefight Sunday
evening between about 30 Contras and Sandinista troops. No
casualities were reported.
   Jinotega province is the northern tip of a corridor used by the
Contras to infiltrate Nicaragua. The Contras are supported by
peasants in the corridor, a strip extending south through the
middle of Nicaragua to the Costa Rican border.

   The man charged with killing 87 people in one of
the nation's deadliest fires was a Cuban army deserter who arrived
during the 1980 Mariel boatlift and had no arrest record in New
York, authorities said Monday.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was reported to have been nonchalant when he
was arrested at his home Sunday, but later cried and blamed his
actions on the devil, police said.
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' Gonzalez told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Gonzalez, described by police as a street person who ``hustled''
money washing cars or peddling, was arraigned Monday on charges of
murdering 87 people by setting fire to the Happy Land social club
early Sunday.
   Police said Gonzalez set the fire after getting into an argument
with his 45-year-old former girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, who worked
at the club.
   He was moved Monday from the prison at Rikers island, where he
had been under a suicide watch, to maximum security protective
custody at the Brooklyn House of Detention, said prisons
spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.
   From there he was taken to Kings County Hospital for a
psychiatric evaluation. He was being held in a prison ward of the
hospital, Ryles said.
   District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez has no arrest
record in New York. He offered little other information about his
background, saying he didn't know how Gonzalez made a living or
what he has done since entering the country 10 years ago.
   ``His background is not a priority,'' Johnson said.
   Gonzalez reportedly had a job in a lamp factory in the Long
Island City section of Queens, but is believed to have been out of
work for about six months.
   According to immigration records, he arrived in the United
States at Key West, Fla., on May 31, 1980, as part of the Mariel
boatlift. About 125,000 Cubans entered the United States during
that flotilla, including many convicted criminals and other
undesirables.
   Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said Gonzalez had served ``some time'' in prison in Cuba
for deserting from the army.
   However, he said, ``In our interviews we uncovered nothing to
indicate he was criminal in nature.''
   Gonzalez, however, said at the time of his arrival that he had
told Cuban authorities he had trafficked in drugs in order to
qualify for the boatlift, Duke Austin, an INS spokesman, told The
New York Times.
   After arriving in the United States, Gonzalez was detained at
Camp McCoy, Wis., then Ft. Chaffee, Ark., until Feb. 21, 1981, when
he was granted parole status, according to Jervis.
   From Arkansas, he was sent to live with a sponsor family in New
York. ``We've had no contact from him since,'' Jervis said.
   He said Gonzalez has never applied for permanent residence,
which makes him deportable after serving time for a criminal
conviction.
   For the past three months, Gonzalez has lived in an $80-a-week
furnished room on the third floor of a house in the University
Heights section of the Bronx, near the Bronx Zoo. Before that he
had lived with the girlfriend who was employed at the Happy Land,
according to police.
   His neighbors described him as quiet, tidy and polite.
   ``He was just a normal guy. This is totally unexpected,'' Ray
Davis, the building manager, said. ``He's a nice, quiet, clean
guy.''
   ``He didn't seem to have many friends. Not many people came to
visit him. He never caused any problems or arguments,'' said Celia
Lopez, a neighbor.
   ``I still can't believe it _ to have somebody with such a
demented mind living next to me,'' said another neighbor, Yvonne
Torres.
   ``There was nothing out of the ordinary about him. We used to
shoot the breeze and drink beer,'' said Louis Rolan, another
third-floor resident.

<HEAD>ASNE Criticizes Cheney's Role in Coverage of Panama Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors on March
20 criticized Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's delay in alerting the
16-member press pool of the U.S. invasion of Panama last December.
   ``Cheney's decision to delay calling the pool until after the
close of office hours and the broadcast of the evening news made
assembling the pool difficult and actually increased the security
problem,'' said Jean Otto, chairman of the ASNE's Press-Bar-Public
Affairs Committee.
   ``It also assured that the pool would not arrive until hours
after the invasion was launched'' on Dec. 20, Otto, associate
editor of the Rocky Mountain News, said in a news release.
   The ASNE statement came as a Pentagon-sponsored report was
released saying U.S. reporters missed the start of the invasion
because Cheney decided secrecy was more important than ensuring
news coverage.
   The report also criticized Cheney's press secretary, Pete
Williams, for not trying to convince the secretary to send a group
of reporters and photographers to Panama in time to cover the
critical opening battles.
   ``I take the blame for what happened in Panama,'' Williams said
in response to the report.
   He said the Defense Department was fully committed to the idea
of allowing the news media to cover military operations, and that
steps already were being taken to correct problems described in the
latest study.
   A pool system was established by representatives of the Pentagon
and the news media after the 1983 invasion of Grenada. It is
designed to have objective observers inform American citizens from
the start of military actions involving U.S. personnel.

<HEAD>Ingersoll Newspapers To Buy Back Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. has offered to
buy back $159 million of its junk bonds at discounted prices as it
tries to meet interest payments.
   Ingersoll Newspapers, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Publications
Inc., offered March 22 to buy the bonds at between 25 percent and
55 percent of the principal amount.
   One series of bonds has been trading at about $400 per $1,000 in
face value. A separate series is trading at about $200 per $1,000.
   Ingersoll owns 19 daily newspapers in the United States and
Great Britain, and also operates a dozen groups of weekly
newspapers, most situated in the same cities as Ingersoll daily
newspapers.
   Junk bond analyst Ned Zachar of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago
said Ingersoll, like other newspaper companies in the northeastern
United States, is facing financial problems from an overall
economic slowdown. Ingersoll spokesman Mark Harnett said earnings
have fallen off.
   Zachar said bondholders should accept some kind of offer to
avoid pushing the publishing company into bankruptcy, but he
expected a higher purchase price to result from any negotiations.
   ``I think there's a pretty good chance Ingersoll will succeed
with a tender offer,'' he said. ``But whether it will be at this
price or another remains to be seen. The bondholders will likely
push for a little more.''

<HEAD>Hoiles Retires From Freedom Newspapers Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry H. Hoiles, who filed suit eight
years ago seeking a third of the assets of Freedom Newspapers Inc.,
retired from the group's board of directors March 19.
   Hoiles, 74 and a former co-publisher of The Orange County
Register, was replaced by his son, Timothy Hoiles, publisher of the
Freedom-owned Daily Press of Victorville, Calif., said Freedom
President D.R. Segal.
   Hoiles had served on the board since the early 1950s. From 1975
to 1979 he was co-publisher, with his brother Clarence, of the
Register, Freedom's flagship newspaper.
   He was publisher of the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph,
another Freedom newspaper, from 1946 to 1975. He also once served
as president of the group.
   In 1982, Hoiles sued Freedom and the families of his sister,
Mary Jane Hoiles Hardie, and his late brother, seeking a court
order giving him one-third of Freedom's assets.
   Hoiles alleged that his relatives had denied him a meaningful
management role after his brother's death in 1981, and conspired to
devalue his stock when he sought to withdraw his share of Freedom's
assets.
   An Orange County judge dismissed the suit on grounds Hoiles
failed to prove that his relatives violated corporate laws
protecting minority shareholders.
   Hoiles' appeal of the dismissal will be heard April 17.

<HEAD>New York Governor Signs Expanded `Shield Law' for News Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo expanded New York's
``shield law'' on March 24 to protect the news media from having to
surrender to the courts most information collected by reporters and
television crews.
   ``Enactment of the bill is particularly appropriate this year as
we celebrate the bicentennial of the First Amendment,'' Cuomo said
in signing the legislation. ``Since 1735, when Peter Zenger was
acquitted of libel charges, New York has led the way in the
protection of freedom of the press.''
   The Democratic governor announced his action just before
speaking at a meeting of the New York State Society of Newspaper
Editors.
   Although New York's shield law, adopted in 1970, had protected
information gathered on a confidential basis from sources, recent
state court rulings had said there was no such protection for
information gathered without a promise of confidentiality.
   Under the expanded law, unpublished information or that supplied
without a pledge of confidentiality doesn't have to be given up by
news organizations in most circumstances. A court could still order
the information divulged if it determined the material was critical
to a case and not obtainable from any alternative source.
   The legislation was passed 47-5 on March 21 by the
Republican-controlled state Senate. In January, the
Democrat-controlled Assembly had approved it 119-11.
   The legislation gives New York one of the strictest protections
for journalists of any state in the nation, according to lawyers
for several news organizations.

<HEAD>School's Carillon Tolls for Terry Anderson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa State University tolled the campus bells
60 times for Terry Anderson on March 19, one for each month the
Associated Press correspondent, a graduate of the school, has been
a hostage in the Middle East.
   Yellow ribbons were tied around trees outside the school's
Memorial Union and posters with Anderson's picture proclaimed, ``We
have not forgotten.''
   But most students, just back from spring break, went about their
business on campus without stopping as the carillon was played at
noon. Some, noticing television news crews, asked reporters,
``What's going on?''
   Anderson, a 1974 journalism and political science graduate of
ISU and a former Des Moines broadcaster, is chief Middle East
correspondent for the AP. He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16,
1985, and is the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon.
   The ISU ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of his capture
was delayed from Friday to Monday to wait for students to return to
the central Iowa campus from spring break.

<HEAD>Daily News Places Ads As Contract Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News placed advertisments seeking
applicants for mailers union jobs in the event the union strikes
after a March 30 contract expiration.
   ``New York Mailers Union No. 6 has authorized a strike against
the Daily News and we are seeking a pool of unskilled applicants
should it be necessary to hire replacements,'' the ad in March 22
editions of the Daily News read.
   ``We intend to replace all employees who do not report to work
in the event of a strike.''
   The head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella
group for 10 Daily News unions, said anyone who applied would be
wasting their time.
   ``There's no jobs for them. There's no jobs because we have
those jobs and we're not giving those jobs up,'' said George
McDonald, who is also head of the mailers union.
   ``If our employees refuse our sincere offer to work,
replacements must be hired,'' said John T. Sloan, the News' vice
president for human resources. ``This step by the News is
protection on our part against a blatant and potentially disruptive
strike by the mailers union.''
   Management says union work must be trimmed into order to return
the paper to profitability. The company says it will then spend
$300 million to $500 million on modernization.
   The unions say the News is trying to make them strike in order
to shut down the paper or sell it.

<HEAD>New York Times Company Sued Over Magazine Title</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban Cleveland company that publishes a
fashion and lifestyle magazine for distribution to shoppers filed a
$10 million lawsuit against The New York Times Company on March 21,
contending trademark rights were violated.
   Mall Network of Beachwood contends a new Family Circle
publication called NOW has the same title as that of a 3-year-old
fashion and lifestyle magazine the Ohio company publishes.
   The new Family Circle publication is variously referred to as
NOW, Fitness NOW and similar titles, the complaint said.
   Mall Network said it obtained a registered trademark for the
title NOW in 1987.
   Nancy Nielsen, spokeswoman for The New York Times Company, said
she could not comment because she had not seen the lawsuit.
   Mall Network said the first edition of the new Family Circle
publications was published Feb. 19 and the second is scheduled for
publication April 2.
   Mall Network estimated that total readership of its NOW
magazine, which is distributed in several states through shopping
malls, direct mailing and newspaper inserts, is more than 7 million
people.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Stays Order Sending Television Newsman to Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television reporter who faced jail for
refusing to reveal his sources was allowed to remain free March 20
until a federal court decides his case.
   A state district judge on Feb. 8 cited KMOL reporter Brian Karem
for contempt of court and ordered him jailed up to six months for
refusing to turn over notes from a telephone interview with capital
murder suspect Henry David Hernandez.
   Hernandez and his brother are charged in connection with the
slaying last year of a San Antonio police officer.
   Karem interviewed Hernandez while the defendant was in jail. The
newsman said he promised to protect confidential sources who helped
arrange the interview and who are identified in his notes.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys want to find out who helped
set up the interview in efforts to use or prevent the use of the
interview statements in Hernandez's capital murder trial. Hernandez
told Karem in the interview that he shot the officer in
self-defense.
   In citing Karem for contempt, State District Judge Pat Priest
said the defendant's right to a fair trial outweighed the First
Amendment right to a free press.
   Karem's attorney appealed the February ruling unsuccessfully to
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. On March 19 he filed a request
for a stay in federal court.

<HEAD>State To Intervene in Bass-Poynter Court Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth said
March 23 he will intervene in a lawsuit filed by Texas billionaire
Robert M. Bass over dividends paid to the Poynter Institute.
   Butterworth said the dispute could disrupt funding for the media
center, which runs the St. Petersburg Times and other publications.
   The attorney general said he was getting involved because he has
the constitutional authority ``to protect the integrity of
charitable interests.''
   Times Editor and President Andrew Barnes, who is also chairman
of the institute, welcomed the action. Bass questioned it.
   Butterworth said he will seek to stop an effort by
Poynter-Jamison Ventures Ltd., an investor partnership controlled
by Bass, to obtain dividends now paid to the non-profit journalism
institute.
   The Bass partnership includes the nieces of the late Eleanor
Poynter Jamison, sister of founder Nelson Poynter. It has made a
$270 million buyout offer for Times Publishing Co., parent firm of
the newspaper, Congressional Quarterly and other magazines.
   The Bass group owns 40 percent of the voting stock of Times
Publishing Co. That organization is controlled by the Times Holding
Co., which is in turn controlled by the Poynter Institute.
   Bass maintains it wants a better return on its investment, while
Times Publishing defends the current stock arrangement as
beneficial to the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the
health of the Poynter Institute.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Carrier Family's Suit Against Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sioux City Journal is not
responsible for injuries suffered by a youth who was run over by
his father's truck while delivering newspapers, the Iowa Supreme
Court ruled March 21.
   The court ordered that a suit brought by the youth against the
newspaper's parent company be dismissed. A local judge had earlier
refused to grant summary judgment for the company, which appealed
that ruling to the Supreme Court.
   The Supreme Court ruled that Francis LaFleur was not an employee
of Sioux City Newspapers Inc. when the 1978 accident occurred.
Court records show a truck driven by LaFleur struck his son, Frank,
who was 10 years old at the time and was delivering newspapers with
his father and other family members. The boy suffered severe and
disabling injuries, the court stated in its ruling.
   The ruling upheld the company's stand that the elder LaFleur was
not an employee but rather was an independent contractor at the
time of the accident. Companies are not directly responsible for
actions of independent contractors under Iowa law.

<HEAD>City Requires Signed Embargo Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's requirement that news
agencies sign an embargo agreement before obtaining an advance copy
of material for a news conference could set a dangerous precedent,
a media law specialist said.
   The mayor's office would not release an internal police report
on the custody of mob informant Peter Gilbert before the March 22
news conference unless reporters signed a lengthy embargo agreement.
   Material commonly is embargoed, but reporters are not required
to sign such contracts.
   ``To my knowledge it's unprecedented,'' said Thomas A. Schwartz,
a media law specialist at Ohio State University.
   ``Historically there has been a matter of trust between media
sources and the media,'' he said. ``But I'm sure that many media
sources have been burned in recent times and have become more
cautious in protecting the release of such material.''
   The contract acknowledged the 280-page report ``would be
considered to be a governmental record'' covered under Rhode
Island's public records law.
   City spokesman Tad Devine said the arrangement was needed
because some of those affected by the report would not have a
chance to review it before the news conference.
   The Providence Journal-Bulletin signed the agreement, but then
issued a statement saying it regretted the decision. James V.
Wyman, vice president of the newspaper, said his company would not
sign such documents in the future.

<HEAD>Media Seek to Block Cult Trial Coverage Orders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of news organizations in Cleveland
told the Ohio Supreme Court on March 19 that a northeast Ohio judge
failed to justify three orders he issued involving coverage of a
cult murder case.
   The case involves the slayings of five family members whose
bodies were found in January buried in a barn in Kirtland, about 25
miles northeast of Cleveland. Authorities suspect they were shot by
a religious cult, and 13 members of the group are accused in the
slayings.
   Judge Martin Parks of Lake County Common Pleas Court issued the
restrictions on coverage. They prohibit those in the trial from
talking to reporters, require television stations to maintain any
videotapes made in connection with the story, and prohibit
photographs of a defendant should there be a trial.
   The National Broadcasting Co., television stations WUAB, WKYC,
WEWS, WJW and The Plain Dealer of Cleveland contend the
restrictions ``directly and dramatically'' affect their
constitutional news-gathering and reporting rights.
   The Supreme Court gave no indication when it might rule.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Teachers' Suit Against Newspapers, News Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on March 17 dismissed a
libel suit a group of teachers at an eastern Kentucky high school
filed against The Associated Press and five newspapers.
   But U.S. District Judge Karl Forester denied requests for
dismissal of a related defamation lawsuit against the news service
and one of the newspapers, brought by a teacher named in a 1988 AP
article.
   John H. O'Brien, principal of Phelps High School, and 28 faculty
members contended the AP story about a parents meeting defamed them
and permanently damaged their reputations.
   Teacher Gary R. Hunt filed a separate suit in which he claimed
the story and expanded version in the Williamson (W.Va.) Daily News
defamed his reputation and violated his right to privacy.
   Forester acted on a report filed in early February by U.S.
Magistrate Joseph Hood. In his report, Hood said the teachers
failed to prove their claims of being libeled as a group.
   Forester also adopted Hood's recommendation that the newspapers
that printed only the AP story be removed from the Hunt case. Hood
said the editors had no reason to suspect the article was
``anything other than an accurate account of a public meeting and
remarks made therein.''
   Dismissed from the Hunt suit were The (Louisville)
Courier-Journal, the Lexington Herald-Leader, The Daily Independent
of Ashland and the Appalachian News-Express of Pikeville. The AP
and the Williamson Daily News remain as defendants in the Hunt suit.

the trial, telling a defense attorney that similar negative press
didn't prevent one-time Miss America Bess Myerson's acquittal.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan made the comment in the
second day of jury selection at the trial of Mrs. Marcos and Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   Outside the presence of would-be jurors, Mrs. Marcos' lawyer,
Gerry Spence, told Keenan that he was concerned about publicity. He
read from a New York Daily News column about Mrs. Marcos headlined
``Last of the Red-Hot Evil Women.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of participating in the illegal
transfer of more than $160 million from the Philippines treasury to
buy Manhattan real estate, and of defrauding banking institutions
of another $165 million to finance the deals.

   A man acquitted in 1986 of molesting his
young daughter was awarded more than $5 million in damages March 19
for being defamed by members of the audience at Geraldo Rivera's
talk show.
   U.S. District Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry entered a default
judgment granting Lawrence Spiegel $1 million in special damages
and $4 million in punitive damages.
   Spiegel's attorney, Stephen Haft, said Faye Yeager of Atlanta
and Lydia Rayner of Gulfport, Miss., defendants in the 1988 federal
slander suit, failed to file answers or appear at the hearing.
   Haft said his client was a guest on the nationally televised
show in 1988 when the defendants _ wearing wigs and sunglasses _
began berating Spiegel from the audience.
   He said the women, who are associated with the national group
Mothers Against Raping Children, had previously harassed Spiegel
during a speaking engagement in California.
   Spiegel was indicted in December 1983 on charges of molesting
his then-2-year-old daughter. He was cleared of the charges in
January 1986.
   ``If nothing else, I hope this sends the message that I will not
be a punching bag for anyone,'' Spiegel, a psychologist from
Parsippany-Troy Hills, said of the judge's decision.
   There was no immediate comment available from Ms. Yeager in

   Roffman said Trump forced the company to make him issue a letter

   Roffman said he later had second thoughts and faxed another

   Bostonia is subsidized by the university and is distributed free

   Keith Botsford, who was appointed publisher and editor-in-chief

not to write about local politics.
   Botsford said it would be illegal for the magazine to take sides
because the university is a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation.
   ``I would have done it if it was about Evelyn Murphy or anyone

   ``I expect to take a beating in the press for this. It will look

   Human rights advocate Natan Sharansky
criticized Israel's censorship of reports on Soviet immigration,
saying it was hurting efforts to settle the new arrivals.
   Sharansky, a former Soviet refusnik, was joined by an official
of a resettlement agency in complaining about excessive censorship
March 20.
   The ban on publication of immigration figures was imposed March
1 amid mounting Arab protests the influx could lead to more Jewish
settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, home
to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Sharansky, who heads the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, said some
self-censorship might be needed to ensure the security of the
immigrants.
   But he said, ``We need more support from world Jewry and, to
make bureaucrats work more effectively, we need more public
pressure. We can't do it under conditions of censorship.''
   Sharansky and other Israeli activists have said the Jewish state
is not preparing enough housing and jobs for the arriving Soviets.

   The chairman of Poland's largest press
cooperative said March 21 the Solidarity-led government had acted
unfairly in deciding that it be liquidated.
   Under Communist rule, the Workers' Publishing Cooperative
muzzled unauthorized publications. On March 19, the Cabinet decided
to do away with the group because it was seen as an organ of the
now-defunct Communist Party.
   Parliament must still pass the law dismantling the group.
   Slawomir Tabkowski, chairman of the cooperative, said the
government commission that developed the law had submitted to
``neo-Bolshevik pressure'' aimed at attaining ``political revenge.''
   He said the cooperative had gotten only a brief chance to
display its plans to reform itself, and the government had made an
arbitrary decision.
   The cooperative published the vast majority of newspapers on the
market, controlled the sale of newspapers through its monopoly on
more than 20,000 kiosks in the country and owned several important
publishing houses.
   Last year, the popularity of the cooperative's publications
began to drop as new independent newspapers emerged in Poland's

   President Samuel Doe decided to remove the ban in honor of
Namibia's independence that day, according to a Ministry of
Information statement. The southern African nation became
independent after 75 years of white South African rule.
   Footprints Today and Sun Times newspapers were banned in April
1988, when the government also barred radio stations from
broadcasting reports of the British Broadcasting Corp. and the
U.S.-funded Voice of America.
   Footprints Today was accused of fabricating a letter to the
editor signed by an alleged army officer who said secret killings
and arrests were increasing in Liberia.
   Offending stories in the Sun Times reported the arrest of a
Ghanaian for possession of explosives and the firing of the
commander of a government anti-terrorist squad.
   ELCM community radio was ordered closed in June 1989 for
reporting one person was crushed to death and hundreds were injured

<HEAD>Glasnost May Come at a Cost for East German Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the biggest players in West German
journalism have begun selling magazines and newspapers in East
Germany.
   Eastern publishers knew when the government of Erich Honecker
fell in October that ``we'd be faced with free-market competition,
that we'd have to adopt more competitive practices,'' said Matthias
Schlegel, deputy editor of the daily Neue Zeit.
   His newspaper, with a circulation of 150,000 and a price of 20
pfennigs (12 cents) has survived only with state support.
   ``We're worried we won't be able to survive economically,''
Schlegel said. ``It's a real question for our existence,'' he said.
   Early this month West German publishers put street vendors to
work in a major East Berlin plaza selling such journals as the
mass-circulation Bild Zeitung, conservative daily Die Welt, news
magazines Der Spiegel and Stern, and a wide range of fashion and
sports magazines.
   The Western publications can be expensive. Under a typical
pricing formula Der Spiegel would cost 13.50 East marks, the
equivalent of $7.65.
   Schlegel said there may be a spate of takeovers by West German
press barons jockeying for market position, and that small regional
or local papers might be targets.
   Other changes: The East German news agency ADN, which surprised
Western journalists with its rapid change to fast, reliable
reporting, is said to be planning a merger with the West German
agency DPA. And Tageszeitung, a West German tabloid, has set up in
East Berlin to print a separate Eastern edition.

   A Hollywood studio representative and NBC-TV
exchanged verbal brickbats March 23 over a network program dealing
with a ``new'' Hollywood where small producers are likely to get
squashed by large competitors.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he was outraged over NBC's ``The New Hollywood,''
broadcast March 21.
   Valenti said NBC failed to disclose its own efforts in
Washington to wrest back control of its programs from Hollywood
producers.
   Tom Brokaw, who anchored the program, called Valenti's attack an
insult to his journalistic integrity.
   Valenti, in a letter to NBC President Robert Wright, demanded a
opportunity, in television prime time, to ``present a rebuttal to
NBC's lack of disclosure.''
   NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge said Valenti's demand was ``idiotic.
That means no.''
   Hollywood producers, including the major studios that make up
the MPAA, have been involved in negotiations for seven years over
federal rules that prevent ABC, NBC and CBS from having a financial
interest in the programs they broadcast or from selling those
programs in the lucrative U.S. rerun market.
   Valenti emphasized that he was not questioning Brokaw's

be made in response to political upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   The review will examine the radio programs of the Voice of
America and of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, according to a
March 21 letter from National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``The President strongly shares your view that the dramatic
opening of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union requires us to look
afresh at all our broadcasting activities,'' Scowcroft wrote Rep.
Dante Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The stations have already begun changing, including new emphasis
on ``how-to'' programs that instruct listeners in one-time
communist countries about life in the Western world.

<HEAD>Castro Speech Disrupts U.S. Radio Transmissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Havana radio speech by Cuban President Fidel
Castro was picked up on at least six AM radio frequencies in
Florida March 23 in what may be a prelude to a cold-war battle over
U.S.-financed TV Marti.
   The Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma mentioned in its
March 23 editions that Castro's remarks would be broadcast toward
the United States that evening.
   WYFX in Delray Beach was one of the stations affected.
   ``I have been getting some feedback over the air,'' said disc
jockey Lorenzo Fox. ``You hear some kind of broadcast coming
through.''
   Other stations, such as Spanish-language WQBA in Miami and WVCG
in Coral Gables, responded to the interference by boosting their
signal.
   Others were not seriously affected because they are normally off
the air at night.
   TV Marti is expected to begin within weeks. The Cuban government
has threatened to jam U.S. broadcast transmissions if the
television service is beamed toward Cuba.

<HEAD>FCC Narrows HDTV Field</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on March
21 further narrowed the field of contestants seeking to market a
high-definition television transmission system.
   Chairman Alfred Sikes said the FCC voted to consider only
systems that will not require use of an extra ``augmentation''
channel.
   Only so-called simulcast systems will be considered for testing
at the Advanced Television Test Center this fall, Sikes said.
   In a simulcast system, a TV station would broadcast its regular
signal on one channel and the same program on another channel in
high-definition.
   Augmentation systems also use two channels, but use the second
channel to provide a signal that, when combined in the TV set with
the regular signal on the first channel, yields the high-definition
picture.
   Peter Fannon, executive director of the test center, said five
entrants have been accepted for the test so far: Sarnoff-Philips;
an analog simulcast system from Philips; Zenith Electronics Corp.;
and the narrow MUSE and MUSE-6 systems from the Japan Broadcasting
Corp.

<HEAD>ABC To Show Fewer Commercials in Premiere of New Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC said March 21 it plans to show 20 percent
fewer commercials when its new ``Twin Peaks'' series premieres as a
two-hour special on April 8.
   The decision could cost the network up to $650,000. Spokeswoman
Janice Gretemeyer said ABC had considered airing the special
without commercials to draw attention to the series created by
filmmaker David Lynch.
   But it decided that would have been too expensive, and chose
instead to cut back on commercials, she said. The premiere will
have 11 minutes and 12 seconds of commercials instead of the usual
14 minutes for Sunday movies.
   Richard Kostrya, an executive vice president of the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency, estimated that ABC's decision could
cost the network from $600,000 to $650,000. The network did not
provide an estimate.
   The series, set in the Pacific Northwest, is described by ABC as
a ``sometimes darkly comic vision'' of commonplace things and
events.
   Lynch is known for such dark works as the movie ``Blue Velvet.''

   ABC is refusing to run a yogurt commercial made

did their job too well.
   In the Yoplait commercial produced by W.B. Doner &amp; Co., a
television reporter tells viewers in a no-nonsense staccato, ``The

   The woman, identified as a ``Frozen Yogurt Reporter,''
interviews a police detective who is dusting empty yogurt cartons
for tongue prints. ``These cartons were licked clean,'' the
detective says.
   Janet Gretemeyer, ABC's director of press relations, said, ``The
Yoplait yogurt ad contains simulated news techniques. Such
representations are reserved specifically for actual news
broadcasts.''
   CBS asked for a disclaimer explaining that the commercials are
not actual news. NBC does not want to run the spot during news
broadcasts.
   The Baltimore advertising agency said it was adding the line,
``Sponsored by Yoplait,'' to the start of each 30-second commercial
to avoid confusion.
   The $3 million campaign began airing March 19 on major cable

   The setting is a tiny Pittsburgh
restaurant a month after the death of Martin Luther King Jr., but
August Wilson's latest work in his cycle of plays about black
America is not about the turbulent 1960s.
   ``People have written so much about the '60s, so I didn't need
to do that. I went at it obliquely,'' said Wilson, whose play,
``Two Trains Running,'' premieres March 30 at the Yale Repertory
Theater.
   In his fifth collaboration with director Lloyd Richards, the
acclaimed playwright returns to a dominant theme in all his works:
To have a future, blacks in America must first define who they are
by reclaiming their past.
   ``Unless you reconnect to your past, make some accommodation to
your past, fully understand your history in the world, you can't
have a future,'' said the 44-year-old Wilson.
   ``Two Trains Running,'' its title taken from a blues song of the
same name, is filled with references to death. One of the
restaurant's patrons is an undertaker, whose funeral parlor is
across the street. As the characters talk about the conditions of
their lives, Wilson said, ``what you find is people are dying.
Infant mortality rates are high, police are shooting people, drugs
are killing people. Everyone is dying young.
   ``Quickly what you discover is that the real problem is the
economic problem. There simply are not any jobs for any of these
people in Pittsburgh in 1968. You could have written the same thing
for the 1980s. Things haven't changed at all. They have actually
got worse.''
   Wilson was born in Pittsburgh but has lived in St. Paul, Minn.,
since 1978.
   In the play, everything seems to be working against Memphis, the
restaurant owner, and the other characters. Memphis is a former
sharecropper who was run out of Mississippi in 1931 and whose
restaurant is about to be torn down.
   But in the middle of all this loss and death is that which does
not die _ tradition. The main characters tap into that by going to
see Aunt Esther, a woman who claims to be 322 years old.
   Aunt Esther, an offstage character, ``will make you right with
your self,'' said Wilson, who with his raspy smoker's voice
frequently draws from the play's dialogue to illustrate a point.
   ``Aunt Esther tells Memphis if he drops the ball, there is no
need to continue to run because if you get to the end zone there is
not going to be a touchdown. You've got to go back and pick up the
ball. Each of the characters gets the same message. You've got to
go back and claim what is yours before you can go forward.''
   At a meat market next to the funeral home, a man walks in and
tells the owner, ```I want my ham.' He says, `take a chicken.' For
the past nine years every morning this guy has been showing up. For
me that represents black America standing patiently outside the
door of American society in 1968 and prior to that. I want my ham.
I want my ham,'' Wilson said.
   While ``Two Trains Running'' is set in the '60s, Wilson's other
major works have addressed issues facing American blacks during
other decades of this century. All have premiered at Yale, with
Richards directing. The theatrical partnership began in 1984 with
``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' (1920s), and continued with ``Fences''
(1950s), ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' (1910-20) and ``The Piano
Lesson'' (1930s), which opens on Broadway on April 16.
   Wilson won a Tony and the Pulitzer Prize for ``Fences.''
Richards received a Tony for best director for the play. Wilson
also won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for three of his
plays.
   With Richards' tenure as dean of the Yale School of Drama and
artistic director at the Yale Rep ending in June 1991, ``Two
Trains'' could be the last of Wilson's plays to have its premiere
at Yale. But Wilson said it definitely will not be their last
collaboration: ``Wherever he goes, that's where I'm going.''
   The collaboration has made his string of plays seem seamless, he
said. ``They are all the same in the sense you have the same
artistic sensibilities working on the play.
   ``We've developed over the course of the years a kind of
shorthand way of working. There is not a lot of talking that goes
on.''
   Wilson believes he is getting better with each play he writes.
He said myth and ritual are also growing to be larger elements,
citing the tall tale of the 3-century-old woman as an example.
   ``I've learned a lot about building characters. I know what is
important now,'' he said.

   Opposition political leaders, like opposition
vegetables, often are known by the enemies they keep.
   Broccoli and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri share the
perfect critic. President Bush doesn't care for either of them.
   There is no better way to raise a profile than to have the
president of the United States slap it. Broccoli was something most
people didn't think about, let alone talk about, until Bush
disclosed his distaste. Now a truckload of the stuff has come to
Washington and talk of broccoli is part of the fare on late-night
television.
   Gephardt, the House majority leader, has become a prime
Democratic debater against Bush's policies, and one reason is the
president's sharp personal rebuttal. Gephardt seems to irk Bush
more than other Democrats do, even when the messages are similar.
   While the president said Gephardt doesn't get under his skin, he
complained after a tax debate last year that the Missouri
congressman had made it all too personal. The administration
mounted a public counterattack when Gephardt gave a speech
criticizing Bush as lacking in vision and leadership at a time of
crucial change in Eastern Europe.
   ``But I don't want to knock the man, maybe he'll come up with a
good idea one of these days,'' Bush said.
   Gephardt said he doesn't know why his speeches seem to rankle
Bush. ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I have tried not to make
personal attacks. I like him personally. I hope he's a good
president.''
   ``I didn't do this to get into a fight or a name-calling
contest,'' Gephardt said in an interview. But he said there needs
to be debate about Bush's ``vision-less foreign policy'' and
economic issues at home. Gephardt said only a president can provide
national leadership, and Bush isn't doing it.
   Gephardt said he doubted the dispute with the White House had
done much to raise his personal visibility level. He wryly recalled
his early exit from candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, and said not many people recognize him yet. He said on
the rare occasions when people know his face in airports or
restaurants, they think he is Jack Kemp or Dan Quayle.
   That may be, but a presidential rebuke can be a political merit
badge that boosts a congressional figure or a candidate in the
opposition party.
   The classic case came in 1966, when Richard M. Nixon was trying
to make his way back to Republican leadership after his losing
campaigns for the White House and for governor of California. He
went on the road for Republican congressional candidates,
criticizing the policies of Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Nixon's quest got a major boost after he criticized Johnson's
Vietnam war policy, drawing a bitter counterattack. Johnson said he
didn't want to debate ``a chronic campaigner like Mr. Nixon.'' He
called Nixon a loser, a man willing to confuse Americans about
Vietnam policy, even risk soldiers' lives, to pick up a few votes.
   Nixon replied with wounded patriotism, other Republican figures
including Dwight D. Eisenhower came to his defense, and the
presidential diatribe made him the designated hitter for the GOP
opposition. The party made him its spokesman in a half-hour network
television speech, and he was a major beneficiary in the sweeping
Republican comeback that year. It was one of the landmark points in
Nixon's own comeback to the presidential election victory of 1968.
   The Bush-Gephardt dispute is far tamer. Then again, it isn't
over yet. There are those who say that Gephardt nettles the White
House by arguing economic issues on a class basis, rich against
middle class and poorer Americans.
   He means to keep up the debate. ``I think that's what's supposed
to happen ina democracy,'' the majority leader said.
   Incidentally, Gephardt likes broccoli.

   In Panama, women piloted Strategic Air Command tankers that
refueled the planes flying troops and supplies from the United
States.
   They dodged bullets and artillery fire as they ferried troops
into battle aboard Blackhawk helicopters _ with two female pilots
nominated for the prestigious Air Medal with a bronze V for valor,
the first women to be so honored.
   Despite these advances, the confusion that struck the five-star
Soviet general when he faced Lt. Lipphardt seems to afflict many
military and political leaders in this country as well, when it
comes to the idea of women as warriors.
   But there's no doubt in Lipphardt's mind. She's allowed to fly
planes to and from aircraft carriers with mail, people and
supplies, but can't be based on the warships as a jet pilot because
that would be combat duty.
   Now, without a chance to go after the toughest piloting job she
thinks the Navy could hand her _ coupled with other problems such
as lengthy separations from her submariner husband _ Lipphardt says
she's thinking of leaving the service.
   ``If the ban against combat flying were dropped, maybe I'd feel
differently,'' she says.
   In a report last fall to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, the
Pentagon's Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services
said, ``The services can ill afford to continue to limit these
women and their experiences in the face of the anticipated manpower
shortages of the 1990s.''
   By comparing sheer statistics, women seem to fare best in the
Air Force.
   The service's high-tech, long-distance weaponry allows for 97
percent of its specialities to be open to women, with 13.6 percent
of its force being female.
   Women are barred from serving in fighters, bombers, tactical
airlift cargo planes and some helicopters, but they are allowed to
fly in some transport aircraft, in command-post aircraft, on
reconnaisance aircraft and on support missions.
   The Air Force recently lifted the restrictions against women
flying on C-130 and C-141 transports that drop paratroopers into
battle zones.
   The Army is 11.4 percent female. The advertising directed at
recruiting women boasts that more than 93 percent of its
specialities are open to women. Given the service's high combat
needs, however, this translates to about half of its job slots
being closed to women.
   The Army, after more than a year of indecision, still hasn't
decided what to do with some 345 women who've been trained as field
artillery officers, but who've been pulled from their jobs amid
worries that the positions would be too exposed to enemy fire.
   The Navy, at a 9.9 percent female level, bars women from serving
on all aircraft carriers except one _ the USS Lexington, a training
ship. While combat vessels such as destroyers and cruisers are also
off-limits, women do serve at sea on support ships such as oilers
and tenders that supply aircraft carriers, submarines and other
fighting vessels.
   The Marine Corps has the smallest percentage of slots open to
women _ 4.8 percent. Marine Corps officials point out that because
the service relies on the Navy for medical care the Marines don't
have a large number of nurses _ a traditionally female specialty in
the armed services.
   Questions about the future role of women in the military have
grown sharper, not only because of the attention focused on the
hundreds of women who participated in the Panama invasion but also
because of the extensive personnel cuts the Pentagon faces in light
of the nation's budget woes and the end of the Cold War.
   Two congresswomen say they want to ensure that military women
don't suffer disproportionately under the manpower cuts that seem
virtually certain with the easing of East-West tension.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., has introduced legislation
that would allow Army women to apply for all positions, including
combat-related slots.
   ``Polls show seven out of 10 Americans think women should have a
chance to serve in combat units if they want to,'' Ms. Schroeder
says. ``It's a really touchy issue ... But we've had women die in
combat, and I think the American people are aware of what that
means.''
   Rep. Beverly Bryon, D-Md., chairman of the House Armed Services
subcommittee on military personnel, says that while more job
categories should be open to women, she opposes the idea of them
entering combat units.
   ``We're moving along at a pace I'm comfortable with,'' Mrs.
Byron says.
   The service academies _ West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force
Academy _began graduating women only 10 years ago, so few have had
time to reach the higher, decision-making ranks of the military.
   At the end of last year, only seven women held the rank of
general or admiral.
   ``We're still in the process of aging the officer corps,'' says
Foote. ``It's going to take us a while to get women where they can
make more than just token changes in the way the military is run.''

   Here are some comments from and about women in
the U.S. armed forces:

   ``I couldn't tote a 100-pound rucksack and walk for miles, but I
can fly,'' says Army Capt. Alice Reinwald of Columbus, Ga., on duty
near the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
   The 28-year-old woman pilots a Blackhawk helicopter and is in
charge of administration at Camp LaGuardia, an Army outpost 14
miles from the DMZ. The post is home to the 250 soldiers who make
up the attack helicopter battalions based there.
   ``If we have to take off and go to war today, I'd have to be a
pilot. We'd fly support, we'd be right in there, going to the front
lines with whatever is needed _ food, fuel, supplies,'' Reinwald
says.
   She says she knows ``there are limitations'' to what a woman can
do.
   It's because of such limitations that her husband, an infantry
officer, doesn't want women fighting alongside his men in the
trenches and gullies of South Korea.
   ``I know he just wouldn't feel comfortable with the idea,'' she
says.

   Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, the commander of the 18th Airborne
Corps, says the 600 women who participated in the invasion of
Panama ``were all over the place'' during the fighting.
   ``I'm just as proud of the women as I am of the men,'' he says.
Asked if women could have shouldered 100-pound rucksacks and jumped
with the paratroopers, he responds, ``There are some that can.''

   Lt. Yolandea Wood, the crew chief aboard a KC-135 tanker that
refueled planes heading southward for the Panama invasion, says she
doesn't deserve any attention just because she's a woman.
   ``I'm not any more special than the guys. We all trained hard
and it paid off. I'm a crew member just like the others,'' says the
young officer based at Grissom Air Force Base in Indiana.

   Marine Capt. Ellen Febonio watched closely as her female charges
in officer candidate school tried to learn how to take a hill
alongside their male counterparts one cold day at the Marine Corps
training ground at Quantico, Va.
   From the rear, it was hard to tell the men from the women as the
bulky, camouflaged bodies wormed their way up the muddy grade slope
with rifles in hand.
   ``The women are able to train now. When I started, we'd just
follow the men and watch what they'd do,'' Febonio said.

   Army Lt. Lisa Kutschera, nominated for the Air Medal with a
bronze V for flying troops into battle in Panama under severe fire,
says, ``It takes a special kind of courage, but it's my job.
   ``Before I entered the military, I resolved in my own mind that
some day I might have to go into combat, regardless of the
combat-exclusion law. I was willing to go because I'd already
resolved it in my own mind ... Yeah, it was combat.''

   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Jean Cackowski, now the executive officer on the
oiler USS Platte, trained at the Navy's Surface Warfare School.
   She was aboard the USS Dixie, a repair ship that was deployed to
the Indian Ocean and became the first ship with women sent to the
Navy's super-secret base at Diego Garcia.
   Her next assigment was on the Navy's training aircraft carrier,
the USS Lexington, where she was the first woman to qualify as the
officer of the deck and the surface warfare officer on such a
vessel.
   ``I'd prefer to be on a ship that can shoot back,'' she says.

   The world's two most powerful economies have
become inextricably wedded. But too often the relationship between
the United States and Japan seems like a bad marriage characterized
by frequent spats. What do the two have in common apart from money?
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Never mind trade tensions. At Sam Kusumoto's
company, a recent office party was enough to put a crimp in
U.S.-Japan relations.
   There wasn't an argument or even a minor contretemps at the
affair. Many of the American employees just didn't show up. It
seems they didn't know about it in time, explains Kusumoto,
president of Minolta USA in suburban Ramsey, N.J.
   ``At Japanese companies, we have very nice horizontal
communication,'' he says. ``Everybody listens to what the other guy
is talking about over the phone. After office hours we associate.''
   So plans for just about everything spread chattily through the
ranks _ in Japanese, of course. Formal notice, American-style, is
almost an afterthought.
   ``The Americans didn't hear about the party,'' Kusumoto says.
``And when they discovered the date was decided months ago they got
upset.''
   A simple miscue, but behind it lay a gulf of misunderstanding
that somehow has defied nearly 50 years of U.S.-Japan amity and
more than a century of cultural exchange since 19th century Japan,
under American prodding, cast off its feudal kosode (robes).
   Today more than ever, the world's two most powerful economies
have become inextricably wedded. But too often the relationship
seems like a bad marriage characterized by frequent squabbles and
little in common apart from money.
   The tensions have appeared in numerous forms, despite the best
efforts of both sides to avoid them: in charges of discrimination
by American employees of Japanese companies, in a hardhearted new
appraisal by Washington of its one-time protege, and vice versa.
And not least, in an undercurrent of racism.
   The racism often surfaces subtly. When Japanese companies
purchasedsuch American corporate icons as Columbia Pictures and New
York's Rockefeller Center last year, the headlines often read ``The
Japanese Buy ...,'' as if the entire nation were bent,
samurai-like, on the takeover.
   In contrast, other major foreign purchasers _ British, Canadian,
Dutch _have been described more accurately as individual companies.
   Part of it is the sheer cultural impact of Japan's new wealth,
an economic sea change that made Japan the world's largest creditor
by the end of the 1980s, and its former patron, the United States,
the largest debtor.
   ``It's the Japanese rate of buying that's frightening,'' says
Marlene Rossman, a New York-based consultant to New York companies.
   Japan is now second only to Great Britain in U.S. investments.
From May 1987 to last May, the number of U.S. factories with at
least partial Japanese ownership nearly doubled from 550 to 1,043,
according to the Japan External Trade Organization.
   Japan's total investment in U.S. real estate, corporations and
subsidiaries soared from $4.7 billion in 1980 to $53.4 billion in
1988, according to the most recent Commerce Department figures.
Japanese companies now hold about 50 percent of the commercial real
estate in downtown Los Angeles, more than 20 prime properties in
Manhattan, including Tiffany's, and substantial holdings in
Washington.
   It is not over the issue of Washington real estate, however, but
closer to the heart of the nation's capital that U.S.-Japanese
tensions have perhaps cut deepest.
   Particularly irksome were the 1989 trade figures released in
February. The United States enjoyed a $1.5 billion surplus with the
12-nation European Community, a sharp turnaround from a $9.2
billion deficit in 1988. But with Japan, despite a sharp decline in
the dollar engineered to help U.S. exports, the deficit was a
stubborn $49 billion.
   That was no appreciable improvement from the previous year's
$51.8 billion deficit with Japan, even with an 18 percent increase
in U.S. export sales, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary for
international trade in the Commerce Department.
   The trade frictions are aggravated by what many in Congress and
the Bush administration see as the Japanese government's xenophobic
resistance to open markets and cultural disposition to treat trade
as economic warfare.
   ``The fallacy in asking the Japanese to open their markets is
they haven't got the foggiest idea what an open market is,'' says
Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department negotiator whose
influential 1988 book, ``Trading Places,'' portrayed Japan as
having carefully planned its export-fueled ascendancy.
   In Tokyo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said U.S.
analysts were wrong in arguing that Japan's culture was an
unchangeable barrier to concepts like an open market. On March 22,
U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators reported a breakthrough over
the key issue of opening supercomputer exports to Japan.
   In addition, experts point out, Japan has been moving from an
export-based to a domestic market-based economy.
   Japan has a long history of adapting foreign ideas, Watanabe
said, ``and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so.''
   One reason, however, is that the Japanese are not as keen on
foreign ideas these days, an attitude born of Japan's pride in its
postwar ``miracle'' and a growing contempt for the United States'
persistent problems.

   According to a Business Week poll released Dec. 7 _ Pearl Harbor
Day _ more than half of the Japanese don't have much or any
admiration for the United States, its economic success or its
people.
   A recent book published in Japanese, ``A Japan That Can Say
No,'' stunned Washington when word trickled back of its harsh view
of the United States. But in Japan it has ruffled few feathers
because much of its content ``has been expressed privately by
(Japanese) journalists and businessmen who deal with America,''
Taro Kimura, a former anchorman for Japan Broadcasting Corp.,
commented in a newspaper column.
   One of the book's authors, Shintaro Ishihara, a right-wing
former Cabinet minister, went beyond the usual criticisms of U.S.
corporate shortsightedness and product quality. He wrote that
racial prejudice is at the base of U.S.-Japan frictions. American
whites, realizing their culture is declining, fear losing
leadership to the ``yellow-race Japanese,'' he said.
   But Ishihara's outspokenness still represents an extreme. The
irony of U.S.-Japan frictions is that both sides _ the Japanese in
particular _ seem to try so hard to avoid misunderstanding.
   Many Americans _ even President Bush _ say they welcome Japanese
investment here. And no one denies that many Japanese are still
more mad for the West than mad at it. Japanese companies still pay
out monstrous fees for endorsements by such American celebrities as
Michael Jackson (who are rarely if ever seen in U.S. ads). Most
Japanese cigarettes and many other products bear English names like
Peace and Seven Stars, giving them the kind of cachet that
French-sounding brands once had for Americans earlier in the
century.
   In February, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, in an
apparent reference to recent polls, worried that ``some (Americans)
are expressing the view that the economic threat from Japan is more
serious than the military threat from the Soviet Union.''
   ``The big problem underlying such a fear,'' he said, is ``that
it is impossible to guess where Japan's huge economic power is
headed, and under what philosophy or principles.
   ``What we need is to make further efforts to convey our views
and way of thinking clearly to Americans.''
   Accordingly, kokusaika, or ``internationalization,'' has become
the official rage in Japan. The government, for example, has
proposed tax breaks for companies that increase imports to Japan or
make donations in the United States.
   Most Japanese companies have rooted themselves in America as
successfully as their products _ and more successfully than their
European competitors, according to a survey released last year by
Columbia University's School of Business.
   The study found that, on average, Japanese firms in the United
States have outperformed European competitors in terms of low
absentee rates, low manager turnover and high product quality,
among other criteria.
   In addition, recent polls have found that while mistrust is on
the rise, a majority of Americans still have favorable feelings
toward Japan.
   So, trade frictions aside, what's wrong?
   For one thing, many Japan observers contend that at the level of
top management, at least, ``Americanization'' of Japanese-owned
firms in the United States is just window dressing, a commercial
ploy like the marketing of Christmas in Tokyo department stores,
where few shoppers are Christian.
   While Japan's famed worker-participation techniques, such as
quality circles, may work on the factory floor, American managers
of Japanese subsidiaries are still under the yoke of a ``shadow
system'' of command from Tokyo, some experts say.
   According to the first systematic survey of American managers in
Japanese corporations, released last fall by the University of
Michigan, most are excluded from planning and decision-making
inside the companies and have little access to strategic
information.
   Under the ``two-tiered'' Japanese employment system, Japanese
managers do a three- to five-year rotation abroad. When they return
to Japan, they are typically replaced by another Japanese executive
from overseas rather than the Americans who have worked alongside
them. This has led to resentment among many American managers.
   In addition, the Michigan study found that women and minorities
still suffer widespread discrimination by Japanese companies.
   Minolta's Kusumoto, who has been in the United States more than
20 years and recently published a book on his experiences, ``My
Bridge to America,'' asks that Americans be patient and recognize
that Japan's tightly knit society can unravel itself only so fast.
   ``Many Japanese are hesitant to disclose secrets to Americans,''
he says. ``We came from companies with so-called lifetime
employment. We have complete trust in an employee because we know
he's going to stay. But here many people come and go, and we think
maybe he'll give secrets to a competitor.''
   Kusumoto says that only recently have he and other Japanese
executives felt strongly enough of the loyalty of long-standing
American employees to promote them to top positions.
   ``It's not racial,'' he says. ``It's a matter of trust.''

   Anger over the U.S. trade deficit is fed by a
growing belief in Washington that Japan, once seen as a junior
partner recreated in our image after World War II, has been playing
by its own rules.
   In his much-discussed 1988 book, ``Trading Places,'' Clyde
Prestowitz, ad former Commerce Department trade
negotiator, contends the Japanese have always identified national
security with economic security.
   While America has been preoccupied fighting the Cold War _ to
the  Japan expert anbenefit of allies such as Japan _ Japan has taken our
trusting
free-traders for a ride, Prestowitz says.
   Unlike U.S. policy-makers hostile to direct government support
of business, Japan's powerful bureaucracy has generously subsidized
its key industries in an export-at-all-costs drive for global
supremacy in consumer electronics, automobiles and other important
industries.
   Unlike U.S. policy-makers concerned mostly about keeping
consumer prices low _ and thus markets open _ resource-poor Japan
has subtly but effectively closed many of its markets to foreign
imports. How else but through waves of unanswered exports could the
Japanese pay for their raw materials?
   The familiar pattern, the Prestowitz schooBut Farren concedes that
other countries are looking to Japan's
model.
   ``Japan is running the risk of spreading the contagion of closed
markets to the rest of world,'' he says.

   A recent Census Bureau report showed that the
proportion of blacks living in the South is growing for the first
time in more than a century, reversing a long trend of migration to
the North. Here's the story of one black family that fled
oppressive segregation in Georgia only to return years later to a
friendlier climate.

   It was 1964, the year of ``Freedom
Summer,'' that Jerry Hardee and his wife left Georgia for the
promise of the North.
   It was the year that young blacks and whites from the North
poured into the Southeast with dreams of vanquishing deeply
entrenched segregation.
   Hardee, a teacher in a segregated high school where his students
wore hand-me-down football jerseys from the nearby white school,
had had enough. He and his family headed for Chicago.
   Now Hardee is back, part of a migratory trend that has reversed
the century-long exodus of blacks seeking freedom from segregation
and opportunity in the North.
   ``We talked about it, prayed about it and decided our youngsters
were at the age where they needed to be closer to the areas where
we grew up to get to know their relatives and be around black
people,'' says Hardee, an assistant to the president of Valdosta
State College.
   ``I wanted to be closer to my family,'' adds his wife, Wyonnie.
``I was tired of the hustle and bustle. I just wanted a different
environment, especially for the boys.''
   Both of them took pay cuts to make the move, but they were not
alone in making the decision.
   A Census Bureau report released in January said the share of
blacks living in the South is growing for the first time in more
than a century. The proportion of American blacks living in
Southern states was 55.9 percent as of March 1988, up from 52.2
percent in 1980 and the first increase in at least 100 years.
   Those numbers do not include Hardee's younger son, a New York
financial analyst. And his elder son plans to return to the North,
for him the scene of happier days.
   But the parents are glad to be home.
   ``Many blacks used to be ashamed to be from Southern states,''
Hardee says. ``Now they're proud. There used to be nothing in the
South for a black person except to work and go to church. Blacks
now own businesses, and the South generally is a better place for
black people to live.''
   Hardee grew up in the coastal Georgia city of Brunswick. His
father, C.S. Hardee, was a Baptist minister. His mother, Macedonia,
earned $18 a week as a school cafeteria worker and $2 an evening as
a maid.
   The couple emphasized education, and all of Hardee's seven
brothers and sisters earned at least some college credits.
   Hardee earned a teaching degree at Clark College in Atlanta,
where he met his wife, an Atlanta native.
   When he started teaching math at Center High in Waycross, he
found black students using hand-me-down books and football jerseys
that were no longer needed in the white schools. He earned extra
money as a waiter in a white club and as a laborer in tobacco
warehouses.
   ``It was very disgusting to me to have a college degree and have
to wait on tables to make ends meet,'' he recalls. ``The people I
waited on had far less education, but they treated me like nobody.
In order to get a tip, I had to say, `Yes sir' and `No sir.' I
played the game.''
   His wife earned 50 cents an hour working in a pecan shelling
plant. She said blacks had to stand beside a conveyor belt in a
noisy part of the plant and remove shells, while whites worked as
foremen or operated bagging machines in a room equipped with stools.
   ``There were two of everything,'' Hardee recalls. ``Two public
schools. Two sets of drinking fountains.''
   Blacks had to sit in the balconies of movie theaters, blacks
were not allowed in downtown restaurants, blacks had to sit in the
back of buses and were expected to be off the streets by sundown.
   ``If blacks were traveling you had to carry a box with your
lunch,'' Hardee recalls. ``If you had to go to the bathroom, you
had to stop and use the woods. Most service stations didn't have a
restroom for blacks. They'd have a big sign on the door saying
`Whites Only.'''
   Frustrated with his low teaching salary and lack of opportunity,
Hardee accepted a grant to work on his master's degree at Fisk
University in Nashville, Tenn. He earned his advanced degree in
1963 and accepted a teaching job at a predominantly white school in
the Chicago suburb of Maywood.
   His new job paid $10,000 a year _ four times his salary in
Georgia. He eventually was promoted to a $26,000-a-year job as the
principal of a mostly white elementary school.
   Mrs. Hardee, meantime, took a job as a telephone operator for
Commonwealth Edison Co., an electric utility. She later became a
customer service representative, a job that increased her earnings
to about $23,000 a year.

   ``We had a nice house with a small mortgage,'' Hardee says. ``A
lot of people couldn't understand why we would give all that up to
move back to the South.''
   But even in the North, racism had continued to haunt them.
Hardee recalls that he was turned down for an apartment in a white
neighborhood. He says banks and real estate agents discriminated
against blacks by rejecting loan applications and refusing to sell
them homes in certain neighborhoods.
   ``There were incidents in various sections of the North that
were as racist as what had gone on in the South,'' he says. ``There
was always the matter of some unions that were opposed to having
blacks as members.''
   Hardee says he believes desegregation went smoother in the South
than the North. ``You didn't have the violent confrontations in
most areas of the South as you did in the North, even regarding
busing.''
   Hardee decided he should get a doctorate before returning to
Georgia, so he commuted 120 miles twice a week for two years to
earn the degree at Northern Illinois University. The Hardees
arrived back in Georgia in 1976.
   In Georgia, Hardee took a $17,000-a-year job as an administrator
and math teacher at Fort Valley State College, a historically black
school near Macon. His wife became a secretary at the college.
   The couple's two teen-age sons, Gerald and Sidney, had attended
a mostly white Lutheran school in Illinois, but at Fort Valley
enrolled in Peach County High School, which will end a tradition of
holding separate black and white proms this year.
   Gerald Hardee, now 29, says he plans to move back to Illinois
when he earns a degree at Valdosta State College. An avid wrestler,
he had to give up the sport because his new school didn't have a
wrestling program.
   Going to school in Georgia, he says, ``was a lot different.
People made fun of the way we talked. I think I became quieter down
here. Up there I was a star in football, wrestling, and had more
friends.''
   Sidney Hardee, 24, who found that ``some of those suburbs of
Chicago are more racist than the South,'' graduated from Yale in
1988 and works as a financial analyst for Solomon Brothers Inc. in
New York.
   Their father transferred to Valdosta State in 1984 as an
associate professor. The next year he was appointed assistant to
the president, responsible for affirmative action programs and for
helping black students succeed at a predominantly white college.
   ``By the time I got back, most schools were desegregated, the
Civil Rights Act had been passed ... I think whites had made up
their minds that they had to include blacks in the economic growth
that was taking place in the South,'' Hardee says. ``The whole
attitude, especially around the larger cities in the South, had
changed dramatically in the treatment of blacks, in terms of jobs,
living conditions and in terms of services in the black community.''
   Hardee's wife, concerned that too many black students are
ill-prepared for college, earned a degree in Fort Valley and began
teaching in 1986 at the Lomax-Pinevale Elementary School, a mostly
black school in a poor section of Valdosta. She stays late to work
with students and often drives them home.
   Her dedication has not been overlooked. She was selected
Valdosta's teacher of the year for 1989-90.
   ``When I left Georgia, I didn't have any white friends. It was
strictly segregated,'' Mrs. Hardee recalls. ``When I came back, we
lived in a black community in Fort Valley, but here in Valdosta you
live where your money will take you. I have black and white
friends.''
   Hardee also is active in civic affairs. He covers a 41-county
area making speeches on behalf of the college and teaches Sunday
School classes occasionally at Bethel CME Church.
   The Hardees live in a brick ranch-style home surrounded by
pines, palms and a eucalyptus tree in a white middle-class
neighborhood. Their carpeted living room has a piano, a fireplace
and a cabinet full of photo albums. Many of the pictures, some
faded and out of focus, were taken during sightseeing trips to the
Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls and other attractions with their sons.
   ``I couldn't have written a better script for my life,'' Hardee
says. ``Although in the North I was financially all right, there
were other areas that were missing and there were things money
can't buy.
   ``People were closer in the South. You passed people in the
street _ white or black _ and they would speak. Those were the kind
of things I could feel good about coming back to.''

   Thanks to nearly a century of government
protection, there are now more than 14 million birds of 18 species
living in the Hawaiian and Pacific Islands national wildlife
refuges. One of the most spectacular of these refuges is on the
lava cliff's of Hawaii's Kauai Island, where a visitor may spot a
``gooney bird'' or a humpback whale, a red-footed booby or a monk
seal among the varied species of wildlife.

<DATELINE>KILAUEA POINT, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranger Dan Moriarty's day was off
to a typical start. There was an injured albatross in his bathtub
and a dead sea turtle at his front door, both probably the victims
of roving wild dogs or cats.
   Moriarty is manager of the Kilauea Point National Wildlife
Refuge in the northernmost inhabited part of the Hawaiian Islands,
a 45-minute flight from Honolulu.
   Crowning the crest of Kauai Island's sheer lava cliffs, the
refuge is dominated by a now-dark lighthouse listed on the National
Register of Historic Places.
   With its dramatic coastline, pounding surf, jagged precipices
and jade-green rain forests, the refuge once attracted few visitors
because it was so hard to reach. Now nearly 300,000 tourists a year
come to visit.
   They can train their binoculars on thousands of birds, including
four endangered species and a few elusive aviators nicknamed
``gooney birds,'' albatrosses that mysteriously have been coming
all the way from Midway Island to nest since 1976.
   If the ocean is not too rough, the visitors may also catch
glimpses of Pacific green turtles, humpback whales that swim from
Alaska to bear their young just offshore, endangered Hawaiian monk
seals and spinner dolphins frolicking in the turquoise waves.
   Moriarty also presides over two other nearby refuges, neither of
them open to the public. Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge,
established in 1972, set aside 917 acres of the Hanalei Valley
where farmers with federal permits grow the native vegetable taro
for commercial sale. Hanalei taro is now served in some of Kauai's
best restaurants.
   The smaller 240-acre Huleia preserve offers unique river-bottom
habitat for endangered water birds.
   With only two full-time employees, four part-time workers and a
growing corps of volunteers, Moriarty must stretch his $400,000
annual budget to groom, protect and enhance the three sanctuaries.
   ``This is a very busy refuge. We're running all the time, but
it's such a beautiful place it stimulates you to try and do the
right thing,'' says Moriarty, 49, who joined the Fish and Wildlife
Service in 1976. In 1989 his efforts were recognized by the
National Audubon Society with its annual Conservation Award.
   Thanks to nearly a century of protection, there are now more
than 14 million birds of 18 species living in the Hawaiian and
Pacific Islands national wildlife refuges.
   Moriarty believes many birds stayed at Kilauea because the
lighthouse keepers protected them and their habitat. Since 1913,
when the lighthouse was built, dogs and cats have been banned from
the area.
   ``There are 50 generations of feral cats out there just ready to
destroy the only sea bird colony left in the state,'' Moriarty
says. ``Rats are also a very big problem here. The rats got into
the sugar cane and ate it, and over the years they threw cats out
into the cane to control the rats and mice. One of our biggest jobs
is to make sure the fences surrounding this whole place are not
breached or broken.''
   The grounded albatross in Moriarty's bathtub was probably
attacked by a dog or cat that had managed to sneak beyond the wire
barrier. Because seabirds have no natural predators on the outer
islands, they have no fear of other creatures or man, and are
easily killed.

   As for the sea turtle, which had been decapitated, Moriarity
speculated it, too, fell victim to an alien predator.
   ``In the past 10 years all our populations are up, because of
the fencing, but it's a never-ending battle,'' he says.
   Before Capt. James Cook discovered the islands in 1778, Hawaiian
natives also probably ate the birds. Dogs, cats and mongooses
imported to kill rats also decimated the flocks. Nearly every
threatened bird population except the one at Kilauea withdrew to
the central Pacific.
   Today there are five wetland refuges on the main Hawaiian
Islands and six remote island sanctuaries that stretch all the way
to French Frigate Shoals and Howland Island, a mere dot in the
ocean 1,700 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   Kilauea's original 31 acres were transferred from the Coast
Guard to the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1976 when the old
lighthouse was deactivated. For 63 years it had served as the main
Hawaiian landfall light for ships passing from the Orient to the
West Coast.
   The refuge's acreage multipled in 1988 when a land developer
donated 101 acres and sold an additional 38 for $1.6 million. The
addition extended the refuge 1{ miles east along the coast to
include the magnificent Crater Hill, home of a major red-footed
booby rookery, and Mokolea Point. It also encompasses the remains
of Kauai, a volcano that has been dormant for more than a million
years.
   Last year a new $1 million environmental education center opened
just a few hundred feet from the old lighthouse. It offers a
180-degree view of Crater Hill and the nearby meadow where the
Laysan albatrosses canter and tumble downhill until they gather
speed for a graceful launch into flight above the roaring ocean.
   The huge birds, which have a mature wingspan of 7 feet, are
native to the northwestern Hawaiian archipelago but were rarely
seen until they showed up near Kilauea in 1976.
   Since then, very few chicks have survived because of predators
or immature mating. Last year on the refuge grounds there were 18
albatross nests, but only nine chicks hatched and all of them were
killed by wild cats.
   ``This year, we had 46 eggs, but only 16 hatched,'' Moriarty
said in late February. ``So far, cats have killed half of those
chicks, but we have trapped 21 cats including a very big tomcat we
just caught, which we think was doing most of the damage, so
hopefully we're gaining on it and some of this year's chicks will
survive.''
   Moriarty, who earns about $31,000 a year, now lives alone in the
small stone house alloted to the chief ranger. His wife and three
children have moved to an apartment in Honolulu until the children
graduate from high school. The oldest is a freshman, the youngest
is in third grade. Sometimes they come home on weekends, or he
flies over to Oahu to see them when he can get a weekend off.
   To chase away the silence, Moriarty recently bought his first
television set.
   ``But the stuff is awful,'' he says, ``so most of the time I
turn it off and just come back to the office to work.
   ``I'd rather be with the birds any day than listen to most of
that TV stuff.''

   Remembrances of the Holocaust still shape
Israeli attitudes, but with the emergence of a new generation there
is less sensitivity about old taboos. Thus German composers and
thinkers once considered anathemas are beginning to find audiences
in the Jewish state.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slowly, one step at a time, Israelis appear to
be changing their feelings toward German artists and intellectuals
tainted by Nazism and are beginning to accept them into the
nation's cultural mainstream.
   Such as composer Richard Wagner, philosopher Martin Heidegger
and conductor Herbert von Karajan.
   But their names and their works still arouse strong emotions in
this Jewish state, which served as a refuge for hundreds of
thousands of survivors of the Nazi Holocaust.
   The changing attitudes were recently reflected in the visit to
Israel of Wagner's great-grandson, Gottfried, 42, who came here in
an effort to erase, or at least change, the image of the composer
as a symbol of the Nazi regime.
   He said he found wide support for lifting the Jewish state's ban
on Wagner's music.
   ``It was more than I had hoped for. Again and again people told
me, `Come back, you are on the right way, we are on your side',''
Wagner said.
   Anti-Wagner feelings still abound, however.
   Holocaust survivor Ben Zion Leitner said hearing Wagner was like
being back in the Nazi labor camp where he was held as a teen-ager
and where a sadistic commandant played Wagner's operas when guards
whipped inmates.
   Nine years ago, Leitner stopped an attempt by the Israel
Philharmonic Orchestra to break the Wagner ban and play the
overture to ``Tristan and Isolde.'' Leitner, an usher at Tel Aviv's
Mann Auditorium, rushed to the stage, pulled up his shirt to show
Nazi-inflicted scars and shouted, ``Play Wagner over my body.''
   ``As long as survivors are still alive, we must not play Wagner
in public,'' Leitner, 65, said in a recent interview.
   But Gottfried Wagner said he did not encounter protests aimed at
him or his ancestor during his 12-day visit, which included four
university lectures, talks with Israeli music lovers and
intellectuals, media interviews and an appearance on state
television.
   He told Israelis that the 19th century composer did not deserve
to be shunned, arguing Wagner was exploited by the Nazis and
members of the Wagner clan close to Hitler.
   The younger Wagner said his great-grandfather had an ambiguous
attitude toward Jews.
   On the one hand the composer expressed anti-Semitic views
sparked by jealousy of successful Jewish composers, but on the
other hand several of his close collaborators were Jews. In his
stagework, the composer did not express anti-Semitism, Gottfried
Wagner argued.
   However, he said it was up to the Israelis to decide whether to
end the ban.
   ``Israelis of all generations have the right to be skeptical
toward Wagner,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Cerro Maggiore, Italy. ``But a serious debate about Wagner should
finally make it possible to rediscover his international importance
as an avant garde music drama man, and prevent future political
abuse of his work.''
   Much of Israel's music establishment, including most musicians
of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, favors an end to the Wagner
ban.
   ``You have to distinguish between the composing genius and the
somewhat tainted human being,'' said Alfred Frankenstein, 84, a Tel
Aviv music critic who fled Berlin in 1935. ``We are the ones who
are losing by not playing Wagner.''
   The Wagner case indicates that while the Holocaust still shapes
Israeli attitudes, there is less sensitivity about old taboos
because of the passage of time and the emergence of a new
generation that has no direct experience of Nazi rule.
   ``Many people belonging to the generation concerned have died
out. There is still high awareness, but it's maybe less raw, less
emotional than in the 1950s and '60s,'' said Daniel Shek, a
government official in his 30s whose Czech parents survived the
Theresienstadt death camp.

   Greater historical and emotional distance to the Holocaust also
has sparked a re-evaluation of other artists and thinkers
associated with the Nazis.
   One example is German composer and conductor Richard Strauss
(1864-1949), who had been boycotted in Israel because he served as
head of musical affairs under the Nazis in 1933 and 1934.
   Two recent recitals included Strauss lieder and passed without
protest. On March 18, the Symphony Orchestra of Rishon Lezion, a
Tel Aviv suburb, played for the first time a major Strauss work,
the ``Metamorphosen'' for string instruments.
   It was received by the audience with shouts of ``bravo.''
   ``We cannot escape Richard Strauss. It is a must for the Israeli
music lover to hear this work,'' said Noam Sheriff, the orchestra's
musical director.
   Sheriff recently asked his musicians to play Wagner in
rehearsal, arguing that they would not become polished musicians
without mastering Wagner. The musicians, most in their 20s and 30s,
practiced ``Die Meistersinger'' without protest, he said.
   Another example is German philospher Martin Heidegger, a fervent
Hitler follower who denounced colleagues at Freiburg University to
the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police.
   The works of Heidegger, whose ideas influenced existentialists
such as Jean Paul Sartre, have been taught at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem since 1982.
   Lecturer Gabriel Motzkin said that he included Heidegger in his
course on German philosphers because his work is too important to
ignore, but that he made students aware of Heidegger's political
beliefs.
   The dilemma faced by Israeli music lovers or philosphy students
is not present in the world of publishing.
   ``Totalitarianism by nature does not produce good books that are
worth translating,'' said Beth Elon, editorial director of the
Domino publishing house in Jerusalem.
   She said her company refused to publish a Hebrew version of
Hitler's manifesto, ``Mein Kampf'' (My Struggle), but said the
considerations were purely commercial.
   ``It was a dull, unwieldy book, real heavy going. Even the shock
value wasn't shocking,'' Ms. Elon said.
   These developments suggest that while certain barriers have
fallen, the trauma of the Holocaust remains a central part of
Israeli life.
   The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, for example, never set foot
in Israel because its conductor, Herbert von Karajan, had been a
member of the Nazi Party. Only Karajan's death last year paved the
way for a tour of Israel by the orchestra, scheduled for this month.
   This ambivalence also finds expression in other fields.
   On the one hand, German-made cars and electrical appliances are
proudly displayed as status symbols, and elderly German-born Jews
are no longer reluctant to speak their mother tongue in public.
   On the other hand, Israeli leaders are cautious in approaching
the question of establishing ties with East Germany, which refused
for years to accept any official responsibility for the Holocaust.
   This ambivalence still shows up on the concert stage. In Israel,
playing Wagner is not the same as playing other composers.
   But Gottfried Wagner expressed optimisim. ``The debate sparked
by my visit gives reason to hope that Wagner one day will emerge
from under Hitler's shadow,'' he said.

   Trucks are to Fultonville what baseball is to
Cooperstown, something that keeps the village out of red ink. Folks
here talk about traffic on the New York Thruway like farmers talk
about the weather. But when one truck stop operator hoisted an
18-wheeler atop a 30-foot water tower as a beacon to truckers, some
officials thought he had gone too far.

<DATELINE>FULTONVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trucks don't outnumber people here, but
it's close.
   An average of more than 600 trucks a day rumble off the New York
State Thruway and cruise down Riverside Drive, Fultonville's
mile-long midway of truck stops, hotels and restaurants.
   On any evening, this tiny Mohawk Valley village of 777 people
welcomes the 18-wheelers spilling in to fill up on diesel fuel or
get fine-tuned as their drivers shower, chow down or bunk for the
night.
   ``After three o'clock the trucks just can't find a place to
park,'' says Wayne Hazzard, the village's fire chief.
   Trucks are everywhere. There's even one in the sky. That rig _
an 18-wheeler painted red, white and blue _ sits atop a 30-foot
water tower advertising the town's claim to fame:
   ``Welcome to Fultonville _ 3 Truck Stops, 4 Motels, 7
Restaurants.''
   Trucks are to Fultonville what baseball is to Cooperstown,
something that keeps the village from both rural anonymity and red
ink.
   The average truck can hold 300 gallons of diesel fuel and the
average trucker can hold a bit more than a sandwich and coffee
after eight hours on the road. With more than 13 million commercial
vehicles _ including commercially registered vans and pickups _
riding the Thruway yearly, those figures mean dollar signs to
Fultonville.
   ``The biggest thing to me is the sales tax money,'' says Mayor
George Wadsworth, who estimates business generated from passing
truckers enriches the village's tax coffers by about $50,000 a year.
   ``And it keeps going up and up.''
   The New York State Thruway Authority counted 244,457 commercial
vehicles using Exit 28 at Fultonville last year, up from 235,237 in
1988.
   That's heavy traffic for a town so small it doesn't even have
its own doctor.
   Beyond Riverside Drive, Fultonville reveals itself to be not all
that much: a general store, post office, a few other businesses and
a couple of blocks of aging houses.
   But Fultonville has shrewdly taken advantage of its location and
small size to attract trucks navigating the trade route between New
England and the upper Midwest.
   ``I kind of like it here,'' says Bob Thompson, a trucker passing
through from New Haven, Mich. ``It's a friendly little place and
it's halfway to anywhere you want to go.''
   Fultonville has capitalized on through-traffic before. The town
once sustained itself on the comings and goings of mule-drawn ships
along the Erie Canal, which cut through the town in the 19th
century.
   That section of the Erie Canal was filled in by the beginning of
this century, but, ironically enough, it was the long-gone canal
that gave impetus to Fultonville's current heyday.
   In the early 1950s, state planners drew the route for the
proposed New York State Thruway right over the old path of the Erie
Canal _ and right through the heart of Fultonville.
   Many here thought it would be the town's death knell.
   ``Everyone was skeptical,'' former mayor George Snyder recalls.
``But I knew there was nothing we could do to stop them ... We
decided to make the best of it.''
   Guessing the superhighway's economic potential, Snyder wheedled
and cajoled politicians in Albany _ including Gov. Thomas E. Dewey
himself _ until Fultonville got its own Thruway exit.
   Under Snyder, the town also became one of the few in upstate New
York to allow tandem trailers, ``double barrels'' as truckers call
them, to exit to their roads.
   Snyder started Fultonville Truck Center in 1954 with four diesel
pumps and 12 rooms with a little diner downstairs. When he sold the
business in 1973, it had 37 pumps.
   That same stop today is the Roadway Motor Plaza, the largest of
the town's three stops, offering 14 motel rooms and dispensing an
average of 5 million gallons of gasoline a year. Next biggest is
Glen Travel Plaza, followed by Countryside Fuel Stop.
   Having multiple truck stops in small towns is not unusual, says
Don Lofstrom, a vice president of the Rochester, N.Y.-based Roadway
Motor Plaza Co., which owns the largest stop.
   ``It's not uncommon for truck stops to be placed in the middle
of no place on interstates,'' Lofstrom says. It can be more
convenient for trucks to stop in small towns like Fultonville or
Buda, Texas, than big cities like Chicago or Houston, he says.
   ``If it's not unusual, then it's certainly laudable,'' says
Roger King, a spokesman for the National Association of Truck Stop
Operators, a Virginia-based trade group. ``It's an example of what
truck stops can be to a community.''
   People here talk about the Thruway like farmers talk about the
weather.
   ``There's enough for all of us as long as we can get them off
the Thruway,'' says Vincent Gramuglia, Countryside's owner.
   Gramuglia is the man who parked a retired semi 45 feet above the
Thruway's roadside flora as a way of attracting business.
   ``Like a lighthouse is to boats, this is to trucks,'' Gramuglia
says.
   The Thruway Authority thinks differently.
   ``The authority considers the device to be ... the most
hazardous, gaudiest, most novel and most distracting advertising
device on the Thruway system and a flagrant violation of its
regulations,'' says a complaint issued by the agency.
   The authority says the truck must go because it does not honor a
660-foot right of way for advertising next to the road.
   While the issue wends its way through state court, the cause of
``The Truck'' has spread beyond the confines of Fultonville.
   Gramuglia has started peddling the ``Save the Truck'' T-shirts
to spread word of his troubles. He's also generated a lot of
support.
   Both Fultonville and the Montgomery County officials have come
out with resolutions supporting Gramuglia. A bill has just been
introduced before the state Assembly.
   ``They're overreacting,'' says state Sen. Hugh Farley, a
supporter of Gramuglia. ``I think they need a sense of humor about
this.''

   Movie director David Lynch, known for his
dark and surreal portraits of contemporary America, is making his
first venture into television with ``Twin Peaks,'' a new wave
Gothic soap opera.
   The two-hour pilot for ``Twin Peaks'' will be televised by ABC
on Sunday and the one-hour drama series begins its regular run on
Thursday.
   Lynch, who has his own little shop of horrors with such films as
``Eraserhead,'' ``Blue Velvet'' and the upcoming ``Wild at Heart,''
says, ``My partner, Mark Frost, and I were fishing for ideas for
television and we hit on making it a soap opera with a murder
mystery.
   ``When we talked about television the main pull for me was being
able to do a continuing story. One where you can really get to know
the people.''
   The two main characters are the murder investigators, FBI Agent
Dale Cooper, played by Kyle MacLachlan of Lynch's ``Blue Velvet''
and ``Dune,'' and Sheriff Harry S. Truman, played by Michael
Ontkean. Laura Palmer is the murder victim.
   ``It opens with the murder. Laura Palmer is like the center of a
little universe of people. What was she up to when she was
murdered? Her death is a great way to get into the lives of the
other characters. It'll take quite a while to resolve.''
   The series has a large ensemble cast, including Joan Chen, Piper
Laurie, Madchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Richard Beymer, Lara Flynn
Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Warren Frost, James Marshall, Everett McGill,
Jack Nance, Ray Wise, Russ Tamblyn and Peggy Lipton _ who is in her
first series since ``The Mod Squad.''
   Set in a Pacific Northwest lumber mill town, ``Twin Peaks'' is
ripping good fun.
   FBI Agent Cooper, who's fascinated by the tall trees, dictates
his every thought into a small tape recorder. Joan Chen, as the
mill owner, is an exotic but determined Dragon Lady. Everybody in
town has a nasty little secret, and the lid keeps popping off at
inappropriate times. It's all done with a straight face, but the
impression is that Lynch is laughing up his sleeve.
   Lynch says he often puts comedy into his work, and in the future
he hopes to do a comedy called ``One Saliva Bubble.'' Frost is a
former writer for ``Hill Street Blues,'' which mixed black comedy
with gritty drama.
   ``I like light and dark,'' Lynch says. ``I like a film that has
contrast so you can feel both sides. I believe people tend to
remember my films as darker than they really are. I think people
identify with a struggle. We like the idea of overcoming obstacles
in our path. I'm kind of interested in that.
   ``I believe in a strong story and one that is easily followed.
Once the audience is pulled in by the story, you can throw in a few
curves. As long as you don't throw them off the track. I like curve
balls.''
   Despite his fascination with such stories, Lynch looks
relentlessly ordinary. His dark brown hair is combed straight back
and he wears a black coat over a white shirt that is buttoned to
the top. He has a slight facial resemblance to John Larroquette of
``Night Court.''
   ``Twin Peaks'' reflects his small town upbringing. He was born
in Montana and grew up in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia. His
father moved often as a research scientist for the Department of
Agriculture.
   Lynch is a man of strong habits. He frequents the same places
and orders the same food day after day, with a preference for junk
food. He also tends to use the same actors in his films.
   MacLachlan starred in ``Dune'' and ``Blue Velvet.'' Jack Nance,
the man who finds Laura Palmer's body in ``Twin Peaks,'' has been
in every Lynch film except ``The Elephant Man.'' Laura Dern and
Isabella Rossellini, Lynch's current romantic interest, were in
``Blue Velvet'' and the new ``Wild at Heart.''
   Lynch says he got into television at the urging of his agent,
Tony Krantz. ``We kept telling him to go away, but one day we
started getting some ideas,'' he says. ``The ideas were perfect for
television.
   ``I really liked working on television. It's very fast. The cast
and the crew and everyone helped make it a great experience. I
learned a lot about working fast. I like the momentum and the
feeling of having to go more quickly. As long as you don't go so
fast you hurt the picture.''
   Lynch acknowledges that film critics have analyzed his work, but
says he operates by a simple credo.
   ``Be true to the story and the ideas in translating them to the
screen,'' he says. ``If you're true to that you will have an honest
picture. The rest is up to the audience. They have the final say.''

<TEXT>
   From ``Cats'' to ``Nicholas Nickleby'' to
``Aspects of Love,'' Trevor Nunn is among the world's most
successful and sought-after directors of both plays and musicals.
   But blockbuster shows constitute only one aspect of his eclectic
career. Shakespeare's plays, T.S. Eliot's verse, a musical about
chess, an obscure English novel _ everything is fodder for Nunn's
vision of the stage as ``a great populist meeting place.''
   ``I'm interested in theater in all its forms, and theater
audiences in all their forms,'' the bearded 50-year-old director
said one evening after work at his office in London's theater
district, where he has four musicals running at the same time.
   ``Cats,'' based on the T.S. Eliot poems, has been running since
1981; ``Starlight Express,'' a show that casts actors as trains,
opened in 1984; ``Les Miserables,'' the Victor Hugo
novel-turned-musical, co-directed by John Caird, followed in 1985;
and last year came ``Aspects of Love,'' based on a little-known
1950s English novel about the complex entanglements of five lovers.
   But for 18 years he also headed or co-headed the Royal
Shakespeare Company, one of Britain's two major state-subsidized
theaters. He left it in 1986, but retains the title ``director
emeritus.''
   Accordingly, his credits present an intriguing mix of ``Romeo
and Juliet'' and roller-skating trains; ``Hedda Gabler'' and
anthropomorphized cats; ``Aspects'' and ``All's Well That Ends
Well''; ``Les Miserables'' and ``Macbeth.''
   ``I don't like categories; I don't like signatures,'' says Nunn,
defining a career that began at Cambridge University where he
directed the Footlights' Revue.
   ``I don't see any disparity between different types of work. To
have eclecticism only requires a theater community with sufficient
variety and sufficient promotion of that variety.''
   Whether directing the Bard in Stratford-upon-Avon or a mammoth
musical on Broadway, Nunn feels, ``There's no point in doing it for
the critics or the already converted.''
   But it's musicals that have given Nunn fame and wealth, most
often in conjunction with composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.
   In 1981, they paired up on a song cycle of Eliot's ``Old
Possum's Poems for Practical Cats,'' which Lloyd Webber thought
might make a charming children's entertainment.
   Theater insiders were disdainful, but the result was ``Cats,''
currently purring its way toward a gross of over $460 million in
the United States alone.
   Nunn says the show married a love of language to his
long-standing interest in musicals. Indeed, he had turned down
several previous offers that didn't seem right, including ``42nd
Street'' on Broadway, which he felt an American should do.
   During ``Cats'' rehearsals, Lloyd Webber gave Nunn a copy of the
1955 novel ``Aspects of Love,'' by David Garnett. Nine years later,
their musical version, still running in London, is now playing at
the Broadhurst Theater in New York.
   The show concerns a lovestruck quintet pursuing their
emotionally dangerous liaisons in the south of France. Four of its
stars originated their parts on the West End.
   Michael Ball, a Briton making his Broadway debut, plays Alex, an
English army recruit whose love for a French actress (Ann Crumb)
shapes his entire life. Kevin Colson is Alex's dilettantish uncle,
George. Kathleen Rowe McAllen plays George's Italian mistress
Giulietta.
   ``It's a piece of work interested in character, and the
character is artfully and cleverly and touchingly presented,'' Nunn
says.
   As production costs rise on Broadway and critical pressures
mount, Lloyd Webber is one of the few theater artists whose
box-office clout makes him impervious to the reviews, which can be
harsh.
   Nunn's career has ridden its own critical roller coaster. In
London, plaudits have been tempered with accusations that he has
sold out to the commercial theater, sacrificing first-rate work in
the classics for the ready money of the major musical. On Broadway,
both ``Starlight Express'' and ``Chess'' were poorly received.
   ``Many of the things I've done have run long periods of time no
thanks to critical reactions, which were frequently very hostile,''
he says. ``Therefore I have every reason to trust the general
public.''
   By and large, that public has confirmed his trust. ``Nicholas
Nickleby,'' an adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel, opened to
lukewarm reviews in London in 1980, then became a popular favorite
on both sides of the Atlantic, despite a Broadway top ticket of
$100.
   ``Les Miserables,'' adapted from Victor Hugo's epic novel, got
mixed reviews at its 1985 London bow, but swept the 1987 Tony
Awards on Broadway and won international acclaim.
   Occasionally, Nunn misjudges. His staging of ``Chess,'' the Tim
Rice-ABBA musical, ran more than three years on the West End but a
scant 10 weeks on Broadway in 1988. A Broadway revival of
``Nicholas Nickleby'' also flopped.
   In January, Nunn's London production of the American musical
``The Baker's Wife'' closed after 56 performances at a loss of
almost $1.7 million.
   Its flop was ``very disappointing _ denting as well as
daunting,'' he says.
   The musical starred his second wife, Australian performer Sharon
Lee Hill, in the lead role. The couple, who met when she appeared
in ``Cats,'' have two daughters. He has a son by his previous wife,
actress Janet Suzman.
   Away from the high-stakes world of musicals, Nunn continues to
mount landmark productions of the classics. Last fall, he returned
to the Royal Shakespeare Company to stage ``Othello,'' with opera
singer Willard White as the jealous Moor and Ian McKellen as his
nemesis, Iago.
   Nunn has also triumphed with more obscure Shakespeare works. His
1982 ``All's Well That Ends Well,'' seen in London and New York,
made one of the Bard's so-called ``problem plays'' hauntingly clear
and poignant.
   Plans for the future include another collaboration with David
Edgar, who adapted ``Nicholas Nickleby,'' and a staging of
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' which Nunn calls ``one of the
unassailable masterpieces of the Western world.''

   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said it will let
former suitor Marvin Davis again buy company stock, raising the
possibility of a rival buyout offer to the $3.8 billion bid by
UAL's unions and a major shareholder.
   Davis sparked a bidding war for UAL last August but later
withdrew his buyout proposals after the company, the parent of
United Airlines, accepted a higher offer from a group led by senior
management and its pilots union. That plan later collapsed.
   UAL stock finished up $5.12{ at $157.87{ Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, although Coniston Partners, UAL's biggest
shareholder and the backer of the union buyout, expressed
skepticism that Davis would make an offer.

<HEAD>Producers Expect Weaker Prices in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto one word is cq throughout</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of crude oil should fall in the
April-June quarter before rising in the last half of the year, the
world's leading oil producers believe.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said Sunday the 13 Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and more than a dozen independent
oil producers differed on how steep the price fall would be but
agreed it would not be sharp.
   ``In the short term we foresee some weakness in the second
quarter. But in the third and fourth quarter the market will
strengthen,'' Subroto said. ``Everybody seems to agree there will
not be a dramatic change in price.''
   Subroto made the comments to reporters during a conference of
experts from OPEC and independent producers including the Soviet
Union and Norway, the U.S. oil-producing states of Alaska and
Texas, and the Canadian province of Alberta.
   Over the longer term, Subroto said delegates expected world
crude oil demand to grow about 3.2 percent to 3.3 percent per year.
But he said there also were differences of opinion on that subject.
   The experts met over the weekend following an OPEC ministerial
meeting in Vienna last week. The cartel voted to maintain a
production ceiling of 22 million barrels per day for the April-June
quarter.
   Oil prices have fallen since the OPEC meeting because of lack of
firm guarantees by member states not to overshoot individual
production quotas and because of the end of high winter demand.
   OPEC is believed to be producing about 1 million barrels a day
more of crude oil than the market can absorb. OPEC ministers are to
meet meet May 25 to consider production and pricing policy for the
cartel for the second half of 1990.
   Delegates to the Muscat conference said no decisions were made
on production or pricing policies.
   Oman, which is not an OPEC member, has played a major role in
generating support of other independents to restrict oil output and
help OPEC's targeted prices.
   Omani Minister of Petroleum and Minerals Saeed Ahmed Shanfari
said ``common understanding'' was still needed between the two
blocs on short-, medium- and long-term policies even though world
oil demand was rising.
   ``We've proved that the independent oil producers and exporters
are serious in their efforts and are ready to shoulder part of the
responsibility with OPEC to achieve stability of the market and its
prices,'' he said Saturday.
   OPEC, faced with a collapsing oil market in 1986, pressed for
the support of major producers outside the cartel to coordinate
output to stabilize prices around $18 a barrel. But rising world
demand helped strengthen prices beyond $18.
   A 1988 conference similar to the one in Muscat produced an
agreement for a self-imposed 5 percent production cutback to
bolster OPEC efforts.
   The market has steadily improved with an unexpected rise in
demand induced by dwindling production levels in the United States
and the Soviet Union, as well as other majors. Tapping into
possible high demand from Eastern Europe also is being considered.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies except the British pound in early European trading
today. Gold prices fell sharply.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading was a little nervous
because of continued yen weakness and market fears about tensions
in the independence-minded Baltic republics of the Soviet Union.
   ``The Lithuania situation is keeping everybody on the edge,''
said one trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt, West Germany. ``As
long as there is the threat of military conflict, the dollar will
remain firm.''
   Traders said the dollar was also benefiting from the weakness of
the yen following a largely uneventful meeting Friday between U.S.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto of Japan.
   ``Brady made it clear he doesn't want to go to extraordinary
lengths for the yen,'' said a trader in Milan, Italy. ``The view is
that the yen's weakness is tied to uncertainties about the stock
market and fiscal year-end considerations.''
   The dollar's scope for upward movement is limited by fear of
central bank intervention, traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.33 yen to 156.40 yen, its highest close since
Jan. 13, 1987. Later, in London, it was quoted at 155.98 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7165 West German marks, up from 1.7100; 1.5195
Swiss francs, up from 1.5179; 5.7725 French francs, up from 5.7645;
1.9230 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9249; 1,261.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,258.50; and 1.1765 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1751.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6127, compared with $1.6040 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $388.50 a troy ounce, up
from $386.95 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $379.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $378.00, down $15.05 from late
Friday's $393.05.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.49 to close at a bid $384.94.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.03 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $5.04.

<HEAD>Tokyo Index Up 5 Percent; Dollar Gains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index soared by
nearly 5 percent today in its second-biggest single-day rise ever,
while the dollar gained more against the Japanese yen despite
central bank intervention.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
528.82 points last Friday, surged 1,468.33 points, or 4.83 percent,
today closing at 31,840.49.
   The gain was second only to the 2,037.32-point rise on Oct. 21,
1987, when shares prices rebounded from the worldwide ``Black
Monday'' crash.
   Last Monday, the index dived 1,353.20 points at the start of a
three-day plunge that took the index below 30,000 before it began
rebounding Friday.
   Many investors believed the index had bottomed out last week,
when it fell a total of 2,773.1 points in three days, securities
dealers said.
   ``Shares were broadly bought in anticipation of the actual start
of the new fiscal year,'' a dealer with Nomura Securities said on
condition of anonymity. Japan's fiscal year formally begins on
April 1, but after today, new contracts are counted under the new
fiscal year.
   While share prices rose almost across the board, construction
and electric power issues led the gains.
   Blue-chip electrical shares, such as Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony,
were also big gainers.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated
at 700 million shares, compared with last Friday's 668.98 million
shares.
   On the currency market, the dollar closed at 156.40 yen, up 1.33
yen from last Friday's close of 155.07 yen. After opening at 155.65
yen, it ranged between 155.50 yen and 156.40 yen.
   The dollar's close was its highest since 156.00 on Jan. 13,
1987. It now has gained 4.20 yen in the last seven trading days.
   Previously, the weak yen has been cited as one factor behind
declining stock prices. The sagging bond market was another.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds, due
June 1999, finished today at 86.82 yen, up 0.22 yen from Friday's
close of 86.60 points, with the yield dropping 0.045 percentage
points to 7.170 percent.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's strength today to the
market's disappointment over Friday's talks between Japanese
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicolas Brady in Los Angeles.
   ``Nothing came out of the the talks'' that would help stabilize
exchange rates, said Naoto Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank
of Tokyo.
   Hashimoto and Brady said in a statement that they discussed a
range of issues and remained committed to ``cooperation in the
exchange markets,'' a reference to efforts to stop the yen's slide
against the dollar.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, sold up to $1
billion in efforts to support the yen, traders estimated. The bank
does not comment on its market intervention activities.
   ``Due to the relatively weak position on market intervention by
the monetary authorities, the bullish sentiment toward the dollar
remains strong,'' said Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitui Bank.
Yoshida said speculators accounted for most of today's early
dollar-buying.

<TEXT>
   Former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood has left town and the voices of protest that marked the
first anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill have quieted.
Now, the legal cleanup begins.
   With more than 150 lawsuits on file against Exxon Corp.,
Hazelwood and others, Alaska's court calendars will be clogged for
years to come.
   Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Co., the oil company consortium that
operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and Valdez terminal, also
have been indicted by a federal grand jury on five criminal counts
stemming from the grounding of the Exxon Valdez.
   The tanker hemorrhaged nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude
oil into Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, killing countless
birds, fish and other wildlife and fouling the rocky shore for
hundreds of miles.
   As many as 75 people marked the anniversary Saturday with a
protest outside Alyeska headquarters in Anchorage. Someone
splattered the building with a plastic bag filled with chocolate
syrup _ intended to symbolize spilled crude.
   Environmental groups held low-key events to raise money for
spill-prevention efforts and to pursue Valdez-related lawsuits.
   Gov. Steve Cowper called n Exxon to settle quickly the flood of
lawsuits filed by environmental groups, fishermen, native Alaskans
and the state.
   The lawsuits are not scheduled for trial until 1992. If Exxon
does not settle all valid spill-related lawsuits, litigation could
drag on into the next century, Cowper said.
   A lawyer coordinating the lawsuits said he wants to set a
precedent.
   ``We have to make it unprofitable to pollute,'' said attorney
Macon Cowles of Boulder, Colo.
   The National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Fund
and other plaintiffs want Exxon to set up a fund to pay for
environmental damage assessment, restoration and the purchase of
wildlife preserves.
   Cowles said he might even try to collect damages on behalf of
plants and animals.
   ``We're trying to come up with a way to put a value on the
devastation to life,'' he said. Cowles said it might take 10 years
to assess that damage.
   Hazelwood, the only individual charged criminally in the spill,
was convicted last Thursday of a state misdemeanor charge of
neglegent discharge of oil, but was acquitted of second-degree
criminal mischief, a felony, and misdemeanor charges of reckless
endangerment and operating ship under the influence of alcohol.
   In an emotional hearing on Friday, Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone sentenced the skipper to spend 1,000 hours helping to
clean up oiled beaches. He also ordered Hazelwood to pay $50,000 in
restitution.
   Hazelwood's lawyers said they would appeal the conviction and
the highly unusual sentence, which they asserted was harsher than
the law allows.
   The judge said he will stay Hazelwood's sentence once the appeal
is filed.
   In an interview before he left Alaska, Hazelwood said he was
troubled by the enormous environmental devastation in Prince
William Sound.
   ``It was terrible,'' he said. ``It's like any devastation. It's
like Chernobyl or medical waste washing up on my back yard in Long
Island (N.Y.). ... It was a terrible tragedy. There's no getting
around it.''
   But Hazelwood, 43, was prevented from giving his own view of
what caused the Exxon Valdez to run aground on Bligh Reef. His
lawyers feared his comments might affect the outcome of the
lawsuits against him.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard plans to hold hearings on whether
Hazelwood's maritime master's license should be suspended, renewed
or revoked, Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost said.
   But Yost appeared to partially absolve Hazelwood of
responsibility, saying, ``A fully qualified third mate ran the
vessel aground.''
   Hazelwood was below deck when the accident occurred. Third mate
Gregory Cousins was on the bridge, directing a helmsman at the
wheel. Jurors in Hazelwood's trial rejected the claim that the
skipper was reckless to leave the bridge in Cousins' control.
   In the federal indictments, Exxon is charged with staffing the
tanker with people who were physically or mentally incapable of
performing their duties. Hazelwood's acquittal could weigh in the
company's favor on that charge.

<HEAD>Petition Filed to Decertify Union Local at Nordstrom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A petition has been filed to decertify the union
representing employees at Nordstrom Inc.'s Tacoma store, the
retailer said.
   Nordstrom said Sunday that it was notified of the filing by the
National Labor Relations Board.
   The store has 310 employees represented by Local 367 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union. To hold a decertification
election, at least 30 percent of the employees in a bargaining unit
must sign the petition.
   A union leader said Sunday that the petition was expected and
was an attempt by Nordstrom to divert attention from its problems.
   ``I don't think it's serious,'' said Joe Peterson, president of
UFCW Local 1001 in Seattle.
   Nordstrom, an upscale department store retailer with a
near-legendary reputation for customer service, has been embroiled
in a bitter fight with the UFCW over labor relations and pay
practices.
   Last month, the state Department of Labor and Industries, acting
on a UFCW complaint, ruled Nordstrom had violated state laws by
failing to pay some employees for attending meetings, delivering
merchandise, checking inventory, writing thank-you notes to
customers, and doing other chores outside normal working hours.
   Later, the NLRB accused the company of bypassing the union and
bargaining directly with employees over whether they are owed back
wages. Union complaints on other issues remain under NLRB review.
   The union also filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the company
of wage and hour violations.
   Since June 1989, Nordstrom has been seeking changes in contracts
with locals 367 and 1001 in Seattle to allow employees to choose
whether to join the union. The UFCW only represents employees in
the Seattle and Tacoma area, out of 60 Nordstrom stores and 30,000
employees in six states.
   In a news release Sunday, the store said that position ``ignited
the union's expensive, nationally funded smear campaign against
Nordstrom.''
   ``It is apparent that many of our employees are unhappy with
their union and feel the UFCW has been inaccurately representing
their views,'' said Joe Demarte, Nordstrom's corporate personnel
director. ``They have been forced to take matters into their own
hands.
   ``We hope an election date will be set promptly, although we
fully anticipate the union will file a string of unfair labor
practice charges to delay and block the decertification process.''
   Peterson had said earlier that the union was preparing more
federal labor charges after receiving complaints of management
pressure to sign statements supporting Nordstrom, to participate in
rallies for the company and to join the decertification campaign.
   ``Nordstrom is attempting to divert attention from its problems
by suggesting its employees don't support our efforts,'' Peterson
said. ``The fact is most Nordstrom employees have gone underground
in fear of reprisals or of being blacklisted.''
   NLRB spokesman Larry McCargar said the agency probably would not
act on any decertification petitions until pending unfair labor
practices complaints are resolved.

shutdown to Thursday sted Friday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seabrook nuclear power plant operators
brought the reactor past 5 percent power for the first time as they
gear up for long-delayed commercial operation.
   Opponents, meanwhile, are preparing another appeal they hope
will pull the plug on the $6.5 billion plant.
   Seabrook initially was planned to generate electricity
commercially in 1979 at a fraction of the cost but was completed in
1986 and licensed only this month.
   Plant operators brought the 1,150-megawatt reactor above 5
percent power Sunday evening, spokesman Ron Sher said. During
low-power atomic testing in June the reactor remained below 5
percent power.
   Sher said power would stay between 8 percent and 10 percent for
several weeks to test turbines that will drive electrical
generators. Seabrook officials have estimated it would take two to
three months to bring the reactor to 100 percent power.
   After repeated construction cost overruns and regulatory delays
focusing largely on evacuation plans for crowded beaches less than
two miles from the plant, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
approved Seabrook's commercial license on March 1.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington declined to
block the license on March 14, though it has yet to rule on
Seabrook opponents' appeals. The commission signed the license the
next day and plant operators started the reactor Tuesday.
   Operators briefly shut down the reactor Thursday because of a
false electrical alarm. A commission inspector called the shutdown
conservative.
   A tardy shutdown during last year's low-power testing is the
subject of an appeal that Seabrook foes will argue before an NRC
panel this week.
   New Hampshire Yankee, Seabrook's operator, acknowledged
improperly delaying the shutdown after a valve malfunctioned June
22, and plant management was realigned. But Seabrook officials said
it was an isolated problem.
   An NRC Atomic Safety and Licensing Board ruled in October that
the delayed shutdown was not a ``significant safety issue,'' and
rejected a request by Massachusetts officials for new hearings on
Seabrook management and training.
   Six Massachusetts communities lie within Seabrook's 10-mile
evacuation-planning zone, and state officials oppose the plant.
   The Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and the New England Coalition
on Nuclear Pollution are joining Massachusetts in appealing the
licensing board ruling. An NRC Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal
Board plans to hear the opponents' oral arguments and plant
supporters' replies on Tuesday in Bethesda, Md.

   The nation's savings and loans lost $19.2
billion in 1989, the worst performance ever and the third
consecutive record, the government said today.
   With a $6.5 billion loss in the final three months of the year,
red ink for all of 1989 easily topped the previous record of $13.4
billion in 1988. That had topped what was then a record of $7.8
billion in 1987.
   But James Freund, acting chief economist of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, offered a glimmer of hope for this year, pointing out
that the bulk of the losses occurred at institutions either taken
over by the government or targeted for takeover.
   ``I would presume by this time next year ... the industry would
be smaller and the losses would be smaller,'' he said.
   In the fourth quarter, for instance, the 485 institutions either
under government control or targeted for government control
compiled all of the industry's losses while the rest of the
industry, 2,393 S&amp;Ls, actually posted a slight profit of $28
million.
   The government's numbers also revealed the cost of the
government's slow start in shutting down failed institutions.
Losses on operations for the 485 totaled $2.6 billion in the
October-December period _ an average loss of $29 million a day.
   Once these institutions are shut down or sold, the industry
would no longer have to absorb that continuing expense. Since
August, the government has disposed of 52 S&amp;Ls and announced plans
recently to close or sell another 140 by the end of June.
   Thrift industry deposits totaled $946 billion at the end of
1989, down $26 billion from a year earlier. Most of the shrinkage
occurred as institutions sold off assets in order to meet tough new
financial standards enacted last August.
   The number of institutions open _ both failed and solvent _
totaled 2,878, down from 2,949 a year ago and from a peak of 3,246
in 1985.
   ``1989 was clearly a year of substantial change and retrenchment
for the thrift industry,'' Freund said.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
dropped by another 15 this week as it continued on its normal
first-quarter pace to total 893, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The decrease in rig activity conforms to previous first quarters
when the count generally is in a decline, according to Ike Kerridge
Jr., an economist for Baker Hughes.
   The year-to-date count, however, remains well ahead of the 1989
tally when 766 rigs were working, Baker Hughes said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely-watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Louisiana showed the greatest
decline for the week, losing nine rigs. California, Wyoming and
Ohio each lost three rigs this week, while North Dakota and Texas
each lost two.
   Oklahoma showed the greatest improvement for the week, adding 10
rigs, while New Mexico added two and Kansas rose by one.
   The number of working rigs in Colorado, Michigan and
Pennsylvania remained unchanged.

<HEAD>Court to Review Ruling on Excluding Child-Bearing Women from Some

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, accepting a case that could
affect millions of working women, said today it will review a
ruling that lets employers exclude all women of child-bearing age
from some hazardous jobs.
   The justices agreed to study an automobile battery
manufacturer's policy of banning women who cannot prove they are
infertile from jobs that expose them to lead.
   A decision is expected sometime in 1991.
   A federal appeals court last year upheld the fetal protection
policy, rejecting arguments that banning women from high-paying, if
hazardous, factory jobs amounts to illegal sex discrimination.
   Exposure to lead, the principal material used in making
batteries, is a health risk to workers and to the fetuses of
pregnant workers.
   Since 1982 the battery division of Johnson Controls Inc., based
in Milwaukee, has barred women at its factories from jobs involving
exposure to lead and from jobs that, through transfers or
promotions, could progress to lead-exposed duties.
   Eight employees and the United Auto Workers union challenged the
policy in court. Among the women who sued was one who had submitted
to sterilization to preserve her job and a 50-year-old divorcee.
   The suit alleged that the policy violated a part of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, called Title VII, barring sexual bias in
employment.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Warren in Milwaukee ruled for
Johnson Controls based on both sides' pretrial arguments. No trial
was held.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his ruling by a 7-4
vote last Sept. 26.
   In other action today, the high court:
   _ Agreed to consider giving federal regulators more authority to
lower electricity rates, setting the stage for a decision that
could affect more than 49 million homes.
   The court said it will review a ruling that barred the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission from slashing rate increases to
customers in 15 Ohio communities.
   _ Agreed to hear an appeal challenging the authority of states
to house convicted murderers on ``death rows'' and keep them apart
from other inmates.
   The justices said they will review the appeal of Nebraska death
row inmate John Rust, who says such segregation is ``without
penological justification'' and ``grossly disproportionate''
punishment.
   _ Agreed to review a ruling that, if upheld, could reinstate
forced busing for the racial desegregation of Oklahoma City, Okla.,
elementary schools.
   The court must decide whether the city school board acted
lawfully when in 1985 it returned to a neighborhood schools plan
for children in kindergarten through fourth grade.
   _ Refused to revive a lawsuit stemming from one of the nation's
most publicized cases of alleged child abuse, at the now-defunct
McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, Calif.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit against a private child welfare group and one of its
therapists by two of the preschool's former teachers.
   _ Refused to extend a key civil rights law to protect
non-citizens from private, as well as governmental, bias.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling that
the First National Bank of Commerce in New Orleans did not
discriminate illegally against Jeetendra Bhandari when it denied
his application for a bank credit card because he is not a U.S.
citizen.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a leading conglomerate found to have
fraudulently obtained a $75 million bank loan to develop natural
gas fields in Mississippi.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that could
subject W.R. Grace &amp; Co. to major punitive damages in a lawsuit by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   In the fetal-protection case, Judge John L. Coffey wrote for the
appeals court that the differing treatment of women employees was
based on a ``business necessity,'' and added, ``We are also
convinced that Johnson Controls' fetal protection policy could be
upheld under the bona fide occupational qualification defense.''
   The appeals court concluded that the policy ``is reasonably
necessary to industrial safety.''
   Three of the appeals court's four dissenting judges wrote
opinions, the most scathing of which was authored by Judge Frank
Easterbrook, a conservative appointee of President Ronald Reagan.
   Calling it ``likely the most important sex-discrimination case
in any court since ... Congress enacted Title VII,'' Easterbrook
said, ``If the majority is right, then by one estimate 20 million
industrial jobs would be closed to women, for many substances in
addition to lead pose fetal risks.''
   ``The law would allow employers to consign more women to
`women's work' while reserving better-paying but more hazardous
jobs for men,'' Easterbrook said. ``Title VII was designed to
eliminate rather than perpetuate such matching of sexes to jobs.''
   He added: ``Cases ... show that many additional women are
affected by restrictions placed on other jobs, such as the X-ray
technician jobs that exposed embryos to radiation. Concern about
emissions from computers and their terminals has led to proposals
that could restrict access even to traditional office jobs.''
   Johnson Controls has battery plants in several states.
   A California appeals court recently ruled that the fetal
protection policy is illegal sex discrimination under state, not
federal, law.
   The case is International Union vs. Johnson Controls, 89-1215.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Mixed After Lower Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after opening
lower amid a raft of bearish developments and expectations.
   Crop weather in South America and the United States continued to
improve over the weekend, prompting some of the initial selling.
   A sharp drop in gold prices and a strong surge in the dollar
this morning also were viewed as negative for grain and soybean
prices since a stronger dollar tends to discourage export sales.
   Analysts and traders also linked early selling to speculation
that Soviet-Lithuanian tensions could hurt the Soviet Union's
chances of receiving most-favored trade status from the United
States.
   Trading this week is expected to be influenced by profit-taking
as traders even up their positions ahead of Friday's USDA
planting-intentions report.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1 cent lower to }
cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.57{ a
bushel; corn futures were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at
$2.59{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1\ cents higher with May at
$1.49 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with May
$5.99} a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork-belly futures were sharply higher.
   Live cattle futures were .12 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
June at 72.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .13
cent higher with March at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .13
cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 53.62 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 1.03 cents higher with May at
52.95 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

<TEXT>
   A French steelmaker has expressed an interest in
buying a minority stake in LTV Corp.'s steel unit, LTV announced
today.
   LTV said the offer from Usinor Sacilor of France, Europe's
largest steelmaker, was unsolicited and that no negotiations have
been held or are scheduled.
   LTV is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   ``We will explore at the proper time and under the proper
circumstances a business relationship between LTV Steel and Usinor
Sacilor,'' said LTV chairman and chief executive officer Raymond A.
Hay. ``This is a normal and appropriate endeavor for a company
going through the Chapter 11 reorganization process.''
   Usinor Salcinor is the second largest steelmaker in the world,
operating three facilities in France and two in West Germany.
   LTV Steel is the third largest domestic steelmaker and the
largest producer of flat rolled steel products for the automotive
industry.
   The two companies, which currently have a technology exchange
relationship, are discussing a confidentiality agreement as a
prelude to any purchase, LTV said.
   LTV Corp. is a diversified manufacturing company in steel,
aerospace-defense and energy products. The company filed for
reorganization in 1986, citing heavy losses in the steelmaking
division.

<HEAD>Two Biggest Dutch Banks Start Merger Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nations' two largest
commercial banks, Amro Bank and Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN), have
begun merger talks aimed at eventually creating the world's
20th-largest bank, officials of both companies announced Monday.
   The merger would transform the two banks into a conglomerate
that could act as a global player using the entire European
Community as its home base, according to ABN chief R. Hazelhoff.
   But claiming that the talks were still in an embryonic stage,
bank officials refrained from providing details on the projected
merger, which surprised the Dutch financial world.
   With reported assets of 180 billion guilders, or $90 billion,
Amro Bank ranks as this nation's largest commercial bank, while ABN
ranks second with assets reportedly totaling 173 billion guilders,
or $86.5 billion.
   ``Based upon recent developments in the markets for financial
services, we are of the opinion that concentration of forces of
forces is strongly advisable,'' the two banks said in a statement.
   ``Such a concentration will mean a stronger basis for our
position in several segments of the domestic market,'' according to
the statement. ``Internationally, as a result of both Europe 1992
and developments outside Europe, an important strengthening can be
attained through a merger.''
   Last year, a merger between Amro Bank and the Belgian Societe
Generale de Banque foundered on what the Dutch bank called cultural
differences.
   That planned merger was also inspired by the expected
concentration of financial forces in the fully integrated European
market, which is expected to be established by 1992.
   At present, ABN, which employs 32,000 people, has 711 offices in
the Netherlands and 269 offices in foreign countries. Amro Bank has
762 offices in the Netherlands and 106 offices abroad, its payroll
totalling 24,000 employees.
   Based on assets, the new combination would rank as the world's
20th-largest commercial bank just behind the Deutsche Bank of West
Germany, according to figures provided by the trade journal
Institutional Investor.

   Weight loss clinics need closer scrutiny by
the Federal Trade Commission, a congressman said today as he opened
hearings to investigate the growing fat-fighting industry.
   ``Most lay counselors and specialists in commercial diet clinics
are undertrained lay people operating without any medical
supervision,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   He said products sold in such clinics are untested, with little
or no scientific proof of their safety and effectiveness.
   Officials of major commercial weight-loss programs declined to
testify, the subcommittee staff said before the hearing.
   Wyden told FTC chairwoman Janet Steiger that he wanted her
agency to check weight-loss clinics for possible fraud and to work
with state attorneys general and other consumer fraud agencies to
police them.
   Steiger, who was the first witness before Wyden's House Small
Business subcommittee on regulation, said her agency has been
trying to weed out the most outrageous of the weight-loss schemes _
diet pills that are supposed to make you thinner while you sleep,
for example.
   ``Now we're taking a closer look at the weight loss clinics,''
she said.
   She advocated consumer education and said a task force within
her agency is trying to find ways the federal government can
coordinate with state government.
   ``We are encouraging state criminal enforcement where it is
appropriate,'' she said.
   Witnesses included women who had had medical problems after
going to weight loss clinics.
   A subcommittee staff report on the diet industry said that
despite optimistic claims, an estimated 90 percent of all dieters
who lose 25 pounds in a diet program regain the weight within two
years.
   It said Americans spent $33 billion on weight loss in 1989,
one-third of it for diet clinics alone. It cited a warning by the
American Medical Association that some diet formulas could lead to
complications and even fatalities among dieters.
   ``The worrisome trend is away from exercise and toward liquid
protein diets, virtually all of them sponsored by physicians and
hospitals, and so-called fast diets, which ignore nutritional
safety,'' the report said.
   Much of the growth in the industry has been due to heavy
advertising, which the FTC has largely ignored, the report said.
   The Food and Drug Administration has authority to regulate the
diet products.
   ``But in reality, few if any of these diet gadgets, drugs or
food have been tested for safety and effectiveness before patients
and consumers become unsuspecting guinea pigs,'' the staff report
said.
   It contended that many so-called diet experts, including
physicians, have little knowledge about how to treat obesity. The
products are often sold by people whose principal training is in
sales, not nutrition or medicine, it said.
   The report cited industry research estimating the nation has 65
million dieters, including half of all women. It said 60 percent of
all women are usually dieting in some form, and 18 percent of all
adults are constantly dieting; 25 percent of American adults are
obese and 13 percent are severely overweight.

   Prices closed higher on London's Stock Exchange
Monday, boosted by increased institutional activity, program

   Buying in the stock index futures market also helped propel the

   A stronger pound, a perception that the West German central bank
might not raise its interest rates and a strong start on Wall

   The offer was made through Citibank, which is providing

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is ``negotiating'' but hasn't accepted the
offer, a spokesman said. The advertising agency has said it wishes

   At the company's annual general meeting earlier this month,

   The dollar, boosted by political tension in the
Soviet Union and expectations of continued weakness of the Japanese
yen, finished higher against most major currencies in European
trading Monday.
   Gold prices plunged amid reports of massive gold sales, possibly
by investors in the Middle East. It lost more than $30 an ounce in
Zurich, Switzerland. In early afternoon trading in New York, gold
traded about $20 an ounce lower than Friday's late level.
   Though the dollar moved higher against the major currencies,
European dealers said market activity was generally modest.
   They added that most of the dollar's gains were driven by the
market's continued focus on Soviet Lithuania where a Soviet troop
buildup has raised fears of armed intervention.
   Dealers also noted some disappointment that Japan Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was unable to secure any apparent
monetary concessions from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady during weekend meetings.
   In late afternoon London trading, the dollar was quoted at
1.7155 Deutsche marks, up from 1.7100 marks late Friday.
   The British pound traded at $1.6135, up from $1.6040 late
Friday. The pound also advanced to 2.7680 marks, up from 2.7412
late Friday.
   The dollar rose earlier in Tokyo by 1.33 yen to 156.40 yen, its
highest close since Jan. 13, 1987. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 156.35 yen.
   Other late dollars rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels included: 1.5275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5179; 5.7745 French
francs, up from 5.7645; 1.9267 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9249;
1,261.50 Italian lire, up from 1,258.50; and 1.1748 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1751.
   Gold bullion moved sharply lower in heavy trading. Rumors of
heavy selling swirled around world precious metals markets. The
Saudia Arabian Monetary Agency was rumored to have sold gold and
bought British pounds with the proceeds. Japanese investors were
said to have sold gold to buy stocks.
   Meanwhile, gold also came under pressure from internal market
dynamics as technical indicators triggered selling.
   The metal was quoted at $379.25 a troy ounce in London late
Monday, down from a bid of $386.95 late Friday. In Zurich, the late
afternoon gold bid was $363 an ounce, down from late Friday's
$393.05.
   After gold fell through support levels around $388 and again at
$385, selling accelerated in what some dealers described as a panic.
   ``It was a free-fall after those levels were broken,'' said one
dealer in Zurich.
   Some traders said gold is now vastly oversold, and predicted a a
comeback.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.49 to close at a bid of
$384.94 an ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery was
trading at $368.25 a troy ounce in early afternoon, off $20.60 from
Friday's settlement.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.95 a troy ounce, down
from $5.04 late Friday. It was the first time silver had finished
below $5.00 since June 30, 1986.

<HEAD>Proxy Fight Ended, Two Chartwell Candidates Being Nominated to
Avon Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. and an investment group that
owns 9.9 percent of Avon's common stock announced Monday they had
reached a settlement to end a planned proxy fight by the group.
   The settlement also ends for now a challenge to the big
cosmetics company's existing management by Chartwell Associates, a
limited partnerhip.
   A joint announcement said the Avon board has agreed to nominate
two candidates proposed by Chartwell for election to the board of
directors at the annual meeting in New York on May 3. The board
also will nominate two incumbent Avon directors.
   Under the settlement, the directors will establish a committee
to consider ways of boosting value for Avon stockholders. Members
of the special panel will be James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and
chief executive officer, three incumbent members of the Avon board
and the two Chartwell nominees.
   The panel will examine alternatives to maximize value, such as a
recapitalization, asset sales, an outright sale of Avon or a
leveraged buyout.
   Another key element of the settlement is the resignation of John
P. Rochon as vice chairman of Mary Kay Corp., parent of Mary Kay
Cosmetics, which is a Dallas-based rival of Avon's in the direct
sales business. Rochon will become a consultant to Avon for a year
and report to Preston.
   His assignment will be to assist the special committee, Avon
spokesman John Cox said.
   Rochon is a principal of Chartwell, an investment group which
owns about 7.5 percent of Avon's voting shares, or roughly 9.9
percent of the company's outstanding common stock.
   Chartwell recently launched a proxy fight to win four seats on
Avon's 11-member board. Proxy fights essentially are attempts by
outsiders to overthrow a company's management by obtaining enough
proxies to influence a corporate election. A proxy is the legal
right to exercise a shareholder's vote.
   Given the amount of Avon stock held by investors potentially
hostile to management, it had appeared probable that Chartwell
would succeed in capturing at least two seats if it continued to
wage its proxy battle. The terms of the Avon-Chartwell settlement
therefore recognize the inevitable while averting the expenses a
proxy contest would have entailed.
   In addition to Rochon, other partners in Chartwell include
members of the Fisher real estate family of New York and Gordon P.
Getty, the oil heir. The Chartwell candidates who will be nominated
to Avon's board are Anthony Fisher and Marc E. Leland, representing
the Getty interests.
   Commenting on the settlement, Chartwell said: ``We believe that
our agreement with Avon serves the best interests of all Avon
stockholders. We look forward to working with Jim Preston and
sharing ideas with him and with our fellow directors.''
   Incumbent Avon board members who will be up for re-election are
Preston and Charles S. Locke, chairman and chief executive officer
of Morton International Inc. The incumbents not standing for
election again are Emil Mosbacher Jr., an investor and independent
oil and gas producer, and Merlin Nelson, former vice chairman of
AMF Inc.
   Last year Avon, the world's biggest direct selling company, drew
several unsolicited takeover proposals. In rejecting the offers,
Avon speeded up its plans to improve profitability and focus on its
core direct selling operations. Avon sales representatives market
gifts, cosmetics, jewelry and other items.
   Avon earned $54.6 million in 1989 after a deficit of $404.5
million in 1988 when it had $546.6 million in losses from
discontinued operations.
   Other major holders of Avon stock include Minneapolis investor
Irwin Jacobs and a group led by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.

<HEAD>Disney Says Response to No-Ad Policy Has Been Overwhelming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. says moviegoers are
applauding its refusal to show its films in theaters that run
on-screen ads first.
   Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures
Distribution, said anyone who ever heard an audience hiss the ads
knows how unpopular they are. He said the depth of that hatred came
out in overwhelming praise after Disney announced its policy last
month.
   ``We had five boxloads of letters,'' Cook said.
   Some theaters have been showing no ads. Others have been, at
least when non-Disney movies are playing.
   For example, the nation's largest theater chain, the
Denver-based 2,700-screen United Artists Theater Circuit, announced
last week it would go along with the advertising ban, but only on
screens where Disney films are shown.
   No other movie distributors have joined Disney's no on-screen
advertising policy.
   ``I applaud the policy as a consumer,'' 20th Century Fox
marketing and distribution chief Tom Sherak said. ``But it's not up
to me to tell them (theater owners) that they should or shouldn't
do it. It has to come from their patronage.''
   Sherak suggested that angering audiences may cost theater owners
more than they make in ad revenue.
   ``Exhibitors should sit in their theaters and see what the
public sees. They might see that they might be hurting themselves
in the long run,' he said.
   Some observers believe Disney has a big extra motive for wanting
no ads to be shown. Its arch-rival, MCA-Universal, has been running
ads for its Universal Studios Florida theme park in most of the
1,930 theaters operated by Cineplex Odeon.
   The studio tour is a head-to-head competitor with the nearby
Walt Disney World complex. MCA owns 50 percent of Toronto-based
Cineplex Odeon.
   Cook, the Disney distribution chief, denied the MCA ads
motivated Disney's policy. ``The impetus was not any one ad in
particular.''
   The exception to the ban is slide ads for soft drinks, car
washes and the like, which Disney says may be shown when the
theater lights are up during intermission and before the show
starts.
   Also, Disney is allowing existing contracts to be honored. So
some viewers of Disney's new release ``Pretty Woman'' may have seen
commercials over the weekend.
   But when the ad contracts run out, Disney says theater owners
must cave in to its demands _ or do without its pictures.

   Rising prices and growing demand soon will
push the U.S. bill for imported oil higher than the nation's 1990
trade deficit, former Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger told
Congress Monday.
   ``There is a strong possibility of a 30 percent or 40 percent
increase in prices'' in the 1990s, Schlesinger said in presenting
the Senate Energy Committee a gloomy summary of the world oil
outlook.
   ``That we will have a price surge in the decade seems to me to
be beyond question.''
   U.S. demand for oil will grow by about 2 percent a year until
there are steep price increases, Schlesinger said. In a recent
month, he added, the United States had to rely on foreign sources
to meet a record 54 percent of its oil demand.
   Schlesinger, also a former secretary of defense and director of
the Central Intelligence Agency, said that U.S. imports should
reach as much as 11 million barrels a day by 1995, compared with a
net average of just over 7 million barrels a day in 1989.
   ``The oil-import bill then will likely exceed our present trade
deficit,'' he said.
   The 1990 trade deficit is about $100 billion.
   ``That statement, if correct, is of profoundest concern to the
U.S. economy,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the
committee.
   While domestic demand for oil has been growing, Schlesinger
said, U.S. production continues to fall. Drilling activity is low
by historical standards, he said, and the giant Prudhoe Bay field
in Alaska is in declining production.
   ``Dependency (on foreign oil) will continue to grow, although
the pace can still be affected by our policy decisions,''
Schlesinger said.
   While the U.S. appetite for imported oil grows toward 65
percent, ``the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (our chief surviving
element of protection against a cutoff) will have shrunk in real
terms from roughly 100 days to 60 days of imports,'' he said.
   ``We may as well acknowledge that over the past decade the
United States as a practical matter abandoned the quest for energy
independence _ indeed, even the quest for low energy dependency,''
Schlesinger said. ``If we are to limit our future vulnerability,
either for national security or international financial reasons, we
shall have to reverse course _ and take vigorous action.''
   Schlesinger's formula for reducing imports includes increased
conservation, more tax incentives for domestic producers and
expanded drilling.
   Relying on renewable energy sources _ such as solar energy _
will not solve the problem because those sources do little for
transportation, which is responsible for the growth in demand for
oil, he said.
   Despite relaxed East-West tensions and the end of the Iran-Iraq
war, Schlesinger said, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be
increased from the present 750-million-barrel supply to 1 billion
barrels.
   John J. Easton Jr., an assistant secretary of energy, was less
pessimistic about the growth of oil imports and oil prices.
   ``Through concerted efforts to find and produce more of our
domestic resources, we may be able to slow the rate of decline in
U.S. production, but it is unlikely under current conditions that
we will be able to reverse the trend,'' Easton said.

   The savings and loan industry lost a record
$19.17 billion in 1989 after posting its worst fourth-quarter loss,
the government reported Monday.
   Analysts said the erosion would continue this year, although at
a slower pace.
   The fourth-quarter loss totaled $6.5 billion, up from $4.97
billion in the July-September period, and pushed the yearly total
to a third consecutive record deficit.
   The red ink was $13.4 billion in 1988 and $7.8 billion in 1987.
   James Freund, acting chief economist of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said most of the losses were suffered by institutions
that have either been taken over by the government or are scheduled
to be taken over under the S&amp;L bailout law passed by Congress in
August.
   ``OTS is carrying out (the bailout law) mandate of weeding out
the insolvent and unsalvageable institutions that are compiling the
big losses, and transferring them to the RTC's control for eventual
sale or liquidation,'' Freund said.
   The RTC, or Resolution Trust Corp., is charged in the bailout
legislation with disposing of the failed institutions. It has
gotten rid of 52 S&amp;Ls and announced plans recently to close or sell
another 140 by the end of June.
   The RTC has been criticized recently for not acting quickly
enough in disposing of the troubled S&amp;Ls. Freund said that failure
to shut down the institutions cost the government $2.6 billion in
the fourth quarter _ an average of $29 million a day.
   However, Freund said ``the industry would be smaller and the
losses would be smaller'' by this time next year.
   ``Despite smaller losses, they're still losses,'' said Bert Ely,
an Alexandria, Va., financial institutions analyst.
   Ely said he saw a ``continuing and disturbing trend ... and that
is a decline in the number (of S&amp;Ls) making money.''
   The OTS reported that 1,818 thrifts not under government control
at year's end reported net earnings of $1.3 billion in the fourth
quarter. That, Ely said, is 88 fewer than the number of profitable
institutions reported in the third quarter.
   The other 779 S&amp;Ls not under government control lost $3.4
billion, bringing to $2.1 billion the total fourth-quarter loss for
all non-conservatorship thrifts.
   The 281 thrifts in conservatorship, or under government control,
at year's end lost $4.4 billion, the OTS said, and the 84 other
institutions transferred to the RTC since Jan. 1 lost $1.8 billion
in the last three months of 1989.
   Another 120 thrifts targeted for transfer to the RTC had losses
of $324 million.
   The thrift industry posted net losses in 33 states, net gains in
15 and no change in two states during the last quarter. The biggest
losses occurred in Texas, $1.5 billion, and in Arizona, $1.4
billion.

   A Harvard University dean was selected
as dean of Stanford University's Graduate School of Business,
university officials announced Monday.
   A. Michael Spence, 46, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, was picked to be the seventh dean of the prestigious
graduate school.
   In his Harvard post, Spence, a former Rhodes Scholar, led 700
faculty members and 9,000 students enrolled in undergraduate
programs, master's, and doctoral programs for all departments
excluding the professional schools.
   Spence's Harvard post, comparable to the role of provost at
other universities, is considered the second most powerful at the
Ivy League institution.
   ``Michael Spence is an extremely able academic administrator,''
said Stanford Provost James N. Rosse. ``The selection committee
developed a clear idea of the kind of leadership it wanted. There
is no doubt we found the person who could carry that role.''
   Spence, an economist who held joint appointments in the
economics department and at the Harvard Business School before
becoming dean, replaces Robert K. Jaedicke, who was stepping down
after six years as Stanford dean to return to teaching and research.
   Spence, who taught at Stanford from 1973-75, takes over a
Stanford business school attended by 660 students in the two-year
MBA program, 42 Sloan Fellows and 84 doctoral students. There are
some 120 faculty members.
   Spence serves on the board of directors of Polaroid Corp. and is
a member of the World Economic Forum.

<HEAD>Soybeans Spurt Higher On Lack Of Brazilian Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade after an expected flood of Brazilian
soybean exports failed to materialize. Grain futures also advanced.
   The soybean market had sold off sharply Friday on speculation
that economic reforms aimed at stemming Brazil's runaway inflation
rate would be implemented over the weekend, causing soybean exports
to resume after a week-long lull.
   But the Brazilian economic picture remained muddled Monday and
analysts said there was no appreciable increase in farmer sales or
export shipments of Brazilian soybeans.
   ``Everybody's holding on to their tangible assets until the
picture is clearer,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the gain in soybeans was ``strictly a Brazil
play'' helped by technically inspired buying as prices rose.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were unchanged to 3 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.59} a bushel;
corn was { cent to 2\ cents higher with May at $2.60} a bushel;
oats were { cent to 2 cents higher with May at $1.49} a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents to 8{ cents higher with May at $6.03{ a

   NACCO Industries Inc. said Monday it plans to
combine its Procter-Silex Inc. subsidiary with Hamilton Beach, an
appliance-making subsidiary of Glen Dimplex of the Republic of
Ireland.
   NACCO Industries, based in Cleveland, would own 65 percent of
the new company and Glen Dimplex would own 35 percent, NACCO said
in a statement.
   The combined sales of Procter-Silex and Hamilton Beach would be
about $350 million annually, company officials said.
   The agreement is subject to approval of government agencies and
the NACCO board of directors.
   ``This is an excellent business combination,'' said Ward Smith,
chairman and chief executive officer of NACCO Industries. ``Our
product lines are compatible and complementary. Furthermore, the
much broader product line will enhance our position in a highly
competitive market.''
   Smith said that because of brand-name recognition of certain
appliances, the new business would not change brand names of
products.
   Hamilton Beach was acquired by Glen Dimplex in 1985 and makes
small electric appliances such as blenders, food processors and
mixers.
   It has plants in Clinton, N.C., and Washington, N.C., its
headquarters.
   NAACO's Procter-Silex subsidiary, based in Richmond, Va.,
produces small electric appliances such as toasters, irons and
coffeemakers. It has two North Carolina plants, in Southern Pines
and Mt. Airy, and a plant in Juarez, Mexico.
   NACCO Industries, a holding company, has two other major
subsidiaries. They are Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Inc., which
designs, manufactures and markets forklift trucks and related
parts, and the North American Coal Corp., which mines and markets
coal for electric utilities.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Could Get Worse, Administration Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit is not expected to
improve in the next two years to the extent that it did in the past
two and it could worsen, the Bush administration said Monday.
   The administration said that achieving additional reductions in
America's trade imbalance would depend on a variety of factors _
from the growth rate in foreign countries to the value of the
dollar on foreign currency markets.
   Given the forecasting uncertainties, the administration said it
could not rule out the possibility that the trade deficit would
actually worsen in the next two years.
   It did not forecast an actual deficit figure.
   The administration's assessment was included in its ``Annual
Trade Projection Report to Congress'' which is required under the
1988 trade law.
   The administration said it was possible that further progress
will be made in reducing the gap between exports and imports, but
it said any improvements would be at a slower pace than in 1988 and
1989, two years when rapid growth in export sales helped to boost
the country's economic fortunes.
   The merchandise trade imbalance declined to $109 billion in
1989, its lowest level since 1984, after hitting an all-time high
of $152 billion in 1987. But many private economists are warning
that the deficit will begin rising again this year, reflecting
slower growth in U.S. export sales.

   Gold prices plummeted as much as $30 an ounce
Monday in hectic selling linked to the dollar's strength and
intensified by rumors of heavy sales by large international
investors.
   Another dollar advance against the Japanese yen stoked the
bearish attitude toward gold that has been building for weeks.
   Several negative forces joined to jolt gold. An unconfirmed
report of a huge sale by Saudi Arabia plus rumored selling by
Japanese and Soviet parties had a domino effect on precious metals
markets as other investors dumped gold to beat further price
declines.
   ``My guess is that there's been pretty widespread selling ...
based on a technically bearish chart picture and expectations of
continued strength in the U.S. dollar, which has been the main
culprit in gold's weakness for several weeks,'' said Jeffrey A.
Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc. in
Toronto.
   Gold for March delivery closed at $365.80 a troy ounce on New
York's Commodity Exchange, $23.10 lower than Friday's settlement
price. Later, Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy
ounce of gold at $366.75, down $22.35 from Friday's late bid.
   Gold tumbled to $363 an ounce in Zurich, Switzerland, from
$393.05 late Friday. Gold was quoted at $379.25 an ounce late
Monday in London, down from $386.95 late Friday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold fell $5.49 to close at a bid of $384.94 an ounce.
   Among the rumored big sellers was the Saudia Arabian Monetary
Agency, which was said to have bought British pounds with the
proceeds from selling an estimated 3 million troy ounces. The
agency acts as the country's central bank and is the main
repository of hard currencies and gold reserves.
   Japanese institutions reportedly unloaded gold to raise cash for
buying stocks. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index soared by
nearly 5 percent Monday in its second-biggest single-day rise ever,
rebounding slightly from this year's severe slump.
   It has been widely assumed that the Japanese had been selling
gold for months, possibly to cover stock losses.
   Market reports also said the Soviet Union sold gold to raise
money to help it cope with economic difficulties.
   John P. Norris, manager of the precious metals department at
Citibank in New York, said returns on currencies have become
increasingly attractive due to rising interest rates.
   ``There has been liquidation by large gold investors to take
advantage of higher yields elsewhere,'' he said.
   Silver also was under pressure. Silver for March delivery fell
to $4.955 a troy ounce on New York's Comex from $5.043 Friday.
Earlier in London, silver fell to a bid of $4.95 an ounce from
$5.04 late Friday, marking the first time silver closed below $5 an
ounce there since June 30, 1986.
   The dollar has been bid up due to speculation that U.S. interest
rates will remain at present levels or higher. There is a
perception the Federal Reserve won't nudge rates down because
economic growth appears adequate while inflationary pressures
persist.
   Tension in the Soviet Union over the Lithuanian independence
movement and forecasts of further weakness in the Japanese yen also
have driven up the dollar.
   The dollar rose to 156.70 yen in New York from 154.30 yen late
Friday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose by 1.33 yen to 156.40 yen Monday,
its highest close since Jan. 13, 1987. Later in London, the dollar
was quoted at 156.35 yen.
   The British pound, benefiting from the reported Saudi sterling
purchase, strenghthened to $1.6185 in New York from $1.6010 on
Friday. Sterling traded late in London at $1.6135, up from $1.6040
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.7075 West German marks, down from 1.7135;
1.5205 Swiss francs, up from 1.5200; 5.7480 French francs, down
from 5.7720; 1,256.00 Italian lire, down from 1,260.25; and 1.17595
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17505.
   Rates for the dollar late in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels, included: 1.7155 West German marks, up from 1.7100; 1.5275
Swiss francs, up from 1.5179; 5.7745 French francs, up from 5.7645;
1.9267 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9249; 1,261.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,258.50; and 1.1748 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1751.

   Philips Display Components Co. said
Monday it will build a $100 million television picture tube plant
at Saline, about 10 miles south of its Ann Arbor headquarters.
   Construction will start in July on the plant aimed at keeping
the subsidiary of Dutch electronics giant NV Philips in the
high-definition television race. It will be completed early in
1992, said Dr. Iva Wilson, Philips Display Components president.
   The 400,000-square-foot plant is designed to produce 1 million
27-inch color picture tubes a year and make HDTV tubes in the
future.
   Philips Display Components is the top maker of picture tubes,
with 70 percent of its production going to Philips Consumer
Electronics products including the Magnavox, Sylvania and Philco
television brands.
   It also provides tubes for television makers such as Sharp,
Toshiba, NEC, JVC, Hitachi, MIC and the Korean Gold Star and
Samsung brands.
   The company moved its headquarters last year from Seneca Falls,
N.Y. The Ann Arbor facility develops products for manufacture at a
plant in Ottawa, Ohio.
   The new plant won't affect operations at the Ottawa facility,
which employs about 2,000 people, Wilson said.
   The picture tubes are assembled into televisions by another
subsidiary, Philips Consumer Electronics, in Greenville, Tenn.
   The Federal Communications Commission said last week it expected
to set a standard for HDTV broadcasting by spring 1993.
   HDTV produces a sharper video image than conventional television
and compact-disc quality sound.
   The FCC said it favored systems sending HDTV signals on separate
channels from conventional programming.
   Philips Consumer Electronics said in January it was entering
into a joint venture with a unit of France's Thomson SA and the
National Broadcasting Co. to look at such a system.
   Zenith Electronics Corp., the last major U.S.-based television
maker, is working with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on that
type of system.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Nosedive On Huge Overseas Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices were swamped Monday by a tidal wave of
selling that apparently began in the Middle East and swept through
markets around the world, eroding prices to their lowest levels in
more than five months.
   On other commodity markets, soybean futures surged; grains were
higher; copper futures fell; pork bellies rose sharply while
livestock futures were mixed; and energy futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $23.20 to $25 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at $366.20 a troy
ounce, the lowest gold settlement price on the exchange since Oct.
13.
   Silver futures prices fell 8.8 cents to 10.7 cents in New York
with the March contract settling at $4.955 a troy ounce, the first
close below $5 since mid-1986.
   Analysts agreed the collapse was sparked by an overseas sale of
as much as 1 million ounces of gold bullion, a huge amount, by a
single source.
   Rumors were rampant but many experts traced the initial sale to
the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency or to a commercial bank in Saudi
Arabia that may have sold gold and bought British pounds.
   Another view was that China was the initial seller, exchanging
gold for hard currency.
   Major investors quickly followed suit, analysts said, pouring up
to 2 million more ounces of gold onto the market.
   ``We had three million ounces hitting the market at a time it
was structurally a little weak anyway, and knocked it all to
hell,'' said George Milling-Stanley, first vice president in charge
of bullion sales at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Spot gold prices fell sharply amid heavy selling in Zurich,
Switzerland, and ``panic selling'' in London before the New York
market opened, said Don Tierney, an analyst with Stanley Bell &amp; Co.
in New York.
   At midday, the Commodity Exchange announced it was raising by
$700 to $2,100 the speculative margin, or downpayment, needed to
play the gold market, forcing further selling by traders who could
not afford the extra margin.
   Tierney said some traders who would normally have been rolling
their positions out of the soon-to-expire April contract and into
the June contract chose instead to get out of the market entirely
``to see how far this thing is going to go.''
   Some experts predicted a rebound on Tuesday but opinions varied
greatly.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co,
said the market was oversold. But he also said that the fact the
April contract closed below its previous low of $370 ``is not a
healthy sign.''
   Soybean futures rose strongly on the Chicago Board of Trade
after an expected crush of Brazilian soybean exports failed to
materialize. Grain futures also advanced.
   The soybean market had sold off sharply Friday on speculation
that economic reforms aimed at stemming Brazil's runaway inflation
rate would be implemented over the weekend, causing soybean exports
to resume after a week-long lull.
   But the Brazilian economic picture remained muddled Monday and
analysts said there was no appreciable increase in farmer sales or
export shipments of Brazilian soybeans.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 2\ cents higher with May at
$3.59 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2\ cents higher with May at
$2.60} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with May at
$1.49{ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 7{ cents higher with May
at $6.03{ a bushel.
   Copper futures fell sharply on the Commodity Exchange on news
that union workers at two state-owned copper refineries in Peru had
postponed a planned two-day work stoppage. Copper settled 2 cents
to 3.3 cents lower with March at $1.262 a pound.
   Pork-belly futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
reaction to Friday's monthly Agriculture Department cold-storage
report showing a smaller stockpile of frozen bellies than the
market had expected.
   Frozen pork-belly futures settled .80 cent to 1.67 cents higher
with May at 53.27 cents a pound; live cattle were .12 cent lower to
.27 cent higher with June at 72.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were unchanged to .22 cent higher with March at 82.87 cents a
pound; live hog futures were .28 cent lower to .27 cent higher with
April at 53.47 cents a pound.
   In lackluster trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West
Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 7 cents higher with
May at $20.46 a barrel; heating oil was .31 cent to .78 cent lower
with April at 54.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .01 cent
lower to .26 cent higher with April at 57.70 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices ended narrowly mixed in
light trading Monday, with little fresh news to stir the market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 7
cents to $20.46 a 42-gallon barrel. Later months had smaller gains.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, regular unleaded
gasoline for delivery in April edged up 0.04 cent to 57.70 cents a
gallon, May added 0.23 cent to 63.77 cents and June moved up 0.26
cent to 63.03 cents a gallon.
   Contracts for later delivery closed mixed.
   No. 2 heating oil for April, meanwhile, fell 0.78 cent to 54.68
cents a gallon, May declined 0.61 cent to 53.06 cents and June
closed down 0.51 cent at 52.47 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the market was quiet with many traders and
participants attending a National Petroleum Refiners Association
conference in Texas. In addition, many regular participants turned
their attention to the precious metals markets, where prices
tumbled sharply, said James Steel, energy analyst for Refco Inc. in
New York.
   Steel said there were few other clear fundamentals to account
for the market's activity. Most of the day's trading was
concentrated in the products markets, he said.
   ``Players were buying gasoline and selling heating oil for no
particular reason,'' said Steel, in anticipation of bullish
statistics from the American Petroleum Institute.
   Last week's report by the API, the trade association
representing the nation's major refiners, showed a sharp decline in
gasoline supplies. Analysts said this week's gasoline statistics,
scheduled for release Tuesday, are expected to be bullish for the
market again.

   Olympic Federal, ``a little old Midwestern thrift
that wants to stay around another 100 years,'' is trying to ensure
its future by pressing ahead with a lawsuit against federal
regulators, Chairman John J. Lanigan said Monday.
   Olympic, one of about 600 of 2,600 S&amp;Ls nationally that fall
short of federal capital requirements, sued to stop the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision from taking it over. That
suit, initially upheld by a district court judge, threatened to
disrupt the Bush administration's bailout of the thrift industry by
prompting a flood of similar suits.
   However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit moved to avoid such a deluge Friday when it lifted an
injunction against a takeover of Olympic, saying ``the harm to the
public outweighs the harm to (Olympic) in this instance.''
   Olympic officials and attorneys are not upset by the reversal
because the decision prohibits the thrift office from liquidating
the suburban Chicago S&amp;L and selling its $1.1 billion in assets.
   What officials of the Berwyn-based Olympic want from the lawsuit
is about $100 million that they believe the government owes them, a
sum that will enable them to accept a friendly buyout offer, said
Lanigan.
   ``We're not asking for anything that shouldn't be coming to
us,'' he said.
   Olympic also is asking the court to bar the thrift office from
initiating a takeover until after the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. rules on the purchase of the thrift by a bank holding
company, said Olympic attorney Charles J. Cooper.
   The government has taken over more than 120 S&amp;Ls since the
bailout began and is expected to seize as many as 200 more
institutions.
   Olympic contends that last year's S&amp;L bailout legislation
unfairly wiped out an accounting measure known as ``supervisory
good will,'' dropping Olympic below the capital requirements,
Cooper said.
   Before the S&amp;L legislation, the government permitted an
institution that bought an insolvent thrift to count as capital the
difference between assets and liabilities of the failed S&amp;L, Cooper
said. That amount, known as supervisory good will, was to
amortized, or written off, over time.
   At least four lawsuits have been filed against the government
protesting the reversal on good will, said thrift office spokesman
Paul Lockwood.
   Olympic took over seven insolvent S&amp;Ls in the early 1980s and
tallied $160 million in good will, to be written off over about 40
years, Lanigan said. Writing off $6 million per year, the thrift
now has $115 in good will _ capital that no longer counts.
   ``They took what we used to count as an asset on our balance
sheet _ all we want to say is, reimburse us,'' Lanigan said.
   Olympic's lawsuit seeks the restoration of the good will
accounting measure or a government reimbursement.
   The thrift's suitor, whom Lanigan declined to name, is willing
to inject $30 million to $40 million into Olympic if the good will
is restored or reimbursed by the government, Lanigan said.
   ``No investor is going to come in and buy an asset that isn't
recognized by the government,'' he said.
   Another court hearing on Olympic's suit is set for April 11.
   Olympic's suit also challenged the constitutionality of
takeovers on the grounds that the director appointed as part of the
bailout legislation and his replacement were not nominated by the
president and confirmed by the Senate as provided by the
Constitution.
   It was on these grounds that the district court judge barred the
federal takeover of Olympic.
   That argument would be moot for Olympic if T. Timonty Ryan Jr.,
a former Labor Department attorney, is confirmed as thrift office
director. Ryan has been nominated for a five-year term and the
Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing for
Wednesday.

   Overweight people need better government
protection from weight-loss clinics that advertise slimness but
deliver health problems, a congressman investigating diet programs
said Monday.
   ``This subcommittee has found the medical field riddled with
hucksters who ply their dubious wares and their miracle cures while
government regulators sit snoozing on the sidelines,'' said Rep.
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation.
   Witnesses who said diet clinics caused them or their family
members medical problems told their stoies to the subcommittee. One
woman said she had to have a gall bladder operation after rapidly
losing weight through one clinic.
   Wyden said he was glad to see the Federal Trade Commission going
after the most outrageous of the get-thin schemes, such as diet
pills said to work during sleep, mail order starvation-binge plans
or ear molds that allegedly use an acupuncture-type technique to
reduce appetite.
   But he said a potentially greater threat is the trend toward
commercial weight-loss clinics and physician-supervised diet
programs. He said the FTC is doing nothing about them.
   He also criticized the agency for inaction against ``the new tin
men of television _ the `infomercial,''' lengthy product promotions
often appearing to be documentaries or interview shows.
   ``The American people falsely believe they are well protected
both by government and the ethic of commerce,'' said Wyden.
   He said that, under then-President Reagan, the FTC was
particularly lax about pursuing fraud in diet advertising, leading
to the problem he said exists today.
   ``In the name of promoting competition in health care,'' the
commission ``fostered an environment that left us a buyer-beware
medical marketplace in which the scam artists could claim virtually
anything with impunity _ and did,'' said Wyden.
   Janet Steiger, named to head the FTC by President Bush, said the
commission has been acting against phony weight plans since 1926,
concentrating on the most egregious.
   ``Now we're taking a closer look at the weight loss clinics,''
she said.
   She advocated consumer education and said an agency task force
is trying to find ways the federal government can coordinate its
efforts with state governments.
   ``We are encouraging state criminal enforcement where it is
appropriate,'' she said, listing several court actions taken
against abusers in the 1980s.
   Sherri Steinberg, of Broward County, Fla., said she needed a
gall bladder operation after rapidly losing 28 pounds through a
popular, heavily advertised weight loss center.
   Loretta Pameijer, of Miami, said she paid $2,000 to a diet
clinic, advertised as being supervised by a doctor, so that her
12-year-old daughter could lose 55 pounds in hopes of becoming a
school cheerleader.
   She said the girl lost weight, began eating normally and about a
year later, after a meal at a fast-food restaurant, had a gall
bladder attack that required surgery.
   Mrs. Pameijer said her doctor told her that diets can lead to
gall bladder disease.
   ``I had no idea that any die could do this,'' she said.
   Wyden's staff said officials of major commercial weight loss
clinics would not testify to the subcommittee.
   William Rush, senior vice president of Optifast, a
hospital-based weight loss program, said he asked to testify and
was told he would be scheduled later.
   ``We think we're the good guys,'' he said. ``We only treat
patients who are 30 percent or more over their ideal body weight,
and we treat obesity like a disease.''
   Rush said the type of weight-loss clinics found in shopping
malls are fine for people with only five or 10 pounds to lose.
   About $33 billion was spent in 1989 on diets, said a report
released by the subcommittee.
   ``There are 65 million dieters in this country,'' said the
report. ``Sixty percent of all women are usually dieting in some
form and 18 percent of all adults are constantly dieting.''

   The stock market managed a small gain Monday on
the strength of early buying encouraged by a rally in Japanese
stock prices and a drop in domestic interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 20 points in
the early going, settled for a 3.38 gain at 2,707.66.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
826 up, 664 down and 491 unchanged.
   The recently battered Tokyo stock market began to rebound on
Friday. It surged ahead nearly 5 percent Monday for its second
largest gain on record.
   Analysts said that prompted hopes that turmoil in the Japanese
markets might subside without having caused many ripple effects in
other financial centers around the world.
   At the same time, the dollar continued its recent climb against
the Japanese yen in foreign exchange.
   The U.S. bond market, which has benefited from the dollar's
strength, extended its recent rally, pushing interest rates lower.
   But activity in U.S. stocks set a sluggish pace all day, and as
the session progressed prices failed to hold at their early peaks.
Brokers cited worries about unpleasant surprises in forthcoming
earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 116.11 million
shares, down from 132.07 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 143.14 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $4.29 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

<HEAD>ECC Commissioner Says Treaty Needed To Settle Possible Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and European Economic
Community are considering an international agreement to settle
possible jurisdictional disputes once internal European trade
barriers are removed in 1992, Vice President Sir Leon Brittan of
the European Commission said Monday.
   ``At present there is no means of resolving such a dispute,''
Brittan said. ``I therefore think that we now need to give serious
consideration to the desirability of a treaty or less formal
agreement between the Community and the United States to deal with
such problems.''
   Brittan said the tearing down of non-tariff barriers under a
single integrated market system in 1992 will intensify European
competition with the United States. Such a treaty would pertain to
competition involving mergers within the economic community.
   Brittan, the European Community commissioner in charge of
financial services and competition, made the remarks in a speech to
the EC Chambers of Commerce in New York, where he wound up a
one-week visit to the United States.
   The commission is the joint executive body of the 12 member
countries.
   Brittan said he met with various U.S. Cabinet members and
lawmakers in Washington during his visit, including Assistant
Attorney General James Rill, with whom he discussed the proposed
treaty.
   ``I was encouraged by his positive reaction and we will now be
working up our ideas in detail so that they can be properly
considered on both sides of the Atlantic,'' he said.
   Brittan said the substance of any such agreement would still
have to be formulated.
   ``Such an agreement would provide for information gathering and
exchange and would lay down a detailed procedure for consultations
on cases and issues of common interest,'' he said.
   ``It might even contain an arbitration clause, although the
political difficulties of getting that agreed should not be
underestimated.''

<TEXT>
   Japan has suggested the United States tax more,
wean itself from energy-wasting cars and limit the use of credit
cards among 80 proposals for competing better with the Japanese, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   The proposals were made during recent unofficial talks between
U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators in Warrenton, Va., to discuss
economic reforms aimed at shrinking the trade imbalance, the
Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
   The measures were aimed at cutting the $49 billion U.S. trade
deficit, curbing excessive consumer spending and helping balance
the federal budget, the nationally circulated newspaper said.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry had no comment on the report.
   The aggressive measures proposed by Japan include imposing a
value-added tax, abolishing income tax deductions on housing loans
and building high-speed railways to reduce reliance on inefficient
cars, the newspaper said.
   In the latest round of meetings, dubbed the ``Structural
Impediments Initiative,'' U.S. officials urged Japan to revise
land-use policies, streamline its retail distribution system and
boost consumption of imports through public investment.
   Japanese officials have, in turn, urged the United States to cut
its federal budget deficit, increase savings and investment and
improve worker training and education to boost the competitiveness
of American exports.
   Last week, another Japanese newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, said
Washington gave Japan a list of more than 200 suggestions aimed at
eliminating structural barriers it said prevent foreign companies
from entering Japanese markets.
   The U.S. list included a proposal to increase public works
spending from 6.8 percent to 10 percent of Japan's gross national
product.
   Each nation is to come up with an interim report on the talks in
early April. A final report is expected in July.

<HEAD>Wall Street Drops New York's Credit Rating</HEAD>

   New York's budget woes took a dramatic turn
for the worse Monday as Wall Street's two major rating agencies
lowered the state's credit rating, leaving it with the third worst
rating among the 50 states.
   The credit downgradings could cost New York taxpayers millions
of dollars in higher interest payments on the state's debt. Only
Massachusetts and Louisiana are rated as worse credit risks than
New York now.
   ``We're behind West Virginia, for Christ's sake,'' complained
state Comptroller Edward Regan.
   Regan, a Republican, said he would not help Democratic Gov.
Mario Cuomo and the Legislature balance the books for the coming
budget year by jiggering the contribution formula for the state's
public employee pension system.
   Cuomo has blamed the state's third straight year of fiscal
problems on an unanticipated drop in state revenues stemming from
the 1986 federal Tax Reform Act and the economic slowdown that has
hit the Northeast.
   The state's budget deficit for fiscal 1990, which ends Saturday,
is projected at more than $1 billion and a forecast gap of $1.5
billion for fiscal 1991 ``continues to grow,'' Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. said in announcing its downgrade.
   Both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service Inc.
dropped their credit ratings on the $775 million in short-term
funds the state will borrow on Tuesday to balance this year's
budget. The new ratings are one notch lower than ratings for
budget-balancing loans taken out a year ago.
   Standard &amp; Poor's also went one step further and lowered the
rating on New York's long-term debt by two notches to the lowest
level in state history.
   The agency lowered the ratings because there are no responsible
solutions in sight for New York's ``chronic fiscal imbalance,'' S&amp;P
analyst Hyman Grossman said.
   ``Obviously the situation has gotten materially worse and the
solution is a bigger hurdle than it was only a few months ago,''
Grossman said.
   The move by Standard &amp; Poor's reduced the state's long-term
credit rating from double-A-minus to single-A.
   During the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, when New York City
nearly went bankrupt, Standard &amp; Poor's rated the state's credit at
AA, three notches higher than the new rating.
   But state officials and analysts said the new rating didn't
necessarily indicate that the current fiscal problems are worse
than the crisis of 15 years ago.
   Moody's did not change its long-term credit rating for New York,
but analyst George Leung said the agency would be watching the
state closely. Moody's currently gives New York a rating of A1,
which is roughly comparable to S&amp;P's new single-A rating.
   ``An A is a mediocre rating,'' Leung said.
   The S&amp;P downgrade affected the state's $3.9 billion in
outstanding general obligation bonds. New York has a total of more
than $20 billion of various types of debt outstanding.
   A lower bond rating typically forces borrowers to pay a higher
interest rate to sell its debt.
   Cuomo said the lower rating on Tuesday's short-term borrowing
alone would cost the state an additional $10 million in interest.
   ``The continuing delay in achieving progress on a new state
budget has now taken its toll on taxpayers, as I have warned for
weeks that it would,'' Cuomo said in a statement.
   Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, also a Democrat, are
locked in a battle with the state Senate's Republican majority over
whether higher taxes are needed to help close the mounting budget
deficit.
   Standard &amp; Poor's criticized Cuomo and legislative leaders for
failing to agree on the size of the state's budget problem and to
devise ``a credible plan to address it in a fiscally responsible
manner.''
   The budget is supposed to be in place by the start of the
state's fiscal year, which begins on Sunday, but that hasn't
happened since 1984.

<HEAD>Consumer Reports: Japanese Cars More Reliable than American</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese cars were the most trouble-free in 1989
and American makes lagged, although Detroit produced a handful of
1989 models that were more dependable than in previous years,
according to Consumer Reports.
   Toyota and Honda led all automakers in producing cars that were
on the road more often than they were in the shop, the magazine
said in its annual car guide, which was in the April issue released
Monday.
   Of the 31 1989 passenger cars that were rated
better-than-average or much better-than-average, 28 were Japanese.
   Meanwhile, all but one of the 33 passenger cars rated
worse-than-average or much worse-than-average were made by the Big
Three automakers _ General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. The Jaguar XJ6 was the only import in one of those
categories.
   The magazine's guide rated GM's 1989 Buick Le Sabre and
Chrysler's 1989 Dodge Spirit@Plymouth Acclaim as
better-than-average in reliability.
   The 1989 Le Sabre's better-than-average rating shows an
improvement over previous years, the magazine said. The 1988 model
was rated as worse-than-average.
   The Spirit and Acclaim, introduced in the 1989 model year,
earned better-than-average scores.
   Consumer Reports based its conclusions on the repair records of
more than 637,000 vehicles between April 1988 and March 1989.
Readers were asked to rate their vehicles' repair record on a
five-point scale: much better than average, better than average,
average, worse than average, and much worse than average.

<HEAD>Norwest Gets Approval To Acquire First Interstate of Wisconsin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norwest Corp. has received approval from the
Federal Reserve to acquire First Interstate Corp. of Wisconsin.
   Under the agreement, announced in September, First Interstate
shareholders will receive Norwest stock with a value of about $215
million.
   First Interstate, Wisconsin's fifth-largest bank holding
company, has 1,250 employees and assets of more than $1.7 billion.
   Under the acquisition, Sheboygan-based First Interstate will
become Norwest-Wisconsin.
   Minneapolis-based Norwest, the state's largest bank, has assets
of about $24.3 billion.
   Norwest spokesman Larry Haeg said no other regulatory approvals
are needed. First Interstate shareholders also have approved the
deal, which is scheduled to close about May 1, Haeg said.
   Norwest also plans to expand with the acquisition of the
50-branch First Minnesota Savings Bank of Minneapolis under a deal
announced in late February. Regulatory approval also is required
for that transaction.
