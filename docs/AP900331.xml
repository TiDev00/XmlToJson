<HEAD>Brother Called Before Grand Jury Investigating Stuart Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matthew Stuart, who exposed his late brother's
plot to kill his pregnant wife, was called Friday before a grand
jury investigating the slaying.
   Stuart was seen leaving the office used by the grand jury, but
his attorney, Nancy Gertner, refused to say if he had testified.
   The case drew widespread attention when it broke dramatically
the night of Oct. 23: A frantic Charles Stuart called police on his
car phone to say his pregnant wife, Carol, had been shot by a
robber.
   Police found the middle-class couple in their car in an inner
city neighborhood near a hospital where they had attended a
birthing class. Mrs. Stuart was fatally wounded, and Stuart himself
had a serious gunshot wound. The baby, delivered prematurely, died
17 days later.
   For days nobody doubted Stuart's story that the family had been
attacked by a black mugger.
   Matthew Stuart provided a dramatic turnaround in the case Jan.
3, when he told authorities his brother had arranged for him to be
at the murder scene.
   He also told investigators he helped dispose of a gun, which
turned out to be the murder weapon.
   Charles Stuart committed suicide Jan. 4 after his brother
implicated him in the crime.
   Yet Matthew Stuart's revelations also raised questions about his
role in the plot. He has insisted he had no prior knowledge that
Mrs. Stuart would be killed, and he said he did not see her body in
the couple's car when Charles Stuart passed him the handbag that
contained the gun.
   Since Stuart's suicide, a Suffolk County grand jury has convened
periodically to piece together details of the plot. Prosecutors
have not said whether charges might be filed.
   Matthew Stuart arrived at the Suffolk County district attorney's
office Friday morning. He was seen with his two sisters, but
Gertner indicated they were only accompanying him to the
courthouse. Both sisters already have appeared before the grand
jury.
   ``I can't tell you what's happening,'' Gertner said.
``Everything before the grand jury has been impounded. All the
motions that have been filed are impounded.''

   Monday morning could bring on a special case of
the groggy blahs after the switch to daylight saving time this
weekend, but some quick action can help ease the problem, a
researcher says.
   ``This is one weekend you shouldn't sleep in,'' said Dr. Charles
Czeisler, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Disorders
Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   Instead, the trick is to accustom the body as fast as possible
to the time change, he said Friday.
   The shift, which occurs with the loss of an hour at 2 a.m.
Sunday, delivers a one-two punch to the body. It usually robs an
hour of sleep, since most people have trouble falling asleep an
hour earlier than their normal bedtimes. And it forces the body to
readjust its daily internal rhythms, including one that affects
alertness and performance, Czeisler said.
   One study found that traffic accidents jump 10 percent in the
week following the switch to daylight saving time, he said.
   Sleep expert Merrill Mitler of the Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., said the one-hour change is
generally tolerated well by the body, and adjusted to within a day
or so.
   The body copes more easily with the return to standard time in
the fall, because turning the clock back an hour is less of a
challenge.
   Here is Czeisler's prescription for making Monday morning as
painless as possible:
   _ Don't stay up late tonight.
   _ Get up at your normal time, according to the clock, on Sunday.
   _ After getting up Sunday, take a walk outdoors for a half hour
to 45 minutes before breakfast. The idea is to expose yourself to
bright outdoor light. That will help re-set your body's clock,
which is in your brain.
   _ If you want to make up some sleep lost earlier in the week,
take a nap around 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. today and Sunday.
   _ Don't eat any heavy meals late today or Sunday, because that
will make it harder to fall asleep. Similarly, avoid caffeine after
6 p.m.

<HEAD>Nevada Hit With Worst Cricket Infestation Since '30s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Millions of crop-eating, leaf-chomping
crickets that can grow as big as a small mouse have invaded rural
Nevada in the worst infestation of the insects since the 1930s,
agricultural officials said.
   ``We've probably got 700,000 acres of the state infested now;
They're starting to hatch and the ground is just black with them in
some places,'' Dick Rowe, deputy director of the plant industry
division of the Nevada Agriculture Department, said Friday.
   ``Right now they're little devils, but pretty soon if they're
not stopped they're going to be big mothers.''
   Rowe has counted about 100 Mormon crickets per square foot in
the worst infested areas, compared with one or two in a normal year.
   The insects got their name from a similar infestation reported
in Utah in the 1800s. Sea gulls from Salt Lake City reportedly flew
over the infested land, eating the crickets to save the
Mormon-populated area from total destruction, he said.
   ``I don't know if it's true or not,'' he said. ``But it takes a
pretty good size bird to eat them when they're mature. Most of them
are about the size of your thumb and they got hard spurs on the
back of their legs so they get stuck in the craw of birds and kill
them.''
   The crickets, which make chirping sounds, spit brown juice and
bite humans if disturbed, ``eat everything in sight including each
other,'' Rowe said.
   Unable to fly, they march in bands across the land and strip
crops clean, eat leaves and bark off trees and gobble up any
organic material.
   Common crops across the infested parts of Nevada include
alfalfa, alfalfa seed, potatoes, meadow hay and small grain.
   State and federal agriculture agencies are developing a plan for
controlling the infestation in northeastern and north-central
Nevada.
   Chemical spraying and baiting the area with poisoned food is
being considered and a control plan is expected to be adopted next
week, according to Rowe and George Nash, head of the federal Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service plant disease and quarantine
operation based in Reno.
   But Nash estimated it would cost $15 per acre for control
measures with farmers and ranchers paying half the cost on private
lands and the government picking up the entire tab on public
property.
   Rowe said three or four dry springs in a row and recent warm
weather have been perfect for the crickets. The crickets stop in
their tracks when the temperature drops and starve if they don't
continue their hungry march, he said.
   Jeff Knight, also with the state agriculture department, said
the crickets lay eggs in the summer and fall that incubate during
the winter and hatch in the spring. The one-generation insects
normally live through September, he said.
   ``It's frightening once they get larger and start moving,''
Knight said. ``I've seen some the size of a house mouse, about 2
inches in body length and three-quarters of an inch wide. When they
bite they're big enough to break the skin.''

<HEAD>Justices Put Flag Burning Case on Fast Track</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protecting the American flag and the rights of
political dissenters could be hot election issues this fall in view
of the Supreme Court's willingness to swiftly confront the
flag-burning controversy.
   The justices announced Friday they will decide by early summer
whether Congress violated free-speech rights when it passed a law
last year making it a crime to burn the flag.
   If the justices agree with two federal judges and strike down
the statute, President Bush and Republican leaders will push to
amend the Constitution and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
says he will not stand in their way.
   Foley has said that within 30 days of a high-court ruling
invalidating the federal law, the House would vote on a
constitutional amendment.
   Such an amendment would say a ban on flag burning does not
violate free speech. It would require approval by two-thirds of the
members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38 state
legislatures for inclusion in the Constitution.
   The Supreme Court on Friday granted an administration request to
put the flag-burning issue on a fast track that will allow it to
announce a decision by July in cases from the District of Columbia
and Seattle. Federal judges struck down the law in both cases.
   The justices said they will hear arguments in the cases May 14,
marking the first time in nine years that a hearing will be
conducted that late in a court term. The court heard arguments June
24, 1981, when it studied the legality of the agreement that ended
the Iran hostage crisis.
   On only two other occasions in recent times has the court held
such special sessions _ before allowing publication in 1971 of the
Pentagon papers on the war in Vietnam and before ordering
then-President Nixon in 1974 to surrender Watergate-scandal tape
recordings.
   Arthur Kropp, president of the civil liberties group People for
the American Way, decried the court's timing.
   ``Depending on the outcome, we can expect that last year's
favorite political football, a constitutional amendment, will be
back to kick off a whole new generation of 30-second attack ads,''
Kropp said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., hailed the court action.
   ``Flag burners have been having a field day at Old Glory's
expense,'' he said. ``The court's decision to put this issue on a
fast track is great news for the flag, the American people and
those of us in Congress who want Old Glory to have the protection
it deserves.''
   The justices, voting 5-4 last June, struck down a Texas law
barring desecration or destruction of the flag. The court said
burning the American flag as a form of political protest is
protected by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.
   The ruling touched off a political firestorm and led to
enactment of the federal law, which carries a maximum one-year jail
sentence.
   The Texas law barred flag desecration that seriously offends
others, but the federal law bans flag burning regardless of its
impact on anyone. Democratic leaders in Congress say that
difference makes the federal law constitutional.
   The Justice Department has urged the high court to uphold the
federal law despite the department's misgivings and statements by
Bush that a constitutional amendment to protect the flag is
preferable.
   The president allowed the law to be enacted Oct. 28 without his
signature, saying he doubts it is constitutional.
   David Cole, a lawyer representing protesters who burned flags,
said he was disappointed that the justices will decide the issue
before the fall elections.
   Such speedy review ``is unfortunate, given the importance of the
issue,'' he said.
   The controversy echoes themes from the 1988 presidential
campaign in which Bush stressed patriotic values and attacked his
Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, for
vetoing state legislation to require that public school teachers
lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.

   President Bush says he doesn't expect Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to reply to his confidental message on
Lithuania, but just wanted ``to be sure the Soviets understand our
position'' on the rebellious republic.
   Bush said Friday that he had sent the message to Gorbachev on
the crisis to be ``sure there's no disconnect because of
misinformation.''
   ``Our views on the question of self-determination ... are
well-known around the world, but I do not want to risk
misunderstanding by failing to communicate,'' he told reporters
during a picture-taking session at the White House.
   Later, while playing golf at the Marine Corps base in nearby
Quantico, Va., the president was asked if he had heard anything
back from Gorbachev. ``What I said doesn't, I don't think, require
any answer,'' he replied.
   However, the Soviet president's latest views will no doubt be
relayed to Bush during Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's visit
to Washington next week.
   Bush said that his Thursday night message to Gorbachev _ given
to the Soviet embassy here, which in turn relayed it to Moscow _
was in keeping with his policy of trying to ``stay in close touch
with world leaders.''
   ``I want to be sure the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we're not trying to make things difficult for
Lithuania or the Soviet Union or anybody else,'' he said.
   The president would not say exactly what he told the Soviet
leader, telling reporters: ``If I told you what I told him it
wouldn't be confidential.''
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
issued a strong warning to Gorbachev that contrasted with the
administration's low-key diplomacy.
   If the Soviets use force against Lithuanian citizens, Dole said,
``The Soviets will be in real trouble here _ no trade agreements,
no trade preferences and no more of the kind of relations the
Kremlin is desperately seeking from Washington. It would be a
severe blow to U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United
States was continuing to call for a resolution of the dispute
through dialogue and independence.
   ``We support Lithuanians in their desire to achieve
self-determination. The real issue is how do we best get there,''
Baker said.
   The United States has never recognized the forced incorporation
of Lithuania, or the other Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia,
into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   At the same time, it has not extended formal diplomatic
recognition to Lithuania in the aftermath of Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence, which Moscow considers illegal.
   Over the past week, the administration has strongly warned
against the use of Soviet force to thwart Lithuanian independence
and issued appeals for restraint on both sides.
   Bush's message was his first written contact with Gorbachev
since tensions began escalating with Lithuania's March 11
declaration to secede from the Soviet Union.
   ``I want to be sure that the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we're not trying to make things difficult for
Lithuania or the Soviet Union or anybody else,'' the president said.
   A senior administration official, meantime, said Gorbachev
appears to be under ``considerable domestic pressure'' because of
the Lithuanian crisis.
   ``It isn't in anybody's interest to have this thing blow up,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In a related development, the Pentagon said Friday that Gen.
Carl Vuono, the Army chief of staff, has postponed a week-long trip
to the Soviet Union that was scheduled to begin next week.
   ``It just was felt that it isn't a good time to go,'' said
spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood.
   She said the four-star general had been slated to leave Saturday
for Helsinki, Finland, and travel to Moscow on Monday. Visits to
Kiev and Leningrad were also on the schedule.

   The team, known as the Red Arrows, will perform in Kiev June
23-24 as part of a monthlong British festival and trade fair, the

``It is hoped that it will be followed by further such visits to

<HEAD>Kentucky School Bill Turns State Into Laboratory of Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky, a state hardly type-cast as a hotbed of school reform,
suddenly finds itself in the forefront of national educational
change, thrust into that unaccustomed role by a sweeping court
order.
   Last June, the state Supreme Court declared Kentucky's system of
public schooling inequitable and unconstitutional. It ordered the
legislature to come up with an entirely new system of school
governance and finance.
   On Thursday, the legislature passed a 900-page bill aimed at
smoothing out the inequities between rich and poor local school
districts through a $1.26 billion package of state tax increases.
Gov. Wallace Wilkinson is expected to sign the measure, perhaps
today.
   The result: The state will establish a minimum spending level of
$2,900 for each of Kentucky's 570,000 students. Under the current
system, spending varies from $1,800 to $4,200 a year per student,
depending on each district's wealth or poverty.
   ``We're going to do innovative things in Kentucky for once,''
said state Rep. Greg Stumbo, the Democratic majority floor leader.
``We're not going to be a follower any more. We're going to be a
leader.''
   While undoubtedly important to Kentuckians, the school finance
changes mandated by the bill are not what is most eye-catching to
those concerned with national school reform. Kentucky, after all,
is just one of 11 states where courts in recent years have ordered
overhauls of inequitable school finance systems. (The other states:
New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington,
West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.)
   What's really radical is how Kentucky's new system will change
the state's relationships with local districts _ and eventually,
perhaps, those in other states as well.
   ``Other (reform) attempts started in the nation have only dealt
with funding. None have been as massive as Kentucky's was and none
have been as influential as Kentucky's will be,'' predicted David
Allen, president of the the Kentucky Education Association, the
state's largest teacher group.
   Under the new system, the state Department of Education would
set broad goals that all local districts would have to fulfill.
   Those would include development of critical thinking skills, the
ability to apply concepts from math, the sciences, the arts,
humanities and social studies, and ensuring that students become
sufficient and responsible members of a family, work group or
community.
   Districts, in turn, would gain unprecedented control over
curriculum and other day-to-day operations. And the state would
require at least one school per district to adopt ``site-based
management.'' Those schools would form committees consisting of the
principal and teacher and parent representatives empowered to make
decisions on curriculum and other matters.
   ``The legacy of this act will be how it changes local and state
relationships,'' said Kent McGuire, a school finance expert for the
Education Commission of the States based in Denver.
   To ensure that local districts were meeting Kentucky's education
goals, the state would manage a system of rewards including cash
for improving schools, and punishments for failing ones _ including
shutting down bad schools and firing teachers.
   The idea of giving schools and local districts more power to
govern themselves as long as they meet state-set goals is very much
in line with what leading reformers have been urging lately.
   But Kentucky's plan still leaves unsolved a great unanswered
question educators everywhere are grappling with: how to fairly
measure student and school progress.
   Details are still being worked out, but the bill would have the
state measure school improvement using, among other things,
attendance and dropout rates, and student test scores.
   Some worry that Kentucky could rely too heavily on standardized
test scores for rewarding or punishing schools. That, they say,
would lead teachers to ``teach to the test.''
   ``It would be unfortunate if the system of state rewards and
punishments were to turn solely on performance on standardized
multiple choice examinations, because that would, in my opinion,
pervert the educational process,'' said Arthur Wise of the Rand
Corp. in Washington who has written extensively on school finance
issues.
   ``My own research reveals that when you turn the screws on,
teachers will do what is necessary to make sure that their children
and therefore, they, look good,'' said Wise.

<HEAD>Newman: Deli Owner Made No Significant Contribution to Food
Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Newman testified Friday he never
considered giving stock in his food companies to Julius Gold
because the delicatessen owner did not make any meaningful
contributions to help launch the companies.
   ``Mr. Gold had not made a significant contribution in the past,
and there was no indication he would make a significant
contribution in the future,'' Newman said at his trial in
Bridgeport Superior Court.
   Gold is suing Newman and his charity food companies, claiming he
was promised 8 percent of the stock for his assistance in launching
the firms eight years ago. Gold says he made introductions,
attended meetings and performed other services to help form Salad
King Inc. and Newman's Own Inc.
   Newman says Gold's only contribution was selling some of the
dressing in his deli when Salad King was launched in 1982. And
while the actor once considered giving some stock to four friends
who helped the companies, Newman said he held on to the stock to
assure the profits go to charity.
   ``I was always concerned that somebody else could gain control
of the enterprise and exploit it,'' the Academy Award-winning actor
said.
   Newman's Westport-based food companies make salad dressing,
spaghetti sauce, popcorn and lemonade. Newman launched the venture
in 1982 with friend and novelist A.E. Hotchner as a lark to sell
the dressing they had been making in Newman's Westport home.
   Since then, the companies have made $28 million in profits, all
of which have gone to charity. Newman has also used the funds to
found The Hole In The Wall Gang Camp, a camp in Ashford, Conn., for
children with life-threatening diseases.
   Newman's testimony continued Friday under cross-examination by
Gold's attorney, Richard Albrecht, who has tried to show his client
is the only person who contributed to the companies but never got
anything for his efforts.
   Albrecht asked Newman if he got power from donating company
profits to charity.
   ``I don't know if I get power. I get satisfaction out of that,''
Newman said. ``If you're talking about getting Red China into the
United Nations, I don't have that power.''
   ``There are different uses of power,'' he said later under
direct examination by his lawyer, W. Patrick Ryan. ``If you are
fortunate enough to have a company like this, you can either take
that money and stick it in your pocket, or you can go out and give
it to people who are less fortunate _ or with the camp, to children
with life-threatening diseases who may not live past the age of 11
or 12.''
   Newman's testimony over Thursday and Friday lasted more than
three hours. The trial itself should wrap up sometime next week.

   With disclosure of past drug use a possible
complication, President Bush's nominee to regulate the nation's
savings and loans faces a confirmation fight on the Senate floor
next week.
   By an 11-10 vote Friday, T. Timothy Ryan Jr. barely won the
endorsement of the Senate Banking Committee to become director of
the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   The drug issue did not arise in the committee meeting. But hours
later, after an NBC News report, the administration confirmed that
the 44-year-old attorney told FBI background investigators that he
used marijuana and cocaine on a few occasions in the early 1970s.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the administration
knew of Ryan's admission and that the Senate committee had voted
``in full knowledge of these same facts.'' He said Ryan still had
the administration's confidence.
   NBC said some senators were privately troubled by Ryan's past
drug use, although none raised the issue publicly.
   Two Democrats joined the committee's nine Republicans in backing
Ryan. Ten Democrats opposed him, complaining he had no experience
in banking.
   ``Sorting through the aftermath of the savings and loan collapse
will (be) the single most demanding and difficult financial job in
our country. So obviously we want someone of a towering size and
capacity to tackle that assignment,'' said the panel's chairman,
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., who opposed the nomination.
   Nevertheless, Riegle, D-Mich., said he hoped the full Senate
could act swiftly on the nomination _ perhaps on Wednesday, the day
after senators are expected to complete a clean air bill.
   The administration has been under pressure to appoint a thrift
director since March 21, when a federal judge ruled the agency
lacked constitutional authority to seize troubled institutions.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals has delayed the ruling until April 11
and the administration wants a Senate-confirmed thrift director in
office before then.
   Ryan, an attorney who specializes in pension and employee
benefit law, would replace M. Danny Wall, who resigned under fire
for his handling of the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Following the NBC report, Ryan issued a statement saying:
``Prior to my nomination I disclosed both on my FBI form and
verbally to the White House, Treasury and the FBI that early in the
1970s I smoked marijuana on a few occasions and tried cocaine once,
perhaps twice.
   ``I regret this mistake. I do not regret having voluntarily
disclosed this information,'' he said.
   Treasury Secretary Brady said in his own statement, ``The
incidents were limited and a long time ago. We knew about this
issue because the nominee voluntarily disclosed this information.
We believe Mr. Ryan is well qualified and his nomination deserves
the Senate's full support.''
   Democrats said Ryan's inexperience in the S&amp;L field would force
him to rely on guidance from the Treasury Department rather than
exercise independent judgment. They complained he had no opinion on
such basic issues as financial standards for S&amp;Ls and whether the
thrift industry has a future.
   The administration countered by portraying Ryan as an
experienced manager and tough enforcer who as solicitor of the
Labor Department from 1981 to 1983 supervised 600 attorneys and
helped clean up corruption in the Teamsters union's Central States
Pension Fund.
   Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the committee,
conceded that Ryan lacked experience but argued that
conflict-of-interest rules and post-employment restrictions have
grown so tight that the administration had a very difficult time
finding a candidate with more relevant qualifications.
   ``We may reach a point where Mother Teresa is the only person we
can confirm to any position in the federal government,'' Garn said.
   Riegle had predicted Thursday evening that his panel would
reject Ryan, but several members said Brady made impassioned pleas
on the nominee's behalf.
   Democratic Sens. Terry Sanford of North Carolina and Richard
Shelby of Alabama ended up joining Republicans in support of the
nomination.
   Sanford told reporters Ryan was a personal friend whom he knew
through the American Council of Young Political Leaders.
   Shelby, who said he was prepared to vote against Ryan as late as
Thursday night, said Friday that he thought the full Senate should
have a chance to vote, adding, ``The job needs to be filled.''
   In addition to his Labor Department service, Ryan has extensive
political experience. He served in the presidential campaigns of
Richard Nixon in 1972, Gerald Ford in 1976 and George Bush in 1988.
He was a legal counsel to Ronald Reagan's 1980 transition team.

   The government has ordered journalists
to submit for review all reports on fighting between its forces and
rebels in eastern Nimba County.
   State radio said the government gave the order Friday because of
``inaccurate and incorrect'' news reports that created ``fear and
anxiety.'' The reports must be submitted to the Ministry of
Information.
   Anti-government rebels invaded this West African nation from
neighboring Ivory Coast in December. They now have reportedly
pushed out of Nimba County toward the capital, Monrovia, about 120
miles to the southwest.
   Western diplomats say hundreds of people, including many
civilians, have been killed by government troops sent to crush the
uprising.
   More than 150,000 people have fled the fighting, mostly by
crossing into Guinea or Ivory Coast.

<HEAD>U.S. Accuses 35 Countries of Erecting Unfair Trade Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, firing a new salvo in
a stepped-up campaign to reduce America's huge trade deficit, is
accusing 35 nations of erecting unfair barriers that block sales of
U.S. exports.
   A list released Friday focused on countries running large trade
surpluses with the United States, led by Japan, whose $49 billion
surplus accounted for nearly half of the $109 billion trade
imbalance last year.
   The Japanese took up 19 pages in the 214-page report, with the
alleged infractions running the gamut from prohibitions against the
sale of American rice to barriers against U.S.-made semiconductors.
   Other countries with a long list of alleged barriers were
Taiwan, Canada, West Germany, South Korea and China. All have large
trade surpluses with the United States.
   Barriers erected by smaller trading partners were targeted as
well, ranging from soybean taxes in Argentina to restrictive
agricultural quotas in Yugoslavia.
   The 1990 edition of the trade barriers report, prepared by U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills, is the first step in drawing up a
``hit list'' of priority countries the administration will target
for intensive negotiations aimed at getting the offending barriers
eliminated.
   The administration, by law, is required to issue its priority
list by April 30.
   A year ago, 34 nations were cited in the initial trade barriers
report. From that list, three countries _ Japan, Brazil and India _
ended up on the priority list as targets for possible retaliation.
   While officials are hopeful that negotiations with Japan and
Brazil will succeed in eliminating barriers, talks so far with
India have made no progress.
   In the case of Japan, negotiators are working against a June 16
deadline for opening markets to U.S. exports of space satellites,
supercomputers and wood products.
   Negotiators announced a breakthrough a week ago in the
supercomputer talks and worked through the day Friday seeking
agreement in the area of satellite sales.
   However, members of Congress said even if Japan does make
progress in the areas targeted last year, other Japanese barriers
should be cited this year.
   ``Until the long list of barriers that U.S. business faces in
Japan is cut down substantially, the United States must keep up the
pressure on Japan to open its market,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee.
   Joshua Bolten, general counsel in the trade representative's
office, refused to speculate on what countries might be put on this
year's priority list. However, other officials said they expected
the administration to again significantly pare down the number of
countries picked for intensive negotiations.
   The requirement for a target list of countries, known as the
``Super 301'' provision, was the most controversial and feared
section of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act.
   All of the countries named Friday for their trade barriers had
been included in last year's initial assessment as well, with the
exception of Israel.
   Israel was cited this year for, among other things, restrictive
licensing practices used to keep American goods out of the country.
   The countries included in the new report are: Argentina,
Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, West
Germany, Finland, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and
Yugoslavia.
   Two trading blocs were also cited: the 12-nation European
Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
   In addition to the talks on specific barriers to trade, the
United States and Japan are conducting separate negotiations to
address economic shortcomings in both nations that contribute to
the trade imbalance.
   Those talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative,
will resume in Washington on Monday.
   The Japanese are pushing for stronger efforts on the part of the
United States to reduce its budget deficit and restrain consumer
spending. American negotiators want an end to various exclusionary
business practices that favor Japanese companies at the expense of
foreign competitors.

   British officials have accepted a 17th century
Dutch painting to satisfy tax liabilities of $4.5 million, Arts
Minister Richard Luce says.
   The Jan Van der Heyden landscape, ``View of the Westerkerk,''
will be exhibited at the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square in
London, Luce said Friday.
   British news reports said the agreement involved the $152
million estate of Dorothy de Rothschild, who died in December 1988
at the age of 93. She was the head of the Rothschild charities in
Israel.
   The Westerkerk is the church in Amsterdam, where the painter
Rembrandt is buried. The painting hung in the church's meeting room
for 200 years until the Rothschild family purchased it in the late
1800s.
   ``It was Mrs. de Rothschild's express wish that the picture
should come to the National Gallery,'' said a spokeswoman at the
museum.
   Luce said another work, ``Richmond Near London,'' painted by
Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot in 1862, was accepted in lieu
of tax liabilities of $593,000 on Mrs. de Rothschild's estate. No
decision has been made about where that painting will hang, Luce
said.

   A school crossing guard who allegedly
shot twice at a student was charged with attempted murder and
ordered to undergo psychiatric tests, police said. The student was
unharmed.
   James F. Murphy, 40, shot at Clinton Drake III, 14, from about
six feet away on Friday but missed, then fired again but his
.25-caliber semiautomatic pistol jammed, police said.
   ``He was laughing and shaking,'' Drake said. ``He was laughing
like he was happy. I was thinking, `Is he going to kill me or is he
fooling with me?
   ``Then he pointed the gun at my chest and fired and missed,''
Drake said. ``I saw the smoke and the shell pop out the side. Then
he pulled the trigger again.''
   Police said they recovered a pistol and 50 rounds of ammunition
when they arrested Murphy in a convenience store parking lot
shortly after the incident.
   Police Chief Michael Chitwood said police were investigating a
possible racial motive. Drake, a student in the Portland
Rehabilitation Education Program, is black. Murphy is white.
   Drake said that on Thursday, Murphy yelled a racial insult at
him. When Drake met Murphy again Friday, Drake told him to avoid
racial slurs.
   Murphy was arraigned in Superior Court on an attempted murder
charge and ordered held in jail pending psychiatric evaluation.

<TEXT>
   U.S. representatives have met with mid-level
Soviet officials four times in a so-far unsuccessful effort to get
the Kremlin's help in repealing a 1975 United Nations resolution
that equates racism and Zionism, a State Department official says.
   ``Several discussions that we have held with the Soviets at the
U.N., in Moscow and here in Washington on the issue of `Zionism is
racism' unfortunately have failed to produce agreement for a
concerted approach toward repealing the resolution,'' John R.
Bolton, assistant secretary of state for international organization
affairs, said Friday.
   Bolton said the dialogue would continue, adding that ``the
Soviets have assured us that the resolution represents a concept
that is no longer acceptable, according to the new political
thinking in the Soviet Union.''
   He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, which is considering a joint
resolution calling on all the U.N. member countries to repeal
General Assembly Resolution 3379.
   Zionism, the movement to re-establish and support a Jewish
national state in the biblical homeland of Israel, is opposed by
Israel's Arab neighbors and their allies.
   Meanwhile, the United States is talking with U.N. member
nations, and would like to take action on the issue when the
General Assembly reconvenes in the fall, Bolton said. However, he
said, it won't take the matter to the floor unless repeal is
assured.
   The United States has been consulting with countries that
originally voted for Resolution 3379 ``but which have subsequently
acquired new governments and new thinking,'' Bolton told the
subcommittee.
   ``Once again, our consultations are far from over, but we have
seen substantial evidence of shifts of opinion,'' he said, citing
indications from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Mexico.
   The United States is also talking with countries that abstained
or were absent for the 1975 vote or which joined the United Nations
later, Bolton said.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., the subcommittee chairman,
asked Bolton to produce a list of those countries that voted for
Resolution 3379 and which also receive direct U.S. aid.
   ``Have we ever told one country _ just one country _ that you're
getting American money but you're not going to get any more unless
you change your mind?'' Moynihan asked.
   Bolton said he did not know.
   Meanwhile, a resolution reaffirming the U.S. Congress' support
for a unified Jerusalem unanimously passed the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on Friday. That resolution, introduced by Rep.
Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., follows recent remarks by President Bush that
the United States opposes new settlements of Soviet Jews in East
Jerusalem.

   ``Predator II'' movie director Stephen
Hopkins says he's sorry for yanking an earplug from musician-actor
Ruben Blades and ordering him back to work during a live television
interview.
   Startled ``Good Morning America'' host Joan Lunden said the
incident Thursday morning was the first time an interview had ended
so rudely in her 10 years on the show.
   Lunden was interviewing Blades when Hopkins walked onto the set
and told an embarrassed Blades it was time to begin shooting.
Hopkins stood in front of the ABC-TV camera and ordered Blades back
to the set.
   Hopkins and Blades came back on ``Good Morning America'' on
Friday, and Hopkins apologized.
   ``This is the face behind the monster,'' Hopkins said. ``I was
waiting for him and waiting for him until I went out to get him.
Sometimes I get a bit carried away.
   ``Unfortunately, I interrupted your interview and I apologize
for that. And I kind of humiliated Ruben, too, on national
television, which is kind of a dumb thing to do.''
   Blades said he was asked later why he didn't slap the director.
   ``Why would I have made a situation which was already awkward
more difficult?'' said the salsa music star. ``I'm a musician for
15 years. I've played through riots and everything you can imagine.
   ``I figured let someone be professional here.''

   Former President Carter said he is unsure whether
he has done more in his recent humanitarian activities than he did
while in the White House.
   But he is sure of this: ``I will never run for office again
under any circumstances.''
   Carter told the Atlanta Press Club on Friday that as a private
citizen he can do things he could not do as president, such as
meeting with revolutionary leaders. As representative of the United
States he would be barred from talking to forces trying to oust an
established government.
   He cited the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David accord
between Israel and Egypt and normalization of relations with China
as among his top presidential achievements.
   But he also noted his efforts through the Carter Center to rid
Africa of the debilitating Guinea worm, which afflicts 10 million
people a year.
   ``If in 1996 we find that where there were 10 million cases of
Guinea worm there are none, I would say the Guinea worm is more
important,'' he said.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor thinks she has completed her
sentence of 120 community service hours for slapping a cop, but a
judge is skeptical.
   Municipal Judge Charles Rubin on Friday ordered the director of
a homeless shelter for women to produce documents ``describing in
full all of Ms. Gabor's services.''
   The judge's letter was prompted by one from Vera Davis,
executive director of the Low Income Elderly United-Community
Assistance Program. Davis stated Gabor had ``fully'' completed her
service at the shelter.
   But Gabor, in a newspaper report published Monday, said she had
put in only 50 hours at the shelter and would complete the
remainder by sponsoring a June 8 benefit auction for the center.
   Not good enough, said Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox.
   ``I'm going to make her work at the shelter for 120 hours,'' Fox
said. ``The implication to me is that Judge Rubin wanted that,
too.''
   If Davis cannot provide the documentation, Fox said, she may
have to testify under oath.
   Gabor's mouthy outbursts during her cop-slapping trial last year
prompted stern recriminations from the judge. She was convicted on
three criminal counts for her run-in with Beverly Hills policeman
Paul Kramer. He testified that Gabor swore, spit and slapped him
during a routine traffic stop.

   An armed woman who allegedly harassed actress
Sharon Gless for years surrendered peacefully at the star's home
after a seven-hour standoff with police in which she threatened to
kill herself.
   Joni Leigh Penn, 30, was quickly handcuffed and led to a police
car outside Miss Gless' Studio City home Friday after she had put
down a loaded .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, said police Capt.
Dan Watson.
   Ms. Penn, who in the past had threatened to kill the star of
``Cagney and Lacey'' TV series, was taken to the North Hollywood
police station, where Watson said she would be booked for
investigation of armed burglary, a felony.
   ``She surrendered voluntarily. She was tired. She was just kind
of worn down,'' said Watson, who described Ms. Penn as an obsessed
fan of Miss Gless.
   Miss Gless was not home during the incident. ``This has been
going on for several years now, and I think has to be dealt with by
the authorities,'' Miss Gless later said in a statement.
   Watson said Ms. Penn was also a suspect in an attempted burglary
at the Gless home Monday night. Miss Gless obtained a court order
in November 1988 requiring Ms. Penn to keep away from her. It
appeared that until this week Ms. Penn had complied with the order,
Watson said.

<HEAD>Panel Calls for Reducing Federal Judges' Workloads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee created by Congress is ending its
15-month study of the federal courts by recommending major
reductions in the workloads of federal judges.
   In a 203-page report to be sent Monday to President Bush,
Congress and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the panel included
these recommendations:
   _Shift more drug cases from federal to state courts, and give
state court systems the money needed to cope with the increased
number of prosecutions resulting from the shift.
   _Transfer many of the disputes over Social Security benefits
from the courts to administrative procedures and encourage similar
out-of-court resolution of job-bias claims.
   _Create ``an office of judicial impact assessment'' within the
federal court system to advise Congress about proposed laws and to
point out ``drafting defects that might breed unnecessary
litigation.''
   _Repeal mandatory minimum sentencing provisions now in effect
for numerous federal crimes, and have the U.S. Sentencing
Commission redraft guidelines that would not be binding on federal
judges.
   The committee said more federal judges are needed, but not above
the number of new judgeships already requested. It also said that
the federal court workload is at a much more critical level in
appellate, rather than trial, courts.
   The report said Congress and the president should fill judicial
vacancies and approve requested additions quickly. But it added,
``The committee does not regard additional judgeships as a
long-term solution.''
   Discussing the judicial fallout from the Bush administration's
war on drugs, the report said, ``Minor drug cases find their way
into federal court because Congress has provided funds for federal
and not for state prosecutions.
   ``Some of the funds that Congress has approved for drug
enforcement should be used to provide assistance for drug
enforcement at the critical state and local level,'' it added.
   The committee opposed creation of a proposed national appeals
court that would serve as a buffer between the 12 regional federal
appeals courts and the Supreme Court.
   But the report recommended that Congress authorize an unusual
five-year experiment as an alternative. It would allow the Supreme
Court to resolve conflicting rulings among two federal appeals
courts by ordering a third appeals court to tackle the same issue
and render a nationally binding decision.
   The third court's ruling would be final unless the Supreme Court
granted a rehearing.
   The committee's report is a response to what committee members
called ``mounting public and professional concern with the federal
courts' congestion, delay, expense and expansion.''
   The 15-member committee was led by Joseph F. Weis Jr., a federal
appeals court judge from Pittsburgh. It included other judges,
lawyers and law professors.

   Gunfire from the ground hit a military
helicopter on a medical flight Friday, wounding a doctor and
prompting the pilot to make an emergency landing.
   The Vermont Army National Guard helicopter was fired on three
times at about 11:30 a.m. while on a flight from Burlington, Vt.,
to Massena, N.Y., to pick up a patient, said Lt. Lloyd Goodrow, Air
National Guard spokesman.
   The helicopter was flying over the Ganienkeh Mohawk Territory in
the town of Altona when the shots were fired, said state police
Maj. Robert Leu. The Mohawk tribe doesn't recognize federal or
state jurisdiction on the land.
   By late Friday, at least 20 state troopers and an undetermined
number of guards from the New York state Department of Corrections
had set up roadblocks to seal off the four entrances to the Indian
territory, said Trooper Richard Garcia, a state police spokesman.
   He said no vehicles would be allowed to enter or leave the
territory throughout the weekend.
   Bill McDermott, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI
office in Albany, said it was ``too early to say'' who fired the
shots or why.
   Passengers heard bullets punching through the UH-1 chopper and
the pilots landed next to a highway when a warning light indicated
a drop in oil pressure, authorities said.
   ``I didn't hear a gunshot per se, but I heard, obviously,
bullets going through metal,'' said nurse Elma Rickards, who was
sitting next to the man who was injured, Dr. James Van Kirk. ``And
then the doctor that was sitting to my right said, `Oh my gosh, my
arm is numb.' ''
   Rickards, still wearing blood-stained clothes at an evening news
conference at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, said she
immediately began attending to the doctor.
   Van Kirk, 27, a second-year resident, was taken to Champlain
Valley Physicians Hospital an Plattsburgh, in northern New York
state across Lake Champlain from Burlington. He was in stable
condition with wounds in the neck and shoulder, said Bart Hayes,
emergency department manager at the hospital.
   Three bullets apparently struck the helicopter, two penetrating
the fuselage and one hitting the tail rotor, authorities said.
   A crew member spoke of seeing someone on the porch of a house
firing at the craft, Rickards reported.
   Rickards and Van Kirk were being taken to pick up a patient from
Massena Memorial Hospital, 55 miles west of Plattsburgh, Banks
said. Also aboard were three military crew members.
   Wet snow and rain had forced the pilot to abort the mission, and
the helicopter was en route to the Plattsburgh area.

   Estonia has formally declared its intention of
seeking independence from the Soviet Union, but it took a more
conciliatory approach than Lithuania and set no timetable for the
break with Moscow.
   Soviet annexation of independent Estonia in 1940 ``did not end
the existence of the Estonian Republic,'' Estonian lawmakers said
Friday in a resolution. ``The Estonian Republic is still occupied
today.''
   The vote in Estonia's Supreme Soviet was 75-0 with three
abstentions.
   The move put Estonia on the path toward a possible confrontation
with the Kremlin, but not as directly as Lithuania. The Lithuanians
declared outright independence on March 11, and they have been
locked in a tense standoff with the Kremlin since.
   Estonian legislators set no independence date. They agreed to
establish full independence only at the end of an undefined
transition period.
   During the transition, Estonia would work out its own future
government structure and settle differences with Moscow.
   The three Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia have
been under Moscow's control since they were crushed by Soviet
forces 50 years ago on the eve of World War II.
   Like Lithuania and Latvia, Estonia gained independence from the
ruins of the Russian Empire at the end of World War I, but it was
annexed by Josef Stalin in 1940.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Estonia ``proclaimed
the beginning of restoration of the Estonian republic, announcing a
transitional period which will be completed with the formation of
the Estonian republic's constitutional agencies of state power.''
   Independent deputy Mart Laar said the session was broadcast live
on television and radio. He said streets of the capital, Tallinn,
were nearly deserted because everyone was indoors following the
proceedings.
   Laar said in a telephone interview that deputies in the
105-member legislature who represent mainly Russian-speaking
districts boycotted the vote but did not walk out of the hall.
   He did not know how many deputies refrained from voting, but
about a quarter of the Supreme Soviet is made up of Russians,
Ukrainians and other non-Estonians who generally oppose
independence.
   The legislature was elected March 18 in competitive voting that
gave pro-independence forces a strong hand in this small republic
of 1.6 million people on the Gulf of Finland.
   Estonia's Communist Party declared its independence from the
main Soviet Communist Party on Sunday. It said the split would be
formalized in October.
   Laar said many deputies support declaring independence from
Moscow at about the same time. He said the length of the transition
period will be set and new leaders for the republic will be elected
when the Supreme Soviet resumes work Monday.
   Estonia initially took the lead in the Baltic autonomy drive by
declaring its right to veto Soviet laws in November 1988. Since
then, however, it has been overtaken by Lithuania's more radical
approach.
   Estonian activists say they want to organize Estonia's economic
system and government before independence. They also say they must
move slower than Lithuania because they do not have such a large
ethnic majority in Estonia.
   Lithuanians make up 80 percent of their republic, but only 60
percent of Estonia's people are ethnic Estonians.
   Latvia, wedged between Estonia and Lithuania, is only about 50
percent ethnic Latvian. It is moving more slowly than its two
neighbors.

   History and the passage of more than 40
years have finally left Jeno Szebedinzsky, late in his life, a
winner.
   Since the late 1940s, Szebedinszky has been an exile, settling
into an adopted country while stubbornly carrying a torch for his
native Hungary.
   During all those years, first in Pittsburgh and recently in
Indiana, Szebedinszky published a small Hungarian language
newspaper that struggled to preserve Hungarian culture among his
fellow emigrants and battle the authoritarian regime that ruled his
homeland.
   ``I love America. I want to be, and maybe I am, a good
American,'' he said in the basement where he punches the text of
his eight-page paper into a video display terminal.
   ``But my home, my mother home, is Hungary. That lives in our
souls.''
   The sudden collapse of authoritarian regimes across Eastern
Europe surprised Szebedinszky as much as anyone. Now with the Iron
Curtain corroded by acid anger of citizens demanding political and
economic reform, Szebedinszky feels vindicated in his loyalty.
   Through the early 1950s, he dreamed of returning to Hungary to
publish his newspaper. The revolt of 1956 brought a few summer days
of promise before Soviet tanks in the streets of Budapest crushed
the uprising. His hopes of an early end to exile were dashed
   But his vigor and determination as a publisher were not. He
proudly tells of wearing out three linotype machines publishing in
Pittsburgh, being part of an energetic Hungarian-language press
that included some 50 newspapers across the country, many published
daily.
   ``We were working against the communists,'' he said.
   The work has not rewarded his finances. The paper's circulation,
never large, has slipped to about 2,000 readers who pay 85 cents
per copy. An issue may carry less than a half page of paid
advertising.
   ``I am a very bad businessman,'' he admitted.
   And he finds himself among a shrinking corps of Hungarian
stalwarts who have resisted the profits of assimilation into
American culture. Although he still speaks of returning to Hungary,
he acknowledged that many others who once lived as exiles have no
such interest. They live now wholly as Americans, with family and
fortunes firmly rooted in land no longer so new.
   After the death of his wife, Amalia, two years ago, Szebedinszky
gave up his Pittsburgh home and moved to South Bend, where his son,
Janos, works as an executive for a book publishing firm.
   ``I've got nothing anymore,'' he said without a hint of
self-pity. ``Just this,'' he said, waving at his small publishing
setup. ``And this one,'' he said, glancing at Janos.
   ``My job is not hard,'' Szebedinszky said. ``I never work. I
enjoy doing it.''

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Meeting With Salvadoran Gov't, Rebels in Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of El Salvador's
government and its leftist rebels will meet for peace talks
Wednesday with U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. and
Salvadoran officials say.
   The rightist Salvadoran government confirmed the announcement of
the talks, set for Geneva.
   In making the announcement Friday, U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani gave no details concerning representatives, the agenda,
the format or length of the meetings.
   Negotiations between the U.S.-backed conservative government and
rebels broke off in November after a union headquarters was bombed
and the guerrillas launched an offensive in San Salvador, the
capital.
   U.N. officials cited a Central American peace plan, the free
elections in Nicaragua in February and plans to disarm the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels as events that have created a positive
atmosphere for ending the decade-old civil war.
   In Caracas, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez and
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani declared Friday that ``peace
is just around the corner'' in the war, in which more than 71,000
people, mostly civilians, have been killed.
   Cristiani and rebel representatives have met separately with
Perez de Cuellar in the past two weeks.
   In San Salvador, the government expressed ``its hope that,
through the dialogue to be renewed under the auspices of Perez de
Cuellar, the country's pacification, which is the most sincere
desire of the government and people, may be achieved.''
   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval told a news conference:
``It should be clear that the dialogue itself is between the
government and the (rebels), without mediation and without the
intervention of elements foreign to the country's situation.''
   It is the latest peace initiative by Perez de Cueller, a
Peruvian, to bring together two warring sides in a regional
conflict. His other efforts have included Afghanistan, the
Iran-Iraq war and Cyprus.

<TEXT>
   A jury will begin deliberating next week
whether John Poindexter did his best to give Congress the facts in
the Iran-Contra affair or engaged in what the prosecution called
``a rampage of destruction'' to cover up the scandal.
   In closing arguments Friday that followed three weeks of
testimony, prosecutor Dan Webb ridiculed the defense case and
criticized former President Reagan's bias in favor of his one-time
national security adviser.
   Poindexter destroyed a presidential document because it would
have exposed his alleged lies to Congress, said Webb. In November
1986, he said, the document was the one piece of paper that ``puts
the lie'' to Reagan's assertion then that there had been no trade
of weapons to Iran for American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``You don't lie to the American public,'' Webb said of Reagan's
speech.
   The presidential document ratified CIA assistance to a Nov. 25,
1985, shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. Poindexter destroyed it
hours after telling Congress the president hadn't approved the
shipment.
   But defense attorney Richard Beckler said the document, known as
a finding, was incomplete and incorrect. ``The only one of those
findings that counted'' was a later one that spelled out U.S.
efforts to make contact with moderate political elements in Iran,
he said.
   Beckler said Poindexter was the first Reagan administration
official to disclose the missile shipment to Congress and did ``his
ever-loving best to give as much information as he could tell'' to
lawmakers.
   This was ``not some grimy little conspiracy'' involving
Poindexter, the lawyer insisted. Poindexter ``was working for the
president of the United States.''
   Webb said Poindexter tore up the finding on Nov. 21, 1986, amid
a ``rampage of destruction'' carried out by his aide, Oliver North,
and North's secretary, Fawn Hall. Poindexter's subordinates
shredded computer messages and altered documents.
   The ``rampage'' was carried out by North and Hall at the
direction of former national security adviser Robert McFarlane,
``but not Admiral Poindexter,'' who didn't know about it, said
Beckler. The alterations hid North's military assistance to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   A day or so before he resigned, Webb said, Poindexter destroyed
5,000 messages in his computer after North called him and said
Attorney General Edwin Meese III had confronted him. North had
admitted the diversion to Meese and Congress was inquiring about
the Iran initiative.
   Beckler said it was routine practice for departing employees of
the National Security Council to delete computer messages.
   Webb said the evidence the defense put on was ``largely
irrelevant,'' with Reagan, who gave a videotaped deposition played
at the trial, being made to recite his contacts with foreign
leaders to help the Contras.
   The prosecutor said the former president was biased in favor of
Poindexter and said he became ``a little bit angry'' when he saw
Reagan wink at his ex-national security adviser on the tape.
   ``I would have expected more of a former president,'' said Webb.
   Webb said North had been generally instructed by Poindexter to
lie to the House intelligence committee by denying he was giving
military advice to the Contras. North testified that Poindexter
sent him to the meeting but said it was his own decision to lie.
   North ``deceived, he obstructed, he did everything he could to
make certain Congress didn't find out what he was doing,'' said
Webb. Poindexter sent North a note five days later saying, ``Well
done.''
   ``He is congratulating him, thanking him for having lied to
Congress,''' said the prosecutor.
   ``He can't send North to Congress to lie, congratulate him when
he gets done lying and escape legal responsibility for what he has
done,'' Webb said of Poindexter.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy and two counts each of
obstructing Congress and making false statements to Congress.
   The jury will receive the case after hearing instructions Monday
from U.S. District Judge Harold Greene.

<HEAD>Cause, Extent of Damage to Libyan Chemical Weapons Plant
Questioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is not ruling out the
possibility that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi may have set fire to
a chemical weapons plant two weeks ago, according to published
reports.
   ``I can't rule that out,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday.
   He said it's possible Libya still may be able to produce
chemical weapons at the plant 60 miles southwest of Tripoli.
   ``Important uncertainties remain regarding both the cause and
extent of the damage at Rabta,'' said Boucher. ``Therefore no
definitive conclusions have been reached.''
   U.S. officials have received intelligence reports indicating
that the fire might have been set by Gadhafi's agents to make it
appear that their chemical weapons program had been put out of
action, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported in
today's editions.
   One report said truckloads of tires were brought to the plant
and ignited on Gadhafi's orders, the newspapers reported.
   Boucher called for the dismantling of Rabta, without regard to
how that was achieved.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, at a meeting of the Association
of American Publishers here Friday, also said the plant was still
there.
   ``It still has, presumably, some residual capabilities. How much
it was damaged, obviously, we don't know yet. That's something that
we'll look at very carefully,'' Cheney said during a
question-and-answer session.
   Before the March 14 fire, U.S. intelligence analysts had
concluded the plant was producing poison gas and nerve gas agents,
as well as canisters to carry the deadly weapons to their targets.
   The day after the blaze, the White House and State Department
said the plant appeared to be out of operation.
   ``We don't know the origins of the fire,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We don't know if it was
sabotage. ... Somebody could have knocked over a kerosene lamp or
something.''
   Gadhafi blamed the fire on West Germany, while the Libyan news
agency, reporting two deaths in the blaze, suggested a U.S.-Israeli
plot.
   U.S. officials declined to say whether the new assessment
reflected a closer look at the facility, presumably by satellites,
or whether Libya, with or without outside assistance, was able to
manage some reconstruction.
   ``The U.S. government is reviewing all available evidence,''
Boucher said. ``Important uncertainties remain regarding both the
cause and the extent of damage at Rabta. Therefore no definitive
conclusions have been reached.''
   He then added dramatically: ``The possibility remains that Libya
can still produce chemical warfare agents.''
   About two dozen countries, including the United States and the
Soviet Union, are known to have the capability to produce chemical
weapons. None causes more concern to the U.S. government than Libya.
   Gadhafi has been accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks against
U.S. and Israeli citizens and facilities. In retaliation, the
United States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986.
   However, President Bush and other U.S. officials denied any
involvement in the Rabta fire, which occurred a week after the
White House called for ``vigorous efforts'' to halt operations at
the plant.
   CIA Director William Webster once described the plant as the
world's largest chemical weapons factory. Gadhafi, however, has
contended it produced pharmaceuticals.

<HEAD>Pentagon Drops Reviews of Export Items With `Minimal Security
Risk'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says it is dropping its export
license review process for certain items deemed to have ``minimal
security risk'' that may be headed to the Soviet Union or Eastern
Europe.
   The reviews involve certain types of computers, medical
equipment such as CAT scanners and equipment for cancer treatments,
and other industrial items such as machine tools and
telecommunications equipment, the Defense Department said in a
statement Friday.
   The Pentagon said it was delegating its review authority in
these areas to the Commerce Department.
   The change in procedure will not remove requirements for export
licenses for the items, but shifts the review process to the
Commerce Department, said an official familiar with the decision.
   That means the Commerce Department may issue the export licences
without referring the export application to the Defense Department
for review. The Pentagon has suggested that the change be
implemented immediately, the statement said.
   The reviews are required for export items considered
``dual-use,'' meaning they could have both civilian and military
applications.
   The move ``is based on our experience with items that we have
approved after going through the review process,'' said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It eliminates
bureaucracy.''
   The Pentagon will continue to review licenses for items
considered to have higher security applications, such as
supercomputers.
   It will no longer review the export license requests for such
computers as the IBM 3031, 4331 and 4341 series, considered on the
low end of mainframe computer systems.
   However, export licenses for such computers as IBM's 4381 and
4370 series will continue to be reviewed by the Pentagon because
they are on the higher end of mid-range computers, officials said.
   The authorization has also been shifted to Commerce for review
of licenses for the temporary export of products that might be
shown at exhibits and trade shows in Eastern Europe or the Soviet
Union, the statement said.
   The change ``is intended to assist our exporting community and
improve the competitive position of U.S. industry in international
trade by expediting the licensing process in areas that involve
minimal security risk,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Chernobyl Disaster Victims Go on Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 victims of radiation in the
Chernobyl nuclear accident have started a hunger strike to protest
inadequate medical care, including shortages of drugs and hospital
beds, the Tass news agency says.
   The news agency, quoting a report in the labor daily Trud, said
about 120 people were fasting at the Institute of Medical
Radiology. The institute is in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, 400
miles southwest of Moscow.
   Another 280 radiation victims in nearby Izum threatened to join
the strike if their demands were not met, Tass said. The news
agency did not say when the strike began.
   Two political groups in the Ukraine, the Greens movement and a
group calling itself Chernobyl, plan to picket the republic's
nuclear power stations on the fourth anniversary of the disaster,
according to the Interfax news agency, an affiliate of Radio Moscow.
   On April 26, 1986, a fire and explosion at the Chernobyl plant
near Kiev in the Ukraine killed at least 31 people. Radioactive
contamination affected millions of acres of land. Nearly 100,000
people were relocated because of the poisoned environment.
   The weekly Moscow News reported in November the death toll had
reached more than 250, including victims who were working at the
plant during the disaster and those who helped in the cleanup.
   A spokesman for the government agency responsible for the
cleanup confirmed the figure of 250 dead but said only the
long-recognized official death toll of 31 could be attributed
directly to the accident.
   In Kiev, the Presidium of the Ukraine Supreme Soviet has
designated April 26 ``Chernobyl Tragedy Day,'' Tass said Friday.
The legislative body earlier this month voted to phase the station
out of operation over the coming years.
   On Thursday, 140 Soviet children who suffered radiation exposure
after the Chernobyl explosion arrived in Havana for medical
treatement and tests. The children, ranging in age from 4 to 15,
were greeted by Cuban President Fidel Castro, the Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina reported Friday.
   Castro pledged to help another 10,000 children who Soviet
doctors estimate were exposed to radiation, the Mexican government
news service Notimex reported.
   Tass said 120 people in Kharkov were on a hunger strike as of
Wednesday. Their demands were not new. They were first presented to
the Congress of People's Deputies at its inaugural session in May
1989, then were sent to the Soviet and Ukrainian governments, trade
unions and health ministries, Tass said.
   A resolution adopted by the regional Trade Unions Council said
radiation victims should be given priority medical treatment, as
well as the necessary drugs and food, the news agency said.
   ``However, organizations in charge of implementing the
resolution have ignored the legitimate interests of Chernobyl
victims, despite receiving a notice of a possible hunger strike as
early as February,'' Tass said.
   It quoted a strike committee member as saying the fast ``will
continue until the protesters receive guarantees from the Soviet
leadership, or until the arrival of a special government
commission.''
   Tass gave no additional details of the conditions in which the
patients were kept, except to cite the shortages of hospital beds
and drugs. Both problems are common in the Soviet Union, where
top-quality health care is hard to find, but the government had
pledged that Chernobyl victims would be given priority.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature in Moscow is due to discuss
benefits for Chernobyl victims April 22, Tass said. It quoted Trud
as urging the Supreme Soviet to move the discussion up because of
the hunger strike.

   An explosion rocked a crowded train station in
the southern Chinese city of Canton, killing five people and
injuring more than 30, newspapers reported today.
   The blast occurred about Friday about 80 feet from the west gate
of the station, which was crowded with people following the arrival
of a train from Shanghai, the newspapers said.
   The reports said the cause of the explosion was unknown. City
and provincial security officials sealed off the area and
immediately launched an investigation.
   Morning newspapers reported three dead, but the afternoon
Chinese-language New Evening Post said the toll had risen to five.
   A policeman was among those killed, the Chinese-language Wen Wei
Po newspaper reported.
   Two residents of the British colony of Hong Kong, about 90 miles
southeast of Canton, sustained slight injuries. Many of those
injured were travelers from Shanghai and the southern province of
Hunan, as well as Canton residents who went to the station to meet
passengers.

<HEAD>AARP to Close Credit Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Association of Retired Persons
says it is closing its 2-year-old credit union because of a lack of
interest from its members.
   AARP, the nation's largest organization for older Americans,
said Friday that all savings would be protected in the phase-out,
which still must be approved by the credit union's 90,000 members.
The credit union's board of directors voted Thursday to recommend
that it be closed by June 30.
   AARP spokesman Bob DeFillippo said the credit union offered its
members three services _ credit cards, certificates of deposits and
savings accounts _ but only the credit card attracted much interest.
   Overall, the credit union had $150 million in assets, he said.
   Under the AARP's plan, Bank One in Columbus, Ohio, will issue an
AARP-sponsored Visa credit card that will be available to all AARP
members. People who now have credit cards from the credit union
will automatically become card holders through Bank One and be able
to continue to use their existing cards, AARP said.
   In addition, members will get a check for the amount in their
savings accounts, and certificates of deposit will be transferred
to Bank One.

   A former Unisys Corp. employee under
investigation in the Pentagon procurement scandal of the 1980s has
pleaded guilty to a felony count of filing a false income tax
return.
   Frederick J. Carville of New Hartford, N.Y., entered the plea in
the Operation Ill Wind case before U.S. District Judge Claude M.
Hilton in Alexandria, Va., on Friday.
   He faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine
of up to $100,000.
   The plea resulted from negotiations between the U.S. attorney's
office and Carville's attorney, said Michael Costello, who heads
the Washington field office of the Defense Department's criminal
investigative service.
   Operation Ill Wind concerned allegations that defense
contractors and consultants bribed Pentagon officials to obtain
inside information that would give them a competitive advantage in
obtaining multimillion dollar contracts.
   The investigation began in the summer of 1986 but was not
revealed until June 1988 when federal agents executed dozens of
search warrants nationwide. Numerous companies and individuals have
pleaded guilty or have been convicted in the probe.
   Carville, a Unisys marketing representative, was responsible for
getting business for the company at the Rome Air Development Center
at Rome, N.Y., a government facility that does electronics
research, primarily for the Air Force.

<HEAD>Ag Says Farmers to Boost Corn Plantings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers say they intend to boost corn
plantings to 74.8 million acres this spring, up 4 percent from last
year and the most since 1986, according to the Agriculture
Department.
   Soybean plantings are expected to drop 2 percent to 59.4 million
acres, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Friday.
   Except for last year, 1990 soybean plantings still would be the
largest since 1986.
   Total wheat plantings for the 1990 harvest, including winter
wheat planted last fall and spring-planted varieties, were forecast
at about 77.6 million acres, up 1 percent from last year.
   According to USDA records, the all-wheat acreage would be the
largest since 79.2 million acres were planted for the 1989 harvest.
   The 1990 winter wheat crop was reported planted on 57.2 million
acres, up 4 percent from a year ago. But durum wheat planted this
spring was indicated at 3.35 million acres, down 12 percent. Other
types of spring wheat were estimated at 17 million acres, down 4
percent from last year.
   Farmers have been encouraged by relatively strong corn and wheat
prices, as well as an easing of acreage requirements under federal
commodity programs. In the case of soybeans, however, record world
oilseed production has reduced prices from last season.
   The 1990 planting figures were based on an annual March survey
of approximately 75,000 farmers to help determine how much land may
be used for crops this year.

<HEAD>Clash in Boat People Detention Center Leaves 1 Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 Vietnamese boat people armed with
homemade weapons clashed today at a detention center, and a
government spokesman said one man was killed and three people
injured.
   It was the second violent incident in as many days in the
crowded camps that house about 55,000 Vietnamese who fled their
Communist homeland by boat for this British colony.
   About 40 boat people at the Whitehead detention center started a
fire in front of a dormitory after some of those inside would not
let them enter, said the government spokesman, Ricky Chan. The
people outside then broke in and fought with Vietnamese living
inside.
   About 100 Vietnamese clashed before security forces brought the
situation under control an hour later.
   One man, about 25, died of head injuries and three other
Vietnamese were taken to a hospital in fair condition, Chan said.
   Thirty-one people were detained after the incident, which
involved boat people from the northern Vietnamese port of Haiphong,
but the cause of the fight was unclear, Ish Bhagat, a top official
managing the detention centers, told local radio.
   On Friday night, about 100 Vietnamese battled at the Shek Kong
detention center, injuring two boat people, who were taken to
hospital in serious condition.
   Many of the boat people face repatriation against their will
under a harsh policy adopted by Hong Kong in 1988. In December, a
first group of 51 Vietnamese were forcibly returned to their
homeland, leading to an increase in tension in the camps.

<HEAD>Tanks of Diesel Fuel Drop into Lake Baikal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A truck carrying 2,900 gallons of diesel fuel over
Siberia's frozen Lake Baikal has sunk through a fissure in the ice
and may pollute the lake that holds one-fifth of the world's fresh
water, Tass reports.
   Leakage from the tanks _ which came to rest 150 feet below the
surface and 350 feet from shore _ has been limited, the official
Soviet news agency said Friday.
   The tanks are ``reliably plugged,'' and ``the small amount of
fuel that has surfaced is being localized and pumped to the
shore,'' the agency said.
   But Larisa Urbakhanova, head of the Irkutsk regional nature
conservancy district, told Tass that the ``consequences of such a
`bomb' are very unpredictable in Baikal.''
   The lake, 2,500 miles east of Moscow and north of the Mongolian
border, is 390 miles long, 50 miles across at its widest, and more
than 4,800 feet deep at points. Scientists estimate it holds
one-fifth of the world's supply of fresh water.
   Tass said the fuel truck moving over Baikal was part of a convoy
carrying fuel supplies to a settlement on the lake's edge, but did
not say exactly where it sank.
   Baikal's ice is thick enough in winter to drive on, but drivers
must watch for cracks, Tass said. Truck drivers who treated the
lake as they would a normal highway were to blame for the accident,
Tass said.
   The two lead trucks in the conovy managed to maneuver their
vehicles around the cracks, but the third plunged through the ice.
The driver escaped, it said.
   Efforts to save Baikal from pollution have been one of the
starting points of the Soviet ecology movement that has sprung up
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   There is little heavy industry near the lake, located far from
the country's industrial center. Paper factories situated nearby
have been told to stop dumping wastes into Baikal.

   Idaho's anti-abortion governor says he
vetoed legislation that would have become the most restrictive
abortion law in the nation because it was flawed by outside forces
meddling in state affairs.
   ``We Idahoans are a fiercely independent group who will call it
as we see it,'' Gov. Cecil Andrus said. ``I have done that.''
   To out-of-state opponents of his Friday veto, he said: ``I would
respectfully suggest you return to your own states and try and do
it there.''
   In the past three weeks, more than 21,000 telephone calls,
letters and petitions have flowed into the governor's office. Calls
from out of state outnumbered those from Idaho residents by 3-to-1.
   The lobbying peaked Thursday at more than 4,100 calls, with a
ratio of 2-to-1 in favor of a veto.
   Anti-abortion groups wanted to use the Idaho measure to
challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's commitment to legalized abortion
as spelled out in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   The Democratic governor, who is running for a record fourth
term, said he was not fazed by threats from abortion rights
advocates of a boycott of Idaho potatoes, the state's No. 1 cash
crop, if the bill became law.
   ``I believe, and I am confident the people of Idaho believe,
that we can make our own judgments on this terribly important issue
without outside pressure and outside influence or threats,'' Andrus
said.
   The veto effectively killed the bill.
   The Legislature adjourned its regular session before Andrus
announced the veto and can only be called back by the governor.
Bill proponents conceded they lacked enough votes to gain a
two-thirds majority needed to override the veto anyway.
   Andrus said the legislation failed to offer a woman and her
family flexibility in the case of rape and incest.
   ``The bill is drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and
without compassion further harm an Idaho woman who may find herself
in the horrible, unthinkable position of confronting a pregnancy
that resulted from rape or incest,'' Andrus said.
   He said legal scholars from both political parties found the
bill did not have the ``remotest chance'' of surviving a court
challenge that could cost the state as much $1.5 million.
   The legislation called for outlawing abortion except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is under 18, severe fetal deformity, or a threat to the life or
physical health of the woman. It was similar to bills rejected by
other states as too restrictive.
   ``When all the rhetoric and emotion is set aside and the issues
are examined in the cold glare of hard cases, these restrictions
fail the test of reasonableness and compassion,'' Andrus said
   His decision was quickly cheered by abortion rights advocates
who had feared his longstanding opposition to abortion except in
cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the women would sway
him to sign the bill.
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said Andrus took a bold step in view of his anti-abortion
philosophy.
   She noted the move might have a political cost for him, adding:
   ``But we will be there to support him and the people of Idaho
will support him because a majority of the people of Idaho
disagreed with what the Legislature did.''
   The National Right to Life Committee, which was instrumental in
drafting the measure, had harsh words for Andrus.
   The organization's president, John Willke, said Andrus had bowed
to ``the hollow threats and pressure tactics of pro-abortion
extremists.''
   Willke called it ridiculous for Andrus ``to continue to claim he
is pro-life when he has vetoed a bill that would have saved
thousands of lives.''
   Andrus acknowledged he faced political fallout from his veto,
especially since the front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination, state Sen. Rachel Gilbert of Boise, voted for the bill.
   Two of the bill's chief architects, Rep. Gary Montgomery and
Sen. Roger Madsen, both Republicans, said they would refine the
bill and reintroduce it in the 1991 session.
   ``There are a tremendous amount of people in Idaho who are
pro-life,'' Madsen said.

   Five Vietnamese officials visited the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial here as a gesture of reconciliation with the
United States.
   They made a privately-sponsored pilgrimage Friday to the stark,
black granite monument bearing the names of more than 58,000 U.S.
war dead. The two nations have yet to normalize relations from the
bitter conflict in the 1960s and 1970s.
   One of the sponsors of the visit told of plans to build a
hospital at the site of the 1968 My Lai massacre, where American
soldiers killed more than 175 unarmed men, women and children in an
incident that led to the court martials of those accused.
   Cherie Clark of Denver, Colo., a former military nurse working
to organize private U.S. relief programs for Vietnam, said she
hopes the U.S. government will grant permission to collect and send
contributions for the facility. The two-story hospital and clinic,
which would have between 15 and 30 beds, would be called ``the
American Hospital,'' she said.
   The Treasury Department has authorized collection of private
funds for medical supplies for 11 orphanages in Vietnam sponsored
by the network of U.S. relief organizations helping the Southeast
Asian country, said Kirby Jones, a spokesman for Friends of
Children of Various Nations, one of the groups.
   Normalization of government relations and lifting of a U.S.
trade embargo against Vietnam have been delayed to await the
withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia, which occurred last
year, and to gain Hanoi's support of a comprehensive peace
settlement in Cambodia.
   Meanwhile, a flow of U.S. Vietnam veterans, including
physicians, have been revisiting the country, many returning with
descriptions of acute shortages and desperate need for medical and
child-care facilities.
   The five Vietnamese arrived in Seattle on March 9 and have
stayed in the homes of support groups in the Pacific Northwest,
California, New Mexico, Colorado, Minnesota and Michigan. After
spending the weekend in Washington and Baltimore, they were
scheduled to visit Boston and New York before returning next Friday
to Vietnam.
   They are Nguyen Van Chi, director of social welfare and war
invalids at Ho Chi Minh City, former Saigon; Tran Thi Hieu Hanh and
Vu Khoc Nhu of the foreign ministry in Hanoi; Tran Thi Thuong,
director of the Mam Non No. 2 orphanage in Thu Duc; and Nguyen Thi
Chau, deputy director of the children's committee of Ho Chi Minh
City.

<HEAD>Report: Flight Engineer Flew After Tested Positive for Cocaine Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines flight engineer
fired this month after being charged with buying crack tested
positive for cocaine use in July but kept flying for the
strike-plagued airline, a company spokeswoman confirmed.
   The spokeswoman said the test results apparently went unnoticed
because of a clerical error.
   Eastern fired Dain Schneemilch, 36, of Key Largo, Fla., on March
20 after he was charged with buying $20 worth of crack from a local
police officer posing as a drug dealer in February.
   In a termination letter, the chief pilot of the airline's Miami
crew base, Michael Vaughan, wrote Schneemilch that his Eastern drug
test last July was positive for cocaine use, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported today.
   That test had been administered after Schneemilch decided to
cross the picket line in the Air Line Pilots Association strike
against Eastern, the newspaper reported. The strike began in March
1989.
   Schneemilch continued to fly as a flight engineer on Boeing 727s
until mid-September, the Star-Telegram reported.
   On Sept. 18, Schneemilch was promoted to first officer, or
co-pilot, on the same aircraft. He was in ground school training
for his new assignment at the time of his arrest in February,
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said.
   ``When he tested positive for cocaine use in July, it should
have been noticed by someone on our staff, but it wasn't,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said. ``It was a clerical error, a mistake.''
   The carrier hired about 1,000 pilots between April and August of
last year, Ms. Ceremsak said, as Eastern tried to rebuild itself
from the pilots' and mechanics' strike. Also, about 700 striking
pilots crossed the picket lines and returned to work during that
time.
   ``We believe that's probably why it happened at that time,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said. ``That's not meant as an excuse, just an
explanation.''
   She said Schneemilch never served as a first officer on any
Eastern flight. She also said Schneemilch had passed a drug test
administered as part of his annual physical exam only four days
before the arrest.
   Since Schneemilch's arrest, Eastern has reviewed the drug tests
of all of the pilots it hired last summer and found no other
positive results were overlooked, Ms. Ceremsak said.
   The drug test he took last summer was not then required by the
Federal Aviation Administration, she said. Random drug tests of
airline employees began in December.
   Schneemilch has pleaded innocent to the crack-buying charge. The
case is pending in Florida state court. His attorney, Timothy
Thomes of Key Largo, told the Star-Telegram: ``While matters are
pending, we would have no comment.''

<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing 87 people by setting
an illegal social club ablaze in a spurned lover's rage was
indicted on 174 counts of murder.
   A state grand jury Friday indicted Julio Gonzalez, 36, on one
count of second-degree murder and one count of murder in the
commission of a felony for each person killed inside the Happy Land
Social Club on Sunday.
   He also was indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of
attempted murder and assault.
   Gonzalez was not present when the indictment was returned. He is
being held under a 24-hour watch at Bellevue Hospital, where no
other prisoners are permitted within 20 feet of him. He is due back
in court April 12.
   The Red Cross was preparing a charter flight to carry more than
40 bodies back to Honduras today. Six victims were buried Friday.
   Gonzalez's court-appointed defense attorney, Richard W. Berne,
told reporters at state Supreme Court in the New York City borough
of the Bronx he would consider an insanity defense.
   That angered Violet Sambula, a friend of victim Gladys Gomez, 26.
   ``He's going to try to get away with it. It's just not fair,''
Sambula said at a wake for three victims Friday night.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez conceivably
could be convicted of two murder counts for each victim, but he
said a jury ``probably would have to choose between the two.''
   Gonzalez' sentence could face 25 years to life in prison if
convicted on all counts and if the sentences run concurrently,
Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner said. If a judge made the
sentences run consecutively, he could receive a 2,000-year term.
   ``No case is open and shut,'' Warner said. ``We have a very good
case. The evidence is strong.''
   While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities
released records indicating the social club's landlord was
contacted by a fire lieutenant about eight months ago and told a
vacate order was in effect against the building.
   Morris Jaffe, a partner in Little Peach Realty Corp., responded
that the problem ``would be taken care of,'' according to a July
28, 1989, Fire Department document. Jaffe and Jay Weiss, husband of
actress Kathleen Turner, are partners in the realty company.
   Jaffe was not in his office Friday morning to comment on the
report.
   Also on Friday, two more multimillion-dollar negligence lawsuits
were brought by families of fire victims against the social club;
Alex DiLorenzo, identified as the building's owner; Little Peach;
Weiss and Jaffe, and the City of New York.
   One lawsuit is seeking $100 million, the other $57 million.
   In addition to negligence, the lawsuits, filed in Manhattan's
federal court, charge the city with ``an official policy of
deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights'' of the
deceased.

<HEAD>Mechanical Failure, Bad Weather Blamed for Andes Copter Crash</HEAD>

   Bad weather and mechanical failure are
suspected in the crash of a U.S. anti-drug helicopter in the Andes
that injured the three Americans and two Peruvian policemen on
board, the U.S. Embassy says.
   Leftist rebels and drug traffickers are active in the area in
eastern Peru but were not believed to have been involved in
Friday's crash of the Un-1 Huey helicopter, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The helicopter went down while flying with two others from Tingo
Maria, 200 miles northeast of Lima to Mazamari, 175 miles east of
Lima, and came to rest 12,000 feet up a mountain, the spokesman
said.
   No reason was given for the crash, but the spokesman said
without elaboration that bad weather and mechanical failure were
suspected.
   Peruvian police have bases in Tingo Maria and Mazamari that are
involved in the anti-narcotics program, supported by the U.S.
government.
   The Americans worked for National Air Transport Inc., which has
a State Department contract to provide support to Peruvian police
and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Peru.
   The names of the injured could not be released for security
reasons, he said. The five were evacuated to a hospital in Tingo
Maria, he said.
   The Embassy spokesman said the Americans _ a pilot, medic and
mechanic _ suffered ``injuries and fractures,'' but said he did not
know the seriousness of the injuries.
   The spokesman said a Peruvian police gunner riding in the
helicopter appeared to be the most seriously injured.
   Ten Huey helicopters are on loan from the State Department. They
are used by anti-drug agents and Peruvian police in raids on coca
fields, processing laboratories and clandestine airstrips in Peru's
Upper Huallaga Valley.
   The helicopters are piloted by contracted American civilians and
Peruvian co-pilots. They operate out of the U.S.-built base at
Santa Lucia, 250 miles northeast of Lima.
   Twenty to 40 U.S. drug agents are stationed at Santa Lucia to
assist police.
   The base at Mazamari is a training camp where U.S. Green Berets
instruct Peruvian police in jungle warfare. The Embassy says about
12 Green Berets are stationed at Mazamari.
   The Embassy spokesman would not comment on the purpose of
Friday's flight.

   Even whales are wary of the
dentist.
   The College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia kicked off
dental health month Friday with an attempted demonstration of
tooth-brushing on Hyak, a 7-ton killer whale at Vancouver Aquarium.
   Photographers gathered at the edge of the aquarium pool as
trainer Doug Pemberton crouched with a 5-foot-long red toothbrush
and a bucket of herring to get Hyak to open wide for a brushing.
   Hyak approached for a snack, took one look at the toothbrush and
headed for the other side of the pool with a spurt from his blow
hole.
   The black and white whale isn't shy about performing in regular
shows, aquarium spokesman Stefani Hewlett said. But at age 24, Hyak
is set in his ways.
   ``He's a very experienced animal in everything else, but the
toothbrush is something new and he is highly suspicious of it,
obviously, and he's giving it a very wide berth,'' Hewlett said.
   The responsibilities of dental health month fell to another of
the aquarium's three orcas, 12-year-old Finna, after Hyak fizzled.
   Finna opened wide for a tooth brushing after a treat of herring.

   The Medellin cocaine cartel will give
its death squads $100,000 for each anti-narcotics police officer
they kill and $4,000 for every other policeman slain in Bogota and
Medellin, police have said.
   Cartel leader Pablo Escobar also sent grenades and assault
rifles to Bogota, the capital, to renew its terrorist offensive
against the government, said spokeswoman Cpl. Elsie Patino of the
judicial police.
   The judicial police, the Peruvian equivalent of the FBI,
discovered the cartel's plans for assassinating police through
intercepted communications, Patino said.
   Escobar was heard ordering new attacks in retaliation for the
government's renewed anti-drug offensive, she said.
   On Wednesday, after a two-month lull, the administration of
President Virgilio Barco renewed extraditions of drug suspects to
the United States. Fernando Gutierrez, 29, was sent to Phoenix to
face drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   He was the 15th Colombian extradited since August, and police
are holding 17 more Colombians wanted by the United States.
   The government intensified its war against traffickers in August
after drug runners killed a leading presidential candidate.
Traffickers retaliated by killing more than 200 people in separate
attacks.
   After the latest extradition, the cartel hinted in a statement
Thursday it was planning new attacks.
   On Friday, troops pressed the government crackdown by taking
over Envigado, six miles north of Medellin. According to the
military, the town is virtually run by Escobar and is reported to
be his center of operations.
   On Thursday, Barco declared martial law in Envigado. According
to the presidential decree, the town's security forces will be
dismantled.
   The commander of Medellin's army brigade, Gen. Harold Bedoya,
said last month that Escobar controlled Envigado's municipal police
force. Eighteen members of the force were arrested this month, and
nine were formally accused of carrying out killings for Escobar.
   The National Security Council also dismantled a civilian police
force organized by Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez and only
national police were to be allowed to operate in the city of 2
million.
   Also Friday, Norberto Rodriguez, the brother-in law and cousin
of President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, was freed Friday in
Colombia, eight and a half months after being kidnapped from his
northern Colombian farm, government sources in Caracas said.
   Rodriguez, 65, was kidnapped on July 14, from his farm about 25
miles from Cucuta. Rodriguez, once a Venezuelan consul in Cucuta
had retired some years ago.
   Accounts of his kidnapping first said the abductors belonged to
the People's Liberation Army, also known as the ELN, a
Maoist-oriented guerrilla group. Later, the kidnappers were
described as common criminals who asked for a ransom of $240.000.
   Perez said that as a matter of principle, he would not accept
the kidnappers' conditions.

<HEAD>Supermarket Sues Government Over Law Restricting Large Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States today picked up an unexpected
ally _ a Japanese supermarket chain _ in its fight against a law
that hinders large, more efficient stores from competing with
mom-and-pop outlets.
   Life Stores Co. today said it filed a $6.3 million suit against
the government, claiming restrictive government requirements have
held up approval of one new supermarket for nine years.
   ``Our experience is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many
other similar stores who have been facing the same problem,''
Toshiaki Namiki, a company spokesman.
   At issue is the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, a prime target of
U.S. trade pressure. Under the law, local shopkeepers, many fearful
of the competition that a larger and likely lower-priced
supermarket or department store would bring, often can stop a
competitor from moving into their area.
   In a news release, the chain's chairman, Nobutsugu Shimizu, said
it was ``a shame to the country and its people to maintain such a
law.''
   Retailers in Shiki City, 15 miles north of Tokyo, are against
the disputed supermarket because they fear their businesses will be
damaged, said Eiten Sato, a spokesman for the Shiki Chamber of
Commerce.
   Under the law, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
can require large retailers to obtain local approval if their store
is likely to negatively affect local retailers. Without approval,
large retailers cannot open new outlets.
   The store law is a focal point in U.S.-Japanese trade talks,
which are to resume Monday in Washington. The United States says
the law gives undue influence to Japanese manufacturers and
prevents imported products from reaching store shelves.
   In contrast, Japanese retailers such as Mitsukoshi and Tokyu
department stores and Yaohan supermarkets have already opened
stores in the United States.
   In a test of trade barriers, the government agreed Tuesday to
consider a request by U.S. toy retailer Toys R Us Inc. to open a
53,000-square-foot discount store in the country.
   U.S. officials says the loosening of Japan's market could ease a
U.S. trade deficit with Japan that reached $49 billion last year.
   However, the trade and industry minister, Kabun Muto, said
earlier this week that he has no intention of scrapping the law.
   Life Stores, an Osaka-based grocery store chain with 70 branches
nationwide, is also requesting the immediate ban of the law. Store
chairman Shimizu said he might drop the suit if the government
agrees to scrap the law in the trade talks with U.S. officials.
   He said Life Stores' action came shortly before the
U.S.-Japanese meeting because ``we thought it's now or never.''
   ``Victims of the Large-Scale Store Law are none other than the
consumers,'' Shimizu said.

   Greyhound Lines Inc. cited continuing violence
when it canceled a trip to the bargaining table next week in the
monthlong strike by union bus drivers.
   A union leader accused the company of using smear tactics
against the strikers by blaming them for the violence. The company
says there have been 28 shooting attacks on buses, 70 bomb threats
against buses or terminals and more than 100 other incidents since
the strike started.
   The two sides had agreed to meet Monday with federal mediators
in Tucson, Ariz., but the company called off the talks Friday, when
it reported three more shootings and a bomb threat.
   P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president, said
the company would agree to meet April 9 ``if there is no other
violence in the meantime.''
   In a letter to Edward M. Strait, president of the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions, Lannie said: ``We cannot resume
negotiations while the violence continues.''
   Strait said the union has repeatedly condemned violence and
should not be blamed by Greyhound.
   ``Clearly, this is a part of a smear campaign against the union
and the Greyhound employees we represent,'' Strait said.
   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office
and maintenance workers, walked out March 2 in a disagreement over
wages and job security.
   The latest shooting occurred Friday night when a bus was hit
between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pa. Another bus was fired on
Friday near Tulsa, Okla. No one was injured in the incidents,
company officials said.
   On Thursday, a baggage handler in Kansas City, Mo., discovered
three bullet holes in a bus that had traveled from Minneapolis,
said company spokesman George Gravley. There were no injuries, he
said.
   Also Friday, there was a bomb threat at the Chicago terminal. As
in past threats, no bomb was found, the company said.
   Strait said Friday there also have been 60 incidents of
``violence perpetrated by unsafe and ill-trained replacement
drivers against people on the picket lines.''
   Elsewhere Friday, pro-labor rallies were held in about 20 cities
in a show of solidarity with the Greyhound drivers.
   Greyhound has been operating on a reduced schedule since the
strike began, using permanent replacements and crossovers. The
company plans to expand service Sunday, aiming for 54.1 percent of
pre-strike miles covered.

   Police today killed two Moslems,
including a 12-year-old boy, in searches of homes today after
Moslem militants fired on officers patrolling the city center,
witnesses said.
   Elsewhere in the Kashmir Valley, the scene of a bloody Moslem
campaign for secession from mainly Hindu India, border guards
killed three militants near the frontier with Pakistan.
   In Srinagar, the center of the campaign, militants opened fired
at a police patrol, then escaped into alleys. There were no police
casualties.
   Policemen shot and killed the two Moslems in subsequent searches
of nearby homes, witnesses said.
   Roshan Lal, a teacher, said a 12-year-old boy taking private
lessons at his house was dragged from under a bed and shot at
point-blank range.
   Lal said he and other members of his family ran to upper floors
of his house when the firing started. The boy, Nazir Ahmed Sofi,
hid under a bed and was discovered when the troops entered the
house, said Lal, a Hindu.
   Another Moslem, Nissar Ahmed, was killed by police during the
searches, other witnesses said on condition of anonymity. They gave
no details.
   Meanwhile, Press Trust of India said border guards shot and
killed three militants in the Kupwara district Friday. The victims
were among Moslems who tried to slip across the border into
Pakistan to buy weapons, the agency said.
   At least 25 Moslem militants were arrested in the operation,
Press Trust said.
   The killings raise to 238 the number of people killed since the
government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the separatist movement.
   India has long accused Pakistan of supplying weapons and
training the miltants, charges Pakistan routinely denies.
   In Islamabad, Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan said Friday
that Pakistan will not be provoked into another war with India over
Kashmir.
   The Kashmir Valley has been disputed between the two nations
since 1947, when India and Pakistan were born through the division
of the British-ruled subcontinent along religious lines.
   India and Pakistan fought two wars over the valley, which
remains divided by a U.N.-monitored cease-fire line.
   Kashmiri Moslem militants earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan but now say they want independence and the status of a
neutral nation.
   Indian-held territory in the valley and the Hindu-dominated
plains of Jammu to the south form the state of Jammu-Kashmir, the
only Indian province with a Moslem majority.
   Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are 64 percent Moslem.
Nationwide Moslems account for 12 percent of the country's 880
million people, while Hindus make up 82 percent.

<HEAD>Opposition Party Launches Anti-Government Referendum Drive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's largest opposition party
today began a drive to collect 10 million signatures, aiming at
forcing national elections to repudiate the newly bolstered
governing party.
   In January, President Roh Tae-woo's conservative party merged
with two moderate opposition groups, giving Roh's governing group
an overwhelming parliamentary majority.
   The new coalition, the Democratic Liberal Party, excluded the
leftist Party for Peace and Democracy, led by Kim Dae-jung, who has
denounced the merger as ``a de facto coup d'etat.''
   ``We must definitely succeed in the campaign and divulge a dirty
political plot by the ruling group to hold on to power forever,''
Kim said.
   He said opposition legislators should have sought voters'
consent before joining the governing party and the government.
   Even if Kim's campaign succeeds to sign up 10 million of South
Korea's 43 million people, it has no binding force under law. And
the government has already rejected the opposition demand to move
up the next general elections, scheduled for early 1992.
   Kim said his party will also push for nationwide public rallies
to appeal for new elections. The first rally was scheduled for the
western industrial city of Buchon on Sunday, Kim said.
   The new governing party holds about 210 of the 299 seats in the
National Assembly, enough to change the nation's constitution at
will. The unicameral assembly had been controlled by the three
opposition parties, led by Kim's party.
   Founders of the new governing party said they wanted to bring
stability to the country's faction-ridden politics, in which the
three opposition parties had been unable to settle their own feuds
to pass legislation.

<HEAD>Mass Transit System Headed for Shutdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition to a bailout plan threatened to
shut down the public transportation system in New York's
second-largest city after tonight's runs, stranding 120,000 bus and
subway riders.
   The potential shutdown also threatened chaos Monday for more
than 9,700 public school students who use the transit system.
Buffalo school officials said the students would have to find their
own rides.
   Hospitals said they would encourage workers to form car pools
and would look into renting private buses, if necessary.
   The board of Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority voted to
shut down the system because only $89,000 was available for a
system that costs $55 million annually to run.
   Mayor James D. Griffin proposed Friday to divert $9 million in
anticipated Erie County sales-tax revenue to keep the system going.
But county officials rejected the plan.
   County officials earlier turned down utility, property, mortgage
and gasoline taxes as potential sources of transit funds.
   The mayor said the city, which faces a $30 million deficit,
can't afford to give up its share of an expected increase in local
sales-tax collections.
   ``Shutting down affects those people who don't appear to have
any voice,'' Griffin said. ``If we close down this system, shame on
all of us.''
   Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski said the mayor's plan was
not equitable.
   ``He leaves out the part where property and school taxes across
Erie County will have to be raised to make up the difference,''
Gorski said. ``Any tampering with existing revenues means you steal
from one pocket to fill another. It's a shell game.''
   Riders said they were furious at the impending shutdown.
   ``I think that if the NFTA thinks that they can shut down the
rapid transit on April Fool's Day, they're nuts,'' said Robert
Orlando, who rode the subway to Thursday's Buffalo Sabres hockey
game.
   But some suburbanites didn't want to subsidize the system.
   ``I've probably been on a bus twice in 23 years, and I feel bad
for the people who have to rely on them,'' said Gloria Mitchell of
suburban Hamburg. ``But I'd rather see them shut down than pay
higher taxes for something we don't use. They should raise the bus
fares. I don't feel we should pay for them.''
   Meanwhile, the transit agency's executive director, Alfred H.
Savage, accepted a $149,500-a-year post as head of the Chicago
Transit Authority. Savage resigned from the NFTA on Thursday,
saying he was fed up with the county's unwillingness to support
public transit.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Sets Conditions for Release of Hostages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem leader was quoted today
as saying that the kidnappers holding Western hostages in Lebanon
will not release them unless the United States helps free Moslems
imprisoned in Kuwait and Israel.
   ``I don't believe that those who held the hostages for a year or
two or even five years will let them loose free of charge,''
Hussein Mousawi said in an interview broadcast by the Voice of
Islam radio station in east Lebanon's ancient city of Baalbek.
   The interview was quoted today in Beirut's independent An-Nahar
newspaper.
   Mousawi heads the pro-Syrian Islamic Amal wing of Hezbollah, or
the Party of God, Iran's main Shiite ally in Lebanon. He contended
that Hezbollah holds none of the 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon,
including eight Americans.
   ``We are not concerned with the hostage issue. We do not have
any hostage,'' he said. ``The hostages are held by security groups
that maintain their individualities and take no orders from
Hezbollah or Islamic Amal.''
   Hezbollah is widely believed to be the umbrella for various
Shiite hostage-holding factions, despite the party's public
disclaimers.
   Mousawi said the demands made by the kidnappers were
``justified, irrespective of the plight of the hostages.'' He
listed the release of 15 convicted terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait
for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983 and the
release of Arab prisoners in Israeli jails.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the group that holds
American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, has long
demanded freedom for he prisoners in Kuwait.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the Western hoatages. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   Several other hostages have been held almost as long, including
Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American University
of Beirut, who was kidnapped in Lebanon on June 9, 1985.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds
kidnapped U.S. professors Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner, has demanded 400 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners be
freed from Israeli jails.
   Israel has rejected the demand.
   ``The United States and all those concerned with the hostages'
issue should consider the rights of these people and how to return
some of them,'' Mousawi said.
   ``America influences Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Things are
intermingled in the domain of global arrogance but all revolve
within America's sphere of influence,'' he said.
   ``If they want their hostages freed, then they have to make some
moves with the Israelis, the Kuwaitis, the Saudis and the
Maronites. Maronites kidnapped brothers of ours, believers, Iranian
diplomats.
   ``Every usurped right is to be recovered. We are not directly
involved in this problem but this my personal analysis.''
   Three Iranian diplomats and their Lebanese driver were seized by
Maronite Christian militiamen in July 1982. All are believed to be
dead.

   The man who designed clothing for Liza
Minnelli, Jacqueline Kennedy and other glamorous women was
remembered for his style and self-confidence by mourners who
gathered for a memorial service.
   Halston, the fashion designer who once ruled high fashion with
his simple, sophisticated designs, was remembered by about 125
friends and family members Friday, five days after his death from
AIDS-related cancer.
   Robert Frowick recalled his brother's strong sense of identity
and unique talent in fashion.
   ``He was always looking for beauty in his surroundings,''
Frowick said.
   Minnelli and model Berry Berenson were the best known of the
mourners, who filed into the ornate Calvary Presbyterian Church.
   White tulips and lillies of the valley blanketed the altar and
bouquets of flowers adorned the church's entry. Trumpeters from the
San Francisco Opera performed some of the music, which ranged from
Mozart and Bach to ``America the Beautiful'' and a composition by
Halston's sister-in-law, Ann Frowick.
   The service was held two blocks from the hospital where the
57-year-old Halston, whose full name was Roy Halston Frowick, spent
the last four months of his life fighting Kaposi's sarcoma.
   Halston kept it secret that he had tested positive for the HIV
virus that causes AIDS. After he died peacefully in his sleep
Monday, his family announced that he suffered from the deadly
disease.
   They also said he had asked that a shiny jet-black Rolls-Royce
Corniche he bought recently to tour the scenic California coastline
be auctioned, with proceeds going to AIDS research. The car was
parked at the curb outside the church during Friday's service.
   The Rev. James Emerson said a prayer for everyone with AIDS and
cancer, and told mourners, ``May action match words in the world of
the political.''

<HEAD>Police Blockade Mohawk Territory After Helicopter Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTONA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State troopers and corrections officers
today blockaded entrances to the Ganienkeh Mohawk Territory after
gunfire they suspect came from the encampment struck a doctor
aboard a military helicopter on a medical flight.
   The doctor was hospitalized in good condition.
   A Ganienkeh spokesman today denied Friday's shooting originated
from the settlement. State and federal authorities were meeting
with Mohawk representatives this morning to discuss the incident,
Trooper Richard Garcia said.
   The Mohawk tribe doesn't recognize federal or state jurisdiction
on the land.
   Busloads of people travel to the territory, about 150 miles
north of Albany, every Friday evening to play high-stakes bingo,
but the games were canceled Friday night.
   After Mohawks refused to let troopers enter the land to
investigate the shooting, at least 20 troopers and an undetermined
number of corrections officers blockaded the four roads leading to
the territory, Garcia said.
   ``We've turned back everybody,'' said Trooper Fred Curns, who
was at the scene. ``We'll turn back everybody until the powers that
be decide it's safe to let them through.''
   The Vermont Army National Guard helicopter was hit by three
bullets fired from a rifle as it flew about 200 feet above the
Indian territory, Garcia said. The settlement, which police say is
home to about 40 people, is on 700 acres of state-owned parkland in
the town of Altona.
   The aircraft, carrying three military personnel and two
civilians, was on a medical flight from Burlington, Vt., to
Massena, N.Y., to pick up a patient, said Lt. Lloyd Goodrow, Air
National Guard spokesman.
   Dr. James Van Kirk of South Burlington, Vt., was struck in the
right arm, Garcia said. Van Kirk, 27, the chief resident at Medical
Center Hospital, was listed in good condition early today at the
Burlington hospital.
   Two of the bullets penetrated the fuselage and one hit the tail
rotor, authorities said. The helicopter landed safely in a field in
the Mohawk territory.
   ``We believe the shot came off the territory,'' Garcia said.
``We can't determine who fired it without interviewing anyone. They
won't let us interview anyone.''
   Daryl Martin, a spokesman for the Ganienkeh, denied the shots
originated from the settlement.
   ``There is no reason for us to provoke an incident like this. We
feel we've been railroaded into this situation,'' Martin said.
   State and federal law enforcement officers have not been
permitted to enter the territory since it was established in 1979.
   ``We set up our own barricades to protect our people. It was a
natural thing for us to do,'' Martin said early today after Indian
representatives met with state and federal authorities to try to
resolve the issue.
   ``Our law is that no outside law enforcement are allowed. We
feel they're pointing the finger at us,'' Martin said. ``They're
threatening to do whatever they have to.''
   One meeting among state officials, FBI agents and Mohawk
representatives broke down late Friday, but talks resumed early
today, Garcia said.

<HEAD>Hekmatyar Replaced as Foreign Minister in Guerrilla Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firebrand guerrilla leader Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar has been replaced as foreign minister of the Afghan
rebel's government-in- exile, the official news agency of the
resistance said today.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, president of the so-called interim
government, said the post would be filled by Burhanuddin Rabbani,
the Midia News Agency reported.
   Rabbani, the government-in-exile's minister of reconstruction,
is leader of the more moderate Jamiat-i-Islami, the most
politically and militarily organized group in the fractious
seven-party resistance based in Pakistan.
   Rabbani's group is a bitter rival of the Hezb-i-Islami Party
headed by Hekmatyar, and there have been widespread reports of
fierce fighting between the two groups.
   The news agency said Hekmatyar quit as foreign minister last
year.
   ``I had long ago decided to induct professor Rabbani to this
post, but due to certain problems, the decision was implemented
now,'' Mojaddidi told Midia.
   ``The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very important and in view
of this, he (Rabbani) has been appointed as foreign minister,'' the
news agency said.
   Hekmatyar, 42, is known for his outspoken contempt of the West.
   But despite the rhetoric, he has received the bulk of the U.S.
arms sent to the Moslem guerrillas during the nearly 12-year-old
war against the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan.
   He has been accused of killing other guerrillas and innocent
Afghans. He also has been accused of theft, opportunism and
collusion with Communists.
   Following the March 6 coup attempt in Afghanistan, the leaders
of the other six parties quickly criticized Hekmatyar for
publically supporting the mutiny led by Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai, the
former defense minister of Afghanistan who had vigorously opposed
the Kabul government's offers to talk peace.
   Troops loyal to Afghan President Najib eventually crushed the
attempted coup, and Tanai defected to Hekmatyar's guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   Police fired rifles today to disperse
about 5,000 pro-democracy protesters, wounding at least three
people, including a woman watching the demonstration from her
house, witnesses said.
   The crowd had massed in the streets of the Katmandu suburb of
Patan to protest the deaths of two demonstrators in a clash there
Friday in which about 30 policemen and 11 protesters were injured.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said police
also used tear gas and made some arrests during today's protest.
But the witnesses did not know how many people were taken into
custody.
   ``I warned authorities to stop police repression against the
people,'' said Kesar Bahadur Bista, who represents Patan in the
Rashtriya Panchayat, Nepal's partyless legislature.
   Siddhi Lal, a Patan leftist leader, said: ``The fascist
Panchayat system used guns for stopping people's rights. So long as
we don't get it (democracy), we will not forget it and we will
carry the movement ahead.''
   On Friday, the Himalayan kingdom's foreign minister quit over
the crackdown on the movement for the restoration of multiparty
democracy. It was the first indication of discord in the government
over how the crisis is being handled.
   At least 14 people have been killed since Feb. 18, when King
Birendra's government began cracking down on the spiraling
movement. Hundreds of people, including doctors, lawyers, students
and journalists, have been arrested.
   The government says Nepal already has a working democracy and
accuses the agitators of trying to foist their brand of democracy.
   A two-year experiment with a Western-style democracy in Nepal
ended in 1961 when King Mahendra, Birendra's father, dismissed the
government of the now-banned Nepali Congress Party, accusing it of
corruption and mismanagement.
   Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, who resigned as foreign minister on
Friday, said in an interview today that he decided to do so after
Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha refused to heed his call
to hold talks with the agitators.
   ``I advised him not to take any attitude which would further
deteriorate the situation,'' Upadhyaya said. ``But he did not
listen to me ... under such circumstances, I found it immoral to
remain in a Cabinet headed by such a short-sighted person.''
   Upadhyaya, who served as Nepal's permanent representative to the
United Nations from 1972 to 1978, also said he condemned violence
by agitators.
   ``Violence cannot be condoned,'' the 60-year-old politician
said. ``Once the dialogue starts, the violence will fizzle out.''
   The government has shown itself unwilling to hold talks with the
protesters, led by the Nepali Congress and a coalition of left-wing
groups.
   King Birendra, in his only comments on the movement, said
earlier this month that there would be no change in the composition
of the legislature, a key demand of the protesters.
   One-fifth of the non-partisan assembly's 140 members are
selected by the king. The rest are elected, but membership in
political parties and political canvassing are banned.

   Shining Path guerrillas opened fire on
supporters of presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa today at
his campaign headquarters in an Andean mining center, killing one
person and wounding 12, police said.
   The three rebels attacked a crowd in La Oroya that had gathered
at the building for a trip to Huancayo, 60 miles to the southeast,
where Vargas Llosa was to address an afternoon rally.
   The Maoist-inspired Shining Path has launched dozens of attacks
this week in an effort to sabotage the April 8 general elections.
The guerrillas have threatened to kill anyone who votes.
   Vargas Llosa, an acclaimed novelist who heads the center-right
Democratic Front coalition, is considered the front-runner.
   Police said the guerrillas, who escaped after today's 6 a.m.
attack, killed a police guard and that the wounded included the
Democratic Front candidate for a regional assembly, Julio Barrios,
and an unidentified youth leader.
   La Oroya is 60 miles from Lima on the main highway to Huancayo.
   Two people were killed in Huancayo's main square Tuesday when a
car bomb set off by Shining Path rebels exploded shortly before a
campaign rally by socialist presidential candidate Alfonso
Barrantes.
   The Shining Path began fighting Peru's elected governments in
1980. More than 18,000 people have died in the violence, according
to government figures.

   Soldiers and their allied militiamen
killed 112 rebels in fierce fighting in southern Sudan, the
military command reported.
   A statement issued late Friday also said nine soldiers and
militiamen were killed and 32 wounded in the fighting in southern

battles took place.
   In addition to the 112 rebels killed, a ``large number'' were

unit's commander was captured. The militiamen are part of a newly
formed popular defense force made up of civilian volunteers armed
by the government to fight the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   It was impossible to verify the government statement because the
south has been closed to outsiders for years due to the rebellion.
   In a related development, the newspaper Al-Sudan Al-Hadith
quoted a senior military officer as saying that 350 rebels
surrendered to the army last week in the Upper Nile region,
northeast of Bahr el-Ghazal.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army began fighting the government
in 1983.
   The movement, based in the largely Christian and animist South,
demands more regional autonomy from the Moslem-dominated central
government. Animists do not worship a single god but believe
everything in nature has a soul.

   Harry Bridges, a crusty labor movement
legend who organized waterfront unions on the West Coast and led
San Francisco into a general strike in 1934, has died at age 88.
   Bridges died of emphysema at his home Friday.
   Bridges founded the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union in 1934 and was its president until 1977.
   ``He was one of the great figures of the American labor
movement,'' said John Hennings, secretary-treasurer of the
California Labor Federation.
   ``He organized the entire Pacific Coast, not just San Francisco,
against the opposition of the shipowners,'' said Henning. He said
Bridges ``created a lasting institution to carry on, not just a
strike of the moment.''
   Bridges also is credited with helping organize many of the sugar
and pineapple plantation, cannery, and mill workers in Hawaii
during the 1950s.
   Born the son of a prosperous real estate agent on July 28, 1901,
in Melbourne, Australia, Bridges went to sea and in 1920 arrived in
San Francisco. Two years later he became a longshoreman when
conditions on the docks were considered the worst in the nation.
   On July 5, 1934, two dock workers were killed and 100 wounded
when police charged a picket line. The California National Guard
was called out, prompting a general strike 11 days later.
   The strike ended in three days with an agreement on a contract
that established a union-operated rather than employer-run hiring
hall.
   In a 1973 address to longshoremen in San Francisco, Bridges
said: ``Experience has taught that the union worker has one weapon
no one else has, and that is laying down his tools and quitting his
job.''
   Beginning in 1939, the federal government tried to kick Bridges
out of the country for 16 years, charging the union leader was a
Communist and had falsely denied being a party member when he
applied for citizenship. He was once jailed for 20 days as a
Communist conspirator.
   Bridges acknowledged receiving help from Communists in 1934, but
always denied being a member of the Communist Party.
   The U.S. Supreme Court twice reversed orders for his deportation.
   Although Bridges and the ILWU had appeared to have mellowed
since the 1934 general strike, the union exhibited renewed
militancy in the summer and fall of 1971, when a strike shut West
Coast ports for 100 days.

   A conservative federal appeals judge has
blocked a murderer's execution in the California gas chamber,
leaving relatives of the killer's teen-age victims stunned and
disappointed. The state immediately appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   Tuesday's scheduled execution of Robert Alton Harris, which
would have been the state's first in 23 years, was stayed Friday by
Judge John Noonan of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
judge said more study of Harris' mental state may be needed.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp's emergency request to
have the stay lifted was received at the Supreme Court this
morning. It was referred to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, who handles emergency matters from the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
   Harris was convicted of abducting two San Diego boys from a
drive-in restaurant in 1978 and fatally shooting them so he could
use their car in a bank holdup. Both victims, John Mayeski and
Michael Baker, were 16. Their bodies were found on a hillside
several hours after the bank robbery.
   The judge's decision came after the U.S. Supreme Court turned
down four of Harris' previous appeals.
   ``I was devastated. I just couldn't believe it. I was in a state
of shock,'' said Mayeski's mother, Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, after
she heard of the decision. ``After 11 years, he's had every
opportunity to plead his case.
   ``I used to think that the death penalty wasn't the greatest
thing, but after going through this I don't think it's too bad,''
she added. ``I hope no one has to go through all that we have had
to go through.''
   Baker's father, San Diego police detective Steve Baker, arrested
Harris after the bank robbery without knowing that his son lay dead
nearby. The double murder was discovered after the elder Baker
leveled a shotgun at Harris at the home of a friend to arrest him
on the holdup.
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Baker said. ``They've looked at this
case through a microscope for 12 years and can't seem to make a
decision. There's nothing I can do about it but take it as it
comes.''
   Noonan, appointed to the appeals court in 1985 by President
Reagan and known mainly for his opposition to abortion, ordered
that Harris be spared to allow arguments before a three-judge
appeals panel on whether he should get an evidentiary hearing.
   That process usually takes several months.
   Noonan said U.S. District Judge William Enright, who turned down
Harris' last-ditch appeal Wednesday, should have held a
fact-finding hearing on new psychiatric evidence submitted by the
defense.
   That evidence includes reports by psychologists who concluded
that the psychiatric consultants who assisted Harris' trial lawyer
acted incompetently by failing to test for brain damage or other
serious mental disorders.
   Enright had rejected those conclusions without a hearing. He
said the dispute amounted to a mere disagreement among experts,
wasn't the state's fault, and wouldn't have affected the jury's
decision in Harris' 1979 trial.
   ``It is reasonably arguable, and we cannot determine from this
record, whether Harris received competent psychiatric assistance,''
Noonan said after a 50-minute hearing in a packed courtroom.
   ``We're pleased that Judge Noonan listened to our argument ...
and was not stampeded by the wave of public attention generated
here,'' said Michael McCabe, one of Harris' lawyers.
   Van de Kamp said Noonan's ruling ``creates a brand-new legal
right for accused murderers like Robert Harris _ the right to
challenge the competency of psychiatric experts years after the
fact.''
   Gov. George Deukmejian said that ``justice has once again been
indefinitely delayed and denied by a single federal judge.''
   ``It is unbelievable that this judge who reviewed this case for
14 months ... would now at this last hour require further judicial
proceedings,'' the Republican governor said.
   Mayeski's uncle, William Stalder, said Harris has had his day in
court and should be executed.
   ``This stuns me. How many times does this guy have to be turned
down? This just keeps the wound open,'' he said. ``It keeps us
waiting and waiting.''

<HEAD>Official Calls for Patriotism Campaign in Chinese Schools</HEAD>

   China's schools will stress patriotism and the
virtues of socialism in lessons marking the 150th anniversary of a
successful foreign attack on China, a government official said
today.
   Also today, a senior Chinese trade official appealed to the West
to end trade restrictions imposed on China after troops brutally
suppressed June's pro-democracy student demonstrations in Beijing,
killing at least 500 people.
   The vice minister of the State Education Commission, Teng Teng,
said students must be drilled in the principles of socialism as
part of a new patriotism campaign ``so that that they can gradually
realize why China must take the socialist road and why the
Communist Party must lead the way.''
   Last week, Premier Li Peng urged students to study China's
struggle against Britain in the Opium War of 1840-42 ``to heighten
their vigilance against the imperialistic strategy of peaceful
evolution.''
   ``Peaceful evolution'' refers to what China's current hard-line
leaders describe as the West's attempt gradually to convert China
to capitalism.
   The 1840-42 war started when the Qing Dynasty tried to stop
British opium sales in China. Britain easily defeated the Chinese
and in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking forced China to cede Hong Kong
and open five ports to British trade.
   Teng said the lessons, which will be increased in elementary and
middle schools, are necessary so that children will ``recognize the
different channels used by the international hostile forces in
their conspiracy to transform China into a vassal state.''
   Ideological education has been stepped up in Chinese schools and
campuses since the suppression of the student pro-democracy
movement.
   Regarding trade, Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Vice
Minister Li Lanqing criticized the economic sanctions imposed by
the West after China used of force to end the movement.
   He also said that if Washington withdraws China's
most-favored-nation trade status, the two nations' relations will
be seriously damaged.
   China's most-favored-nation status comes up for renewal in June,
and some members of Congress have called for eliminating it because
of China's continued suppression of political dissent.
   Such a move would mean a significant rise in tariffs on Chinese
products and could seriously affect China's exports to the United
States, Beijing's third biggest trading partner after Hong Kong and
Japan.

   By muting its response to the Soviet show of
military force in Lithuania, the West gave President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev proof of its commitment to his survival.
   Nearly three weeks into the Soviet confrontation with the
breakaway republic, however, analysts say no one knows what might
provoke some kind of Western retaliation.
   ``They've let Gorbachev go pretty far,'' Jonathan Isle, director
of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research
center, said in an interview.
   ``But all the nationalities of the Soviet Union now feel they
also can go pretty far because Gorbachev cannot afford to be
transformed overnight from a nice, cuddly figure to a Communist
dictator.''
   The United States and others in the West have urged Gorbachev
not to use force in Lithuania, but on Friday President Bush said he
had assured the Soviet president that ``we're not trying to make
things difficult for Lithuania or the Soviet Union or anybody
else.''
   The Western stance has made many Lithuanians feel betrayed and
has angered Western minorities like Welsh nationalists and Basques
in Spain, who thrilled to the Baltic republic's declaration of
independence March 11.
   ``The West keeps saying it never recognized the incorporation of
Lithuania and the other Baltic republics into the Soviet Union'' in
1940, ``but we want some practical manifestations of support and
we're very, very disappointed,'' said Alun Thomas, spokesman for
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party.
   To some critics, the cautious Western response evoked echoes of
1956 and 1968, when a very different Kremlin crushed an
anti-Stalinist uprising in Hungary and liberal reforms in
Czechoslovakia.
   A remark by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reflected the sense
of guilt about not helping Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   ``We still feel unease that the Western world watched as the
Prague Spring of 1968 was crushed by Soviet tanks,'' she told
President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia when he visited London on
March 21.
   Nonetheless, she saw no point, and considerable harm, in the
West getting tough over Lithuania.
   She appealed for restraint in a 50-minute telephone conversation
with Gorbachev a week after meeting Havel, but government sources
said she made no demands and trusted him to honor pledges that
troops would not open fire and there would be no Prague-style
military crackdown.
   ``She always felt that if he said he would do something, then he
would carry it out,'' a senior British official said, on condition
of anonymity. He summed up the government attitude by saying of
Gorbachev: ``He's riding a lot of tigers at once. Don't put
intolerable pressure on the man.''
   The New Statesman, a left-leaning weekly, said the apology to
Czechoslovakia should be matched by a forthright statement of
support for Lithuania.
   ``Gorbachev is still the man that Bush, Thatcher and the rest
want to do business with, the man who can assure a stable and
conservative European order ... yet this is the point between the
rock and the hard place, when anyone who believes in democracy must
speak out,'' it said in an editorial.
   From the right, the weekly Economist said using military force
in Lithuania would be ``the beginning of the end'' for perestroika.
   ``Some people will argue that Mr. Gorbachev is embarked on too
vital a reform to be subjected to sanctions if he crushes
Lithuania,'' it commented. ``But if that is the course he chooses,
he will be saying that he is not the man _ and he does not see the
Soviet Union as the kind of place _ that the West had been led to
expect.''
   The Scots, Welsh and Basques sent messages of support to
Lithuania. Along with nationalist and linguistically separate
groups in Belgium and Germany, they have formed ``The European
Freedom Alliance'' of 15 legislators in the 518-member European
Parliament.
   They are pressing for a Europe-wide declaration of support for
Lithuania, and feel the Lithuanian example has helped their own
causes.
   ``It's marvelous to see the emergence of nations who have been
subsumed by an empire just as Scotland has been subsumed by the
British empire,'' said Margaret Ewing, a Scottish nationalist in
the House of Commons.
   Outside the nationalist groups, few see the issue in such
straightforward terms.
   Dominic Lieven, a political scientist at the London School of
Economics, said Gorbachev never intended to let Lithuania leave the
Soviet Union without negotiations, because of the precedent it
would set.
   ``It would be a standing incentive for other republics to do the
same, and for Gorbachev that would be a short road to disaster,''
he said in an interview.
   ``For the Western governments, there are different pressures.
They know the complete disintegration of the Soviet Union would
have an immensely destabilizing effect ... but, first, they also
believe Gorbachev is their best bet.''

   A South Korean fishing boat sank Saturday after
being struck by a Panamanian-registered freighter off Nagasaki in
western Japan, and two fishermen were reported missing, the coast
guard said.
   The freighter, the 1,574-ton Crystal 1, rescued seven of the
nine-member crew of the fishing boat, identified as the 90-ton
class Yil Shin-ho, the Nagasaki detachment of the Maritime Safety
Agency said.
   Two coast guard patrol boats conducted an overnight search in
the area about 25 miles southwest of Osezaki in the southern Goto
islands, officials said.
   Coast guard authorities were investigating the cause of the
collision, in which the freighter rammed into the right side of the
fishing boat during mild weather, the officials added. No further
details were immediately available.

<HEAD>Watchdogs Say USDA Moving Slowly Toward 20th Century Before It
Ends</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also moved in advance as b0791 of March 27.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congressional watchdogs continue to nip at the
Agriculture Department in hopes the creaky old agency will
modernize itself before the 20th century ends.
   But the structure and inertia of USDA are formidable. Attempts
have been made for 45 years _ largely unsuccessful _ to streamline
departmental field structure and management.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has been studying USDA organization and departmental
inhibitions for at least two years. A preliminary report was issued
in December.
   Formal responses to GAO's analysis will be sought from
departmental agencies and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
when the final report is ready later in the year.
   Meanwhile, the GAO has followed up its initial review with a
supplemental report to Yeutter about the need for improved
workforce planning in his department. Such planning should be
mandatory, the GAO said.
   At its simplest, workforce planning means getting the right
people in the right jobs, now and over the long haul. The object is
to deliver government services to the public, efficiently and
economically.
   The problems involve 36 agencies that carry out the department's
policies and programs. In 1988, the GAO said, those functions cost
taxpayers more than $44 billion and required the services of
110,000 full-time employees in more than 15,000 places around the
world.
   ``USDA agencies are experiencing problems recruiting highly
skilled workers, providing adequate training to employees,
developing effective managers, and managing a culturally diverse
workforce,'' the latest report said. ``These problems are
longstanding, pervasive and will likely continue given present
trends in USDA and in the federal government.''
   The growing importance of food safety, water quality and
biotechnology requires more scientists in USDA's workforce. Yet a
shortage of scientists generally, as well as competition from the
private sector, put USDA at a disadvantage.
   Moreover, the report said, agencies within USDA ``sometimes find
themselves competing against each other for people from the same
job occupations, a condition which is counterproductive from a
departmental standpoint.''
   Another inhibitor has been the lack of a departmental recruiting
program. Each USDA agency goes its own way and generally does not
refer unneeded applicants to other agencies.
   However, the report noted that the department's Office of
Personnel has recently contracted to develop a videotape for
recruiting new employees.
   ``As the agricultural economy becomes more consumer-driven than
production-oriented, USDA needs employees with backgrounds in
marketing management to supplement the skills of their other
employees trained in the agricultural sciences,'' the report said.
   When the GAO looked at employee training, there were many
indications of ``poorly or inadequately trained staff'' in a number
of areas. Also, the report cited ``continuing problems in achieving
and maintaining an ethnically diverse workforce'' of women and
minorities.
   A major GAO complaint is that department agencies generally
address only a single year's needs to patch up a problem when
long-range remedies are in order. This has been apparent in the
Farmers Home Administration and the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, for example.
   But the report said some USDA agencies ``are laying the
groundwork for effective workforce planning.''
   For example, the Forest Service uses a ``strategic human
resource guide'' to forecast skill-mix changes and attrition
through 1995. The forecasts are used in preparing annual job
recruitment recommendations and for measuring progress toward
employment goals.
   Another is the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which
is reorganizing its personnel function to include workforce
planning.
   ``Although these tentative steps toward workforce planning are
encouraging, without central direction and support the initiatives
may be stifled, and those agencies without workforce planning may
never develop it,'' the report said.
   GAO said department personnel leaders recognize the importance
of workforce planning ``but have not taken a leadership role in
developing ... guidance for agencies to follow nor have they
instituted a mechanism for tracking and monitoring individual
agency tracking systems.''
   The report acknowledged that department personnel officials
recently organized a task force to improve USDA's image as an
employer and thereby ``enhancing its ability to recruit and retain
quality employees.''
   But the GAO also noted that the department's personnel office
lacked the funds and people to operate the task force on its own,
so individual agencies were asked to chip in.
   ``However, there still exists no departmental policy on
workforce planning,'' the report said.
   ``Consistent workforce-planning standards and guidance are
needed to encourage all agencies to initiate workforce planning and
to reinforce agencies' efforts already undertaken,'' the report
said.

   Views of the western world's gardens, from
Central Park in New York to a 700-year-old German picture of
fruit-bearing palms in paradise, go on display Sunday as the
greeting to spring from the National Gallery of Art.
   In between is a painting of the huge vegetable and flower garden
around the house where Benjamin Franklin stayed as the first
official representative of the United States in Paris. In the
background is the Chateau Valentinois owned by Jacques de Chaumont,
Franklin's host.
   Money for the show, called ``Gardens on Paper,'' came from Estee
Lauder Inc., which makes perfumes and cosmetics.
   The 106 prints and drawings, all on paper or parchment, came
largely from the gallery's own collection. They include work by
Watteau, Fragonard, Piranesi, Whistler, Pisarro and Cassatt.
   The first pictures were done in the Middle Ages and are more
symbolic than realistic, including images of the false paradise or
garden of delights.
   ``In these delicious, perilous bowers, lovers succumb to the
promptings of the flesh and indulge in the pleasures of carnal
love, turning away from their pursuit of spiritual union with the
Divine in the true paradise,'' the catalogue explains.
   The images of carnal love are also symbolic, however, and
unlikely to contribute to the current debate about whether museums
should show pictures that some viewers and members of Congress
consider obscene. In a 15th century Flemish ``Book of Hours,''
Adam, Eve and the golden-haired snake are all nude but unrevealing.
   The catalogue was written by Virginia Tuttle Clayton, assistant
curator of the gallery's Department of Prints and Drawings.
   Other sections of the show cover the Renaissance period and the
18th and 19th centuries. The one definitely 20th century work is
the last, Maurice Prendergast's ``Central Park, 1900.''
   It closes on July 22 and unlike many of the gallery's shows,
will only be seen in Washington.

<HEAD>Child-Care Bill Would Cut Aid for Middle-Class Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major child-care assistance bill passed by
the House would take away the only government help that many
middle-class and upper-income families get for child care.
   To provide funds for the $27 billion measure, which primarily
benefits lower-income families, Democratic sponsors put limits on
the dependent-care tax credit that is popular with many
professionals and two-income households.
   More than 500,000 taxpayers took the dependent-care credit in
1986, the last year for which the Internal Revenue Service could
provide figures. Congressional tax estimates figure roughly 900,000
would be affected in 1991.
   Families of all income levels are eligible for the credit
designed to offset a portion of child care expenses: 20 percent to
30 percent, depending on income, of eligible expenses up to $4,800.
   But the House bill would reduce the credit for families with
combined incomes over $70,000 a year and end it entirely at $90,000.
   Families at that level are regarded as upper income and
affluent, and they had few defenders in the House debate.
   Some lawmakers did have reservations about eliminating the
deduction. They said the issue is more complex than merely soaking
the rich or targeting the yuppies.
   ``In many states, $70,000 translates into a familiy headed by
two police officers or two teachers,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., who voted for the bill anyway.
   The heart of the child-care assistance bill, which passed
Thursday after months of wrangling, is an expansion of the earned
income tax credit, which goes to working families with children and
incomes up to about $20,000.
   The House bill, which is under a threat of veto by President
Bush, is headed for a conference committee to resolve differences
with the Senate's version.
   The bill the Senate passed last year does not reduce the
dependent-care credit. It is less costly than the House version and
provides smaller tax credits to the poor.
   A sponsor of the House bill, Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., had
little sympathy for those seeking to save the credit. The House
bill includes money to establish a system of day care based in the
public schools that would be available to all families for a price.
   Downey said that was a good tradeoff for middle class and more
affluent families.
   ``You'll notice a lack of the wagging of tongues on this
issue,'' Downey said. ``It was not a topic of debate. There was
fulsome recognition of the reality that middle class people needed
to be taken care of, and the way to do that was ... the
after-school program.''
   The revenue recovered by cutting the credit is relatively small.
The Congressional Budget Office put the amount at $1.5 billion over
five years. Sponsors came up with another $13 billion by extending
the telephone excise tax, but even with that the bill would add to
the federal deficit.
   Women's groups have been watching closely as Congress fashions
the bill. With 64 percent of women working outside the home, child
care is a business expense just as necessary as a salesman's car,
said Nancy Duff Campbell, managing partner of the National Women's
Law Center, a lobbying group.
   ``If you're going to take away work-related benefits, that's
fine, but do it across the board, not just for dependents and child
care _ do it for business lunches and luxury trips,'' she said.
``What we object to is singling out this benefit that's so
important to women.''
   The credit covers more than just child care. Also affected are
the expenses of special care for other dependents, such as an
infirm parent or disabled spouse or older child.
   And it affects currently untaxed employer benefits, she said.
For people above the cutoff level, employer-offered child care
programs at free or reduced cost will become a taxable benefit.
   Eliminating the credit has been attempted before. House
Democrats included it in the 1988 welfare reform bill. But it was
eliminated in the Senate, where Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., attacked
the move as ``robbing Jill to pay Jane.''

<HEAD>Former Death Row Inmate Among Seven Jail Escapees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven prisoners, one of them just taken
off death row, were still at large today after an evening breakout
from the Yellowstone County jail.
   One prisoner, Cecil Thornell, 40, was captured at a residence in
Billings, but further details were not immediately available, said
police Sgt. Rich St. John.
   Jailers discovered the breakout at 9:45 p.m. Friday, Sheriff
Mike Shafer said. The prisoners apparently scaled the 10-foot brick
wall of a small recreation yard and cut through a chain-link screen
that covered it, the sheriff said.
   Shafer said bolt cutters or a hacksaw would have been needed to
cut the screen, and he said they may have had help.
   One escapee was Bernard Fitzpatrick, 47, who spent almost 14
years on death row until federal courts overturned his death
sentence for the kidnap-murder of an 18-year-old grocery store
clerk during a robbery in Hardin.
   Fitzpatrick last week pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murder in
a plea bargain that will eliminate the death sentence, but insists
he is innocent. Judge G. Todd Baugh set no sentencing date.
   Fitzpatrick had been brought to Billings from the state prison
in Deer Lodge for the plea hearing. The other six jail escapees
were all awaiting trial.
   Thornell was charged with robbing a gasoline station while on
parole for armed robbery.
   The escapees also included Frank Belmarez, 22, of Billings, who
is charged with homicide and aggravated assault in the stabbing
death of his girlfriend outside a bar last October.
   The others were identified as Daniel Wilson, 27, of Laurel,
charged with suspicion of drug possession and criminal
endangerment; Tony Howland, 24, of Billings, charged with probation
violation for felony theft and possession of a weapon by a
prisoner; Kevin Devereaux, 26, of Poplar, a federal prisoner
charged with burglary and distribution of a controlled substance;
and Elwood Hall, 24, of Brockton, scheduled for trial on Monday on
charges of aggravated sexual abuse.

<TEXT>
   A clergyman convicted of sedition for
entries he made in his desk diary has been sentenced to six years
in prison as part of a government crackdown on what it calls
``rumormongers.''
   The Rev. Lawford N. Imunde, a minister with the Presbyterian
Church of East Africa, pleaded guilty to the charge Friday. Imunde
was unrepresented at the hearing.
   ``These writings were scandalous, to say the least,'' prosecutor
Bernard Chunga said. ``They belittled the government and clearly
show contempt of the law.''
   Chunga did not read the entries in court but gave copies to
Chief Magistrate George Omondi Tunya.
   Imunde, a Kenyan, was arrested in a Nairobi suburb March 19. He
was charged Wednesday, hours after a judge ordered police to
explain why they had detained the clergyman.
   He was the first person charged since the crackdown began in
mid-February following the murder of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko.
More than 40 people have been detained for questioning without
charge, but most have been released in a matter of hours.
   Several Kenyan politicians, including President Daniel arap Moi,
have complained that unidentified individuals were attemping to
discredit the government by spreading rumors that the state
engineered Ouko's murder.

<HEAD>IsraeliExperts Say Pre-Emptive Strike Against Iraq Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is unlikely to stage a pre-emptive
strike against Iraq despite revelations that the Arab nation may
have an advanced nuclear weapons program, political analysts said
Saturday.
   ``Iraq now has missiles, and they are telling us in so many
words that they will be using them if we strike,'' said Amatzia
Bar-Am, an Iraq specialist at Haifa University. ``I don't think
Israel would be foolish enough to start this kind of cycle of
violence.''
   ``The situation in the Middle East has changed since 1981,'' he
said, referring to Israel's bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor
that Israel said could have been used to produce nuclear weapons.
Iraq said the facility was to be used for peaceful purposes.
   U.S. newspaper reports, citing classified CIA material, have
said Iraq has positioned missile launchers in the western part of
the country, within range of Tel Aviv.
   The Israeli government has not commented following Wednesday's
arrest in London of five people in an alleged plot to smuggle
nuclear weapons triggers to Iraq.
   ``We have no comment on it. It's something that happened between
England and Iraq,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud said
Saturday. Aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir have also refused
to comment.
   Political observers said Israel's verbal restraint was a sign
that it did not want to escalate tensions with Iraq, one of its
most implacable enemies in the Middle East.
   Iraq, meanwhile, has accelerated its rhetoric. Responding to the
arrests in Britain, Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoun,
said ``the current British campaign is trying to provide the
groundwork for an Israeli aggression against Iraq, reminding us of
the year 1981.''
   But Bar-Am said another strike was unfeasible. He noted that in
1981 the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad provided a clear
target for Israeli warplanes, but Iraq's current nuclear program is
spread across the country.
   ``There is no easily identifiable target that you hit and then
get rid of the whole nuclear option,'' he said. ``There doesn't
seem to exist anywhere an atomic reactor.''
   Israeli military analysts have estimated that Iraq is less than
five years away from developing nuclear weapons and that it was
making rapid strides in producing other unconventional weapons.
   ``They are making an effort, not only in the nuclear field, but
also with regards to missiles, to chemical weapons and to
biological weapons,'' said Zeev Eitan, a senior analyst with Tel
Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, in an
interview with Israel radio broadcast Saturday.
   Political analysts agreed with Bar-Am that hostilities between
Israel and Iraq were unlikely in the near future because of mutual
deterrence, but warned that a major crisis in the Middle East could
set off a confrontation between the region's two mightiest military
powers.

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Increases Sunday for First Time Since 1981</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's minimum wage increases for the
first time in nearly a decade Sunday, but it won't lift millions of
low-wage workers above the poverty level.
   The minimum wage, paid to about 3 million Americans, increases
from $3.35 an hour to $3.80 and will go to $4.25 an hour next April
1. The new law also establishes a subminimum training wage for
certain teen-age workers.
   Critics say the increase should have been greater.
   ``Right now, it's not at a level where people can pull
themselves out of poverty,'' said Jo Ann Mort of the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
   ``When people hear minimum wage, they think children working
after school, and that's not the reality of it. The reality is that
adults are trying to support families on this,'' Mort said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., last week called the size of
the increase a ``disgrace'' and said he would push Congress next
year to bring the wage to ``a level that is fair to millions of
workers who are being unfairly exploited now.''
   Kennedy blamed the size of the increase on the Bush
administration, which vetoed a proposal last year to raise the wage
to $4.55 an hour.
   The increase was ``the best we could do against an anti-worker
administration that refuses to do justice for America's working
poor,'' said Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   The administration considers the increase an equitable boost
that will result in fewer jobs being lost than under the $4.55
proposal, White House spokesman Stephen Hart said.
   Polls have shown a majority of Americans support a minimum wage
of at least $5 an hour.
   The minimum wage was established in 1938 as part of the first
Fair Labor Standards Act. During its first 40 years, Congress acted
six times to keep the rate at about 50 percent of the average
hourly earnings of all non-supervisory employees.
   The $3.35 rate, which equaled 48 percent of the national average
earnings in 1981, fell to an all-time low of 35 percent of the
nation's average earnings last year, according to the AFL-CIO.
   After Sunday's increase, full-time minimum-wage workers will
still be $516 a year short of what the government figures it takes
to support a family of two at the poverty level and $4,796 below
the basic needs level for a family of four. The government placed
the poverty level for a family of four at $12,700 in February.
   Still, the boost in the minimum wage may help millions of other
low-paid workers. For instance, companies paying $4 or $4.50 an
hour may decide to raise wages 45 cents to keep trained workers.
   There are more than 11 million Americans making less than $4.50
an hour and nearly 15 million making under $5 an hour, according to
the Labor Department.
   Under the new law, workers ages 16 to 19 may be paid a
subminimum training wage for their first three months in the work
force and for an additional 90 days if the employer has a formal
training program.
   The training wage will be $3.35 an hour when the minimum wage
rises to $3.80 an hour and $3.62 an hour when the minimum wage
reaches $4.25 next April. Migrant seasonal farmworkers are exempt
from the subminimum and the entire subminimum provision expires in
April 1993.
   The wage that employers are required to pay workers who receive
tips will increase to 45 percent of the minimum wage, providing
that tips bring workers' hourly pay to at least the minimum. The
percentage, which was 40 percent before Sunday, goes to 50 percent
a year from now.
   The level at which small businesses are exempt from the federal
minimum wage increases from $362,500 in gross sales to $500,000.
   Hundreds of special exemptions exist, such as for some farm
workers, including tobacco leaf harvesters, casual babysitters,
newspaper delivery workers, amusement park employees, wreath
makers, employees at small radio stations in cities with fewer than
25,000 residents and mollusk and crustacean harvesters.

<HEAD>Contents Of Storage Tanks At Nuclear Reservation Sometimes A
Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a potentially explosive witches'
brew cooking inside 177 nuclear waste storage tanks at the Hanford
nuclear reservation.
   Surrounded by steel and concrete, buried under several feet of
earth, and roasting at temperatures of 140 degrees, the radioactive
slurry changes in ways that scientists cannot always predict.
   Scientists working for the U.S. Department of Energy concluded
that hydrogen gas trapped beneath the hard crust of the waste in 20
of the tanks could explode, releasing up to 3 million curies of
radiation from a single tank.
   The wastes are generated by nuclear weapons production.
   Hanford was created as part of the Manhattan Project to beat
Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb during World War II. The Department
of Energy, in a cost-cutting move, recently announced it is
shutting down the only federal reactor still operating in the
south-central Washington town.
   ``We've got good data on what went into those tanks,'' Don
Wodrich, a scientist with contractor Westinghouse Hanford Co., said
last week. ``But over the years, it blended together and mixed. Now
it's more complicated.''
   The insides of the tanks are far too lethal for human entry. All
scientists can do is monitor the temperature and vapors escaping
through filtered vents, and occasionally send a probe into the guck.
   But probes of the 20 suspect tanks have been stopped, because
scientists fear a spark could trigger an explosion.
   The explosion potential was announced March 23, along with a
unique admission that DOE really isn't sure how dangerous the
situation is. The agency said it will take until June to come up
with a solution plan.
   That has prompted criticism from Congress and a citizens'
watchdog group, who contend the department knew about the danger
years ago.
   The Energy Department have stated repeatedly that the explosion
risk is low, although they will not have a safety analysis
completed for two weeks.
   Spokesman Ken Morgan has said there is more danger to the public
from a gasoline truck than from the tanks, and called the
controversy the ``cold fusion'' of disasters, referring to the
highly disputed claim that the nuclear process known as fusion can
be created in an ordinary laboratory.
   That attitude infuriates Hanford critics.
   ``They don't fully accept their responsibility to protect public
health and safety,'' said Jim Thomas of the Hanford Education
Action League in Spokane. ``They should have been doing risk
analysis on this stuff years ago.''
   Energy Department officials insisted last week they became aware
of the explosion potential only in February, even though they
detected hydrogen in the wastes as early as 1983.
   Hanford Manager Mike Lawrence, in announcing the problem, said
he had become aware of the danger only the day before. If that is
the case, said Thomas, then Hanford apparently has major management
problems.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said a study prepared for the Energy
Department in June 1985 warned of potential problems with gases in
some Hanford tanks. That report examined only the liquid and solid
waste in the tanks, but said the gases should be addressed in
another study.
   Wyden said the 1985 report ``seems to contradict this whole
notion that the Energy Department didn't know anything about it.''
   The 1985 hydrogen study was a companion to another study on
whether ferrocyanide in some tanks could explode. The ferrocyanide
report was leaked to reporters last October.
   Under criticism for its handling of that issue, the Energy
Department decided to take a broader look at the explosion
potential in all Hanford tanks, and scientists discovered the
hydrogen problem in late February, scientist Wodrich said.
   The explosion threat is apparently not similar to the presumed
cause of a nuclear waste storage tank explosion in the Soviet Union
in 1957 that may have killed hundreds.
   Al Conklin of the state Office of Radiation Protection said the
Soviet explosion involved a different mixture of chemicals and a
lengthy breakdown of the tank's cooling system.
   The DOE is most concerned about one tank, called 101-SY, that
contains 1 million gallons of mixed radioactive waste. Some wastes
dumped into the tank in the 1970s contained organics, which are now
decomposing and giving off hydrogen gas. The organics were used to
separate radioactive strontium from other wastes before they were
stored.
   The most dangerous gases are those trapped in air pockets under
the hard crust. Scientists are unsure how much gas is beneath the
waste, although they credit the gas with raising the waste level by
up to 33 inches.
   Wodrich said DOE officials are confident the explosion risk is
low because the hydrogen gas has apparently existed in the waste
for years, and that new precautions are being taken to prevent an
explosion.
   In a briefing for state regulators, Wodrich said tank 101-SY was
completed in 1976 and is 75 feet in diameter and 35 feet tall. The
double-walled tank contains about 32 feet of waste.
   The tank also contains 8,000 gallons of water inserted in
1984-1988, when DOE made an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the gas
buildup by breaking through the crust. The crust develops from the
drying of the wastes.

^Latin American Incomes Fell Again in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incomes fell again in Latin America last year,
deepeningt an overall decline for the decade of the 1980s,
according to a report published Saturday by the Inter-American
Development Bank.
   Production in the area grew by only 0.7 percent for the year.
Since population grew by about 2.4 percent a year _ more than three
times as fast _ the average person's income went down.
   Incomes declined by 8 percent over the 10 years, back to the
level of 1978.
   ``The region's disappointing overall growth masks good
performance in a number of countries,'' the report said.
   It added that many have acted to improve their performance in
the 1990s. But it warned:
   ``Without sustained expansion in investment, output and
employment, the deterioration in living conditions suffered by
large segments of the region's population during the 1980s will
continue in the decade ahead.''
   The last two countries to emerge from dictatorship, Chile and
Paraguay, turned in the best records.
   After a sharp decline in the first half of the 1980s, production
in Chile perked up to an exceptional 8.5 percent last year. That
growth rate, combined with a population increase smaller than most
countries in the area, gave it by far the best increase in incomes.
   But according to the World Bank, the average Chilean received
the equivalent of only $1,510 in 1988, the latest year for which
figures are available. That is well below the level for the area.
   The average Brazilian earned $2,280, the average Mexican $1,820
and the average U.S. citizen $19,780.
   Production in seven out of 25 countries declined last year, with
the biggest drop in Peru: 14 percent. Peru's record was due in part
to a continuing leftist rebellion by ``Shining Path'' guerrillas.
   Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's most populous countries,
managed 3 percent increases in production despite problems with
debt and inflation.
   The bank itself, owned by 44 member countries, disbursed a
record $2.5 billion in loans and spent a record $61 million on
technical aid last year. It has loans outstanding on $122 billion
worth of projects designed to raise living standards in the area.
   After a three-year slump, the amount of new loans approved rose
in 1989 to $2.6 billion.
   The increases came after three years of negotiation by the
United States and other contributing governments to get more power
over the bank's lending.
   They can now delay a proposed loan for as long as a year. The
bank has also begun a program of quickly-disbursed loans,
conditioned on promises by the borrowing countries to change their
policies and put themselves in better condition to repay.

   Americans are being asked to sit down, take
out a pencil and count themselves on Sunday.
   It's the 21st time the United States has taken its own measure.
   And like a youngster standing against the wall, the result is
bigger every time.
   ``Our goal for the 1990 census is to count every person resident
in the United States,'' said Thomas Murrin, deputy secretary of
Commerce. ``We are ready and confident....''
   ``It's important to answer the census. It's safe to answer the
census,'' said Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant, stressing
that information on individuals is kept confidential.
   The national count isn't just a case of idle curiosity on the
part of the government.
   The Constitution requires a count every 10 years to reassign
seats in the House of Representatives among the states.
   And other information collected is used to determine the need
for many social programs and to decide which states, cities and
towns most need federal money to help their residents in one way or
another.
   ``In many respects the census is an index to our quality of
life,'' said John G. Keane of Notre Dame University, former head of
the Census Bureau. ``The census shows us anew where our nation
hurts and needs help.''
   ``Recite the national agenda and we realize how its resolution
is directly or indirectly rooted in census data,'' he said.
   ``The aging population, births, deaths, education, household
composition, housing quality, income and poverty, fertility, single
parent families, occupations, population mobility, disability, the
homeless are just a few examples of what the census covers,'' Keane
said.
   Census forms were sent to about 85 million homes 10 days ago,
and government workers will visit millions more where mailing lists
were not available.
   Most people got the short form with just 14 questions. The long
form, which went to one home in six, has much more detail, forming
a sort of giant national survey.
   Although Sunday is officially designated as Census Day, many
people completed their forms and sent them in ahead of time.
   That's just fine with the government.
   It's the folks who don't respond who are a problem.
   Far too many people ``approach the census as a ho-hum event.
They should not, for the census is vital to our way of life and our
quality of life,'' said Keane.
   A decade ago 75 percent of the people who received forms in the
mail completed them and sent them back.
   The country is bigger and more complex today. The bureau is
hoping to get back 70 percent this time.
   Sending workers out to find people who don't respond costs
taxpayers $10 million for each 1 percent.
   Yet the bureau is determined to come as close as possible to
counting everyone.
   ``We are prepared to chase and chase and chase again,'' said
Bryant.
   But while the count is getting lots of attention right now,
don't expect instant results. It's not like an election, where
preliminary reports come out based on a few precincts or cities.
   The Census Bureau keeps all the data it collects strictly
confidential until it can be compiled into detailed reports and
then made public _ in such a way that no individuals can be
identified from the material.
   The first result from the count won't be reported until Dec. 31,
when the bureau as to tell the president how many people live in
each state and how many members of the House of Representatives
that state is entitled to.
   More detailed reports on individual states will be issued
starting after the first of the year. The schedule isn't determined
yet, depending on how well things go in individual states.
   Those reports will include such information as age, sex, race
and household relationships, marital status, whether people are
Hispanic or not and a variety of housing data.

<HEAD>Number of Foreign Journalists Dwindles in Lithuania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of Western journalists covering
Lithuania's standoff with Moscow from the Baltic republic's capital
has dropped sharply since the Soviet government ordered the area
closed to most foreigners.
   More than 100 journalists based in Moscow and other European
capitals followed events from the Lithuanian capital, but most were
expected to be out of Vilnius on Sunday. Only a handful remained on
Saturday.
   Despite the greater freedom of movement permitted under
glasnost, Soviet authorities have routinely closed areas stricken
by ethnic violence to foreign journalists. Some regions regarded as
strategically or politically sensitive are closed at all times,
others only temporarily.
   The order restricting journalists' access to Lithuania came as
the Kremlin increased pressure on the rebellious republic and as
Lithuanian leaders sought to use the Western media to protect them
from a use of force to crush their effort to establish an
independent state.
   Moscow-based foreign journalists must give the Soviet Foreign
Ministry advance notice of any plans to travel outside the Soviet
capital, including the dates and means of their travel and where
they will stay outside Moscow.
   The Soviet government may refuse to permit the trip, temporarily
closing areas to foreigners. The Foreign Ministry on March 23
stopped permitting most Moscow-based reporters from traveling to
Lithuania and ordered a number of diplomats out of the republic.
   However, journalists already in Lithuania were permitted to stay.
   Four days later, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskykh
told a Moscow news briefing that ``foreigners have been asked to
leave the borders of Lithuania and temporarily refrain from
entering its territory.''
   Most correspondents accredited by the Foreign Ministry began
returning to Moscow, but The Associated Press and some other
organizations kept their journalists in place until contacted
directly by Foreign Ministry officials.
   On Friday, Foreign Ministry officials called news organizations
with correspondents remaining in Vilnius and said they must leave
by Sunday.
   The AP, which still had a reporter and two photographers
covering the story, said it would comply with the ministry's
instructions by the deadline.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is rooting for both sides in
the battle of wills between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and the breakaway republic of Lithuania.
   On the one hand, Bush defends the right of self-determination
for Lithuania.
   On the other hand, he doesn't want to see Gorbachev weakened or
driven from power as a result of Lithuania's push to secede from
the Soviet Union.
   Despite U.S. warnings against using force, Gorbachev faces
mounting pressures at home to take a hard line toward Lithuania,
officials say. And there is a widespread belief in Washington that
a crackdown would produce a severe backlash against Moscow.
   ``We have big equities in this,'' a senior administration
official said.
   ``It isn't in anybody's interest to have this thing blow up,''
the official added. ``Nobody really wins from the blowup.''
   Bush sent Gorbachev a letter Thursday night which White House
officials said restated U.S. views on Lithuania and underscored
hopes for a peaceful dialogue to resolve the dispute.
   ``I want to be sure that the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we're not trying to make things difficult for
Lithuania or the Soviet Union or anybody else,'' Bush said.
   Yet, the administration ordered a postponement of a visit to
Moscow by Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the U.S. Army chief of staff. His
host would have been the Soviet commander in Lithuania, and U.S.
officials said that would have been inappropriate.
   A crackdown would spoil Lithuanian dreams of independence, give
the Soviets a black eye in world opinion and disrupt the smooth
path of superpower relations, U.S. officials say.
   The casualties could include hopes for a U.S.-Soviet nuclear
weapons treaty, as well as agreements on chemical weapons and
conventional forces in Europe, as well as a planned summit between
Bush and Gorbachev.
   ``It is fair to say that if President Gorbachev resorts to
force, then all bets are off,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., warned.
   ``The Soviets will be in real trouble here _ no trade
agreements, no trade preferences and no more of the kind of
relations the Kremlin is desperately seeking from Washington,''
Dole said. ``It would be a severe blow to U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   White House officials agree with Dole's assessment, but have
muted their criticisms and warnings. Their goal is not to push
Gorbachev into a corner where it would be difficult for him to make
concessions.
   ``Were it not for Gorbachev and the enlightened positions he's
taken ... we wouldn't be talking about Lithuanian independence,''
the administration official said.
   The administration points to Gorbachev as the architect of
reform in his country who tolerated democratic reforms throughout
Eastern Europe.
   ``Sure, we have a preferred outcome for the Lithuanians,'' the
official said. ``But we also have _ and the world has _ some pretty
big equities in what's going on now. And so what we're trying to do
is preserve those, as well.''
   One theory circulating among high-level officials in the
administration is that Gorbachev is trying to slow the Lithuanian
process until he can get a bill through the Supreme Soviet spelling
out terms for secession.
   ``It's pretty stiff,'' one official said of Gorbachev's bill.
``There are pretty high barriers to get across.''
   In contrast to other foreign policy issues, Bush has been spared
criticism from Congress about his guarded approach.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Congress is playing a
supporting role in a classic ``good cop-bad cop'' routine.
   ``Our role is to demand (independence) today, even though it may
not be possible for a month,'' D'Amato said. ``It is to be
outspoken. I think we can be a useful tool (for Bush) and I don't
mind lending ourselves for that purpose.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Bush ``is obviously engaged in
a very difficult balancing act.
   ``There is concern that Gorbachev not be pushed into a
precipitous act, that time be gained whereby there can be a
negotiation that will let Gorbachev save face and still bring about
the independence and freedom of Lithuania,'' Wilson said.
   The administration is unsure what will happen in Lithuania.
   ``Our first objective is to try to prevent (a blowup), try to
get things down, reduce tensions, stop ultimatums from being
issued, preconditions, get people talking calmly and rationally,''
the senior official said.
   However, the official said, ``If Gorbachev is trying to keep
Lithuania in, and the Lithuanians are trying to get out, they both
can't win.'' Yet, the official added, there are possible avenues
for compromise, such as giving Lithuania sovereignty but requiring
it to defer to Moscow on foreign policy and defense issues.
   ``There are lots of different ways,'' the official concluded.

   Here is the text of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's message Saturday to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, as
carried by the Tass news agency. The statement was read by
announcers on Radio Moscow and Soviet television.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The incumbent Lithuanian leadership does not heed the voice of
reason. It continues to ignore the decision of the third,
extraordinary Congress of U.S.S.R. People's Deputies and is taking
unilateral steps that run counter to the U.S.S.R. Constitution and
that are openly challenging and insulting to the entire union.
   I want to declare yet again that this road is ruinous and will
only lead to a dead end.
   I urge the deputies of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet to
understand this truth and their historical responsibility for the
interests of the people of Lithuania _ Lithuanians and
non-Lithuanians, for their security and well being, for the destiny
of democracy in the whole of our country and of stability in the
world.
   I propose that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet immediately annul
the illegal acts it has adopted. Such a step will open a
possibility for discussing the entire range of problems on the
solely acceptable basis _ within the framework of the U.S.S.R.
constitution.

<HEAD>Sales Tax Hike in Kansas City to Fund Anti-Drug Efforts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war on drugs picks up new recruits
here Sunday, when each person who buys something in Jackson County
begins chipping in to help authorities arrest, jail and treat
abusers.
   The Kansas City metropolitan area, faced with one of the
nation's worst drug problems, is raising taxes by an estimated $14
million a year to help authorities tackle a drug culture boosted by
the infiltration of Los Angeles gangs.
   The one-quarter-cent rise in sales tax will generate nearly $100
million over its seven-year life from over-the-counter sales in
Jackson County, which incorporates Kansas City and its suburbs.
   The nation's 29th largest metropolitan area ranks sixth in the
availability of crack, and police believe that one-third or moer of
last year's 141 killings were drug-related.
   ``I am not aware of any approach like it in the United States,''
said Larry Myers, administrator of the Jackson County Juvenile
Court. ``I guarantee there are other communities watching to see
what the outcome is.''
   Voters in Jackson County authorized the tax in November. Since
then, officials have been putting together plans to use the money.
   It will enable the county prosecutor to add about 25 prosecutors
to his staff, and the Kansas City Police Department and the Jackson
County Drug Enforcement Task Force to hire 30 more officers each.
That will cost each department $1.5 million a year.
   The campaign focuses primarily on enforcement, but $2.5 million
a year is earmarked for drug rehabilitation programs, $1 million
for community crime prevention programs and $1.5 million for a
deferral program that would allow first-time offenders to receive
drug counseling and avoid criminal charges.
   ``I'm really excited about this because it's systemwide,'' Myers
said. ``If it was only law enforcement, it'd be just stacking up
kids and adults in the court system.''
   Kansas City's drug problems have mushroomed in recent years, and
police Chief Larry Joiner said enforcement officials estimate 35
percent to 40 percent of last year's 141 homicides were
drug-related. Police say the problems have been aggravated in
recent years by Los Angeles gangs spreading their drug-dealing to
Midwest cities.
   Police in outlying suburban areas also welcome the additional
funds.
   ``We don't have the numbers of crack houses and dope houses, or
people soliciting off the street corners, like they do in Kansas
City,'' said Howard Brown, chief of police in Blue Springs, an
eastern Jackson County community of about 40,000.
   ``But we do have a drug problem, there's no doubt. It's not
running rampant, but there are drugs available in the school system
_ that's one thing we want to make drug-free.''
   Brown will be able to hire three officers for his 45-member
staff. Once they're trained, they will replace three seasoned
officers who will be assigned to the expanded county drug task
force, begun three years ago with a private donation and kept going
through federal grants.
   The county task force has ``been operating on a shoestring,''
Brown said. ``We're pretty enthused now that we'll have enough
people to really hit the streets and enough money to get involved
in making more buys.''
   But others foresee problems with the tax and the programs it
will finance.
   Charles Megerman, the county corrections director, says he
doesn't know what the drug program will mean for a jail already
filled well beyond capacity.
   ``There are a whole host of options, from renting space to
double-bunking to building a new jail,'' he said.
   And Jack Hackley, a real estate agent from suburban Oak Grove
and a member of the county Economic Development Commission who
spoke out against the new tax, said he might start a petition drive
to repeal it.
   Hackley said the tax swept in on the strength of national
hysteria over drugs, and thinks the extent of the drug problem has
been grossly exaggerated.
   ``This is the biggest mistake the taxpayers have ever made,'' he
said. ``It should be repealed immediately. For all that money, we
could take every drug addict in Jackson County and ship them to the
Betty Ford Clinic.''

   Premier Xenophon Zolotas on Saturday fired
Greece's intelligence service chief because he was late in briefing
him on allegations that his agency was jamming the broadcasts of an
illegal TV station.
   Zolotas summoned the heads of the four ministries and National
Information Service chief Dimitris Angelopoulos to an emergency
meeting, the government spokesman said. The meeting was called
after two intelligence agents were arrested Friday night and
accused of jamming transmissions of the Channel 29 television
station.
   Angelopoulos arrived at the meeting two hours late and was
dismissed.
   ``Mr. Angelopoulos showed inexcusable negligence in the
performance of his duties by not immediately briefing his superior,
in this case the prime minister, who had sought him repeatedly and
with every means at his disposal,'' government spokesman Prokopis
Pavlopoulos said.
   The commercial Channel 29 television station, one of several
operating without a license, aired footage of two men being
arrested on Mount Hymettos near Athens. It accused them of using
electronic equipment to jam broadcasts from the station's nearby
antenna.
   The two men were released after the intelligence service assured
police and judicial authorities that they were agents acting on
official orders, the Public Order Ministry said in a statement. It
did not eleborate.
   Zolotas ordered an inquiry into the incident by the Public
Order, Justice and Transport and Communications ministries.
   The government urged political parties to maintain a calm
climate before next week's general elections.
   The socialists, who are supported by Channel 29, accused the
conservative New Democracy party of being behind the alleged
jamming. The conservatives denied involvement and urged an official
inquiry into the matter.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials See Favorable Prospects for Peace in El Salvador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A variety of pressures on both sides in El
Salvador's civil war have created the most favorable climate for a
peaceful settlement since the conflict began a decade ago,
according to U.S. officials.
   The new mood has been highlighted by the plans of Salvadoran
government officials and leftist guerrilla representatives to hold
peace talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
next Wednesday in Geneva.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said he is hopeful a
peace settlement can be reached this year. The death toll in El
Salvador since 1980 is believed to exceed 70,000.
   The electoral defeat of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua
five weeks ago is seen as a costly blow to the rebels in light of
the support they have received from that country for more than a
decade.
   The U.S. officials, speaking only on condition they not be
named, said the Sandinistas have sharply increased military
deliveries to the rebels since the Feb. 25 elections. The
Sandinista goal apparently is to help the rebels as much as
possible before they leave office on April 25.
   Still, the rebels are not the same fighting force they were a
year ago. Much of their strength was sapped in a November military
uprising that failed to touch off the nationwide anti-government
uprising which U.S. officials said the rebels had hoped for.
   Internationally, support for a negotiated settlement is strong.
The Soviet Union, reflecting a changed attitude, issued an appeal
last November during the rebel offensive for an ``immediate end to
the bloodshed'' and for peace talks.
   The Soviet statement contrasted sharply with the expressions of
strong support for the guerrillas by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   The future of Cuban aid to the rebels is now in doubt with the
defeat of the Sandinistas. Cuba routinely has used Nicaragua as a
transit point for military deliveries to the FMLN rebels, U.S.
officials have said.
   The government of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani also is
facing pressures to seek an accommodation.
   Peace would bring a needed lift to the Salvadoran economy, whose
performance has been aggravated by falling prices of coffee, a
major Salvadoran export.
   Salvadoran officials also are aware that there are limits to the
generosity of the United States, which contributed more than $3
billion in aid during the 1980s.
   After reaching $301.4 million last year, the U.S. economic aid
level for 1990 is $227.9 million, a drop of about 25 percent.
   The decline reflects U.S. weariness with the Salvadoran conflict
and the increased demands on U.S. aid dollars, brought on by the
addition of new recipient countries in Eastern Europe.
   Moreover, Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., is leading a campaign to
impose strict conditions on U.S. military aid _ totaling almost
$100 million _ to El Salvador.
   His proposal, designed to promote a serious negotiating process,
is expected to be a contentious issue in the Congress this spring.
   U.S. officials are worried that the Dodd proposal could weaken
the Salvadoran government's negotiating hand. But they also stress
that the rebels' bargaining position also is weak, regardless of
the outcome of the Dodd proposal.
   The final form of a peace settlement is difficult to predict. At
a minimum, the officials said it would probably have to require
amnesty for rebel combatants and government security guarantees for
them.

<HEAD>Traffickers Threaten Stepped Up Bombings, Assassinations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stung by extraditions and military
raids, drug traffickers threatened Saturday to explode six-ton
dynamite bombs in Bogota and to target more judges, politicians,
police and journalists for assassination.
   The threat from the Medellin cocaine cartel, in a communique,
followed the government's extradition of a drug suspect to the
United States last week _ its first in two months _ and its
takeover of a town run by drug bosses.
   President Virgilio Barco said in a televised speech to the
nation Friday night that his government would not ease up in its
war on the traffickers. He was to leave Sunday for Paris, London
and Brussels to press European leaders to work hard to stem cocaine
consumption in their countries.
   The drug traffickers' message, sent by facsimile to the RCN
radio network, demanded an immediate end to the military occupation
of Envigado, the town seized last week, and the release of two men
arrested in the takeover.
   The 80,000-resident municipality is a stronghold of the cocaine
barons near their home base of Medellin.
   The message said a six-ton bomb would be detonated in the
capital for each new trafficking suspect extradited and that a bomb
of equal power would be set off in an unnamed Bogota upper class
neighborhood unless the military ends its occupation of Envigado.
   On Dec. 6, a 1,200-pound bomb set off by the traffickers in
Bogota killed 63 people and destroyed the headquarters of
Colombia's national police.
   The traffickers declared a unilateral cease-fire on Jan. 17,
appealing to the government to end extraditions in exchange for the
traffickers allowing themselves to be tried in Colombian courts.
   The government then halted extraditions, but resumed them
Wednesday when it sent Fernando Gutierrez, 29, to face trial in
Arizona on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. He was
the 15th such suspect extradited since Barco launched a crackdown
on the traffickers Aug. 18.
   The communique was attributed to ``The Extraditables,'' the name
adopted by the Medellin cartel after traffickers responded to
Barco's crackdown with a campaign of bombings and assassinations
that has claimed at least 210 lives.
   There was no way to verify the authenticity of the message.
However, the Extraditables have used the same format and means of
communication in the past.
   The country's National Security Council ordered the army and
anti-terrorism units from the national police into Envigado, where
18 policemen accused of being on the traffickers' payroll had been
arrested over the past two weeks.
   The message from the named the two men arrested in Envigado as
Jose Cristanto Retavista Garzon and Fredy Lopez Ospina.
   Neither is a major trafficker, but the cartel has hundreds of
middle-level traffickers and ``soldiers.''
   The message reiterated previous claims that the police are
arresting, torturing and killing ``friends'' of the traffickers,
who are responsible for some 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled
into the United States.
   ``We will execute judges, traitorous politicians, torturers and
principal members of the Cano family,'' it said.
   Drug traffickers killed the paper's publisher, Guillermo Cano,
with a burst of submachine gun fire as he left the newspaper's
officies on Dec. 17, 1987.
   El Espectador had been crusading for government action against
the traffickers. Cano's brother, sons and nephews continue to run
the newspaper, which was partially destroyed by a truck bomb last
year.
   A truck bomb set off by traffickers last year heavily damaged
the newspaper, which had to go to the United States to look for
financial aid to keep publishing.
   The threat by the traffickers to set off six-ton dynamite bombs
is not likely to be dismissed by the government.
   Targets in the traffickers's terror campaign have included a
Colombian airliner, which was blown apart by a bomb during a
domestic flight, killed all 106 people aboard. Small bombs have
gone off at churches, schools, supermarkets, banks and other
businesses.
   For its part, the government has killed one of the Medellin
cartel's leaders, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. It also has seized
traffickers' mansions, ranches, airplanes and yachts and troops
searching dozens of the traffickers' ranches have found $43 million
in cash and gold.
   The country's judges and leading politicians have been under
heavy guard since Aug. 18, when traffickers gunned down leading
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan during a campaign rally.
   Last week, another presidential candidate, leftist Bernardo
Jaramillo Ossa, was killed.
   In a communique, traffickers claimed responsibility and said the
front-runner in the race, Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal
Party, would be next. The elections are scheduled for May 26.

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
on Saturday postponed talks with the government on dismantling
apartheid, saying that police shootings of black protesters have
soured the negotiating climate.
   The move was considered a serious setback for efforts by the
government of President F.W. de Klerk to open black-white
discussions. De Klerk expressed regret over the violence, but urged
the ANC to reconsider its postponement.
   Nelson Mandela, the ANC's deputy president, told tens of
thousands of supporters that an April 11 meeting with the
government was put on hold indefinitely because ``state violence
against our people still continues.''
   He cited excessive police force against protesters on Monday
that left at least nine blacks dead and more than 400 injured in
Sebokeng. Police said they opened fire after protesters stoned a
police station in the township near Johannesburg and set fire to
municipal buildings.
   ``If the government talks about negotiations on the one hand and
massacres our people on the other hand, we cannot tolerate that,''
Mandela said at a packed sports stadium in the southern city of
Bisho, capital of the nominally independent Ciskei homeland.
   ``The conditions for the (ANC's) armed struggle still prevail,''
he added.
   Mandela said he acted on instructions from exiled ANC leaders in
Lusaka, Zambia, when he called de Klerk on Friday to tell him of
the postponement.
   He did not say what it would take to reschedule the talks, which
have been hailed as a groundbreaking effort to clear the way for
extending political rights to the country's 28 million black
majority.
   The Cabinet minister for black affairs, Constitutional
Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen, said the white-led government
was ``giving attention to the announcement's implications.'' He did
not elaborate.
   De Klerk said he was awaiting a full report on the violence, but
said the deaths should not be used to derail the proposed talks
between black leaders and the government.
   Zach de Beer, co-leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party
in the white chamber of Parliament, said ``the shooting at Sebokeng
was a deplorable episode, (but) it can be no excuse for breaking
off talks.''
   ``One can only express the heartfelt hope that the ANC will
think again, and quickly,'' de Beer added.
   ANC officials and other anti-apartheid leaders on Friday
persuaded Mandela to back out of a planned appearance with
political rival Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu homeland.
   The two had agreed _ on Mandela's initiative _ to make a joint
call for peace at a rally Monday in Natal Province, where fierce
fighting between pro-ANC and pro-Buthelezi blacks has claimed at
least 40 lives since Tuesday. Thousand of blacks caught up in the
violence have fled their homes.
   Mandela, released from 27 years of imprisonment Feb. 11, is the
effective head of the ANC while President Oliver Tambo recovers
from a stroke in Sweden. But events of the past two days suggest he
may not have the freedom to pursue his initiatives without the
approval of younger, more militant ANC leaders.
   In Lusaka, the ANC said it would hold a meeting within five days
to review developments in South Africa.
   The organization, the main black group fighting the government,
accused security forces of siding with Buthelezi's relatively
conservative Inkatha movement in the Natal province factional
fighting.
   ``Whereas in the past the regime's police turned a blind eye to
vigilante terror directed at the democratic movement, this week
they have actually actively participated in the massacres,'' the
ANC statement said.
   Mandela condemned the violence in Natal and elsewhere, but his
appeals have had no impact. Several weeks ago he told blacks in
Natal to throw their weapons ``into the sea.'' Since then, the
faction fighting has only intensified.
   Supporters of the ANC and Buthelezi's more conservative Inkatha
movement battled for political supremacy in Natal since 1986, and
at least 4,000 blacks have been killed.
   Buthelezi expressed shock at Mandela's decision not to attend a
rally Monday in the province.
   ``People are going to die while they (the ANC) delay,'' said
Buthelezi, who like Mandela has made unheeded pleas for an end to
the violence.
   The government has made clear that the ANC will be only one of
several black groups that would be present for formal negotiations
on a new constitution.
   De Klerk says he wants equal voting rights for all South
Africans. But he opposes outright black majority rule and envisions
a mechanism that will give the country's 5 million whites veto
power on major policy decisions.
   The ANC wants a one-person, one-vote democracy.

<HEAD>Authorities Capture Two of Seven Jail Breakers, Including Ex-Death
Row Inmate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two jail escapees, one of whom was taken
off death row only last week, were captured Saturday but four other
escapees from the Yellowstone County jail were still at large,
police said.
   Convicted murderer Bernard Fitzpatrick was among seven prisoners
Friday night who scaled the 10-foot brick wall of a Yellowstone
County jail's small recreation yard and cut through the chain-link
screen that covered it.
   Fitzpatrick and federal prisoner Kevin Devereaux of Poplar were
spotted by Billings residents around 9 a.m. and surrendered to
police without resistance.
   ``No struggle, no shots fired, nobody hurt,'' said police Sgt.
Rich St. John.
   Fitzpatrick, 47, spent almost 14 years on death row until
federal courts overturned his death sentence for kidnapping and
murdering an 18-year-old grocery store clerk during a robbery in
Hardin in 1975.
   Fitzpatrick pleaded guilty last week to the kidnapping and
murder, but continued to proclaim his innocence while accepting the
plea bargain designed to thwart the death sentence. Judge G. Todd
Baugh set no sentencing date.
   He had been brought to Billings from the state prison in Deer
Lodge for the plea hearing.
   The other six jail escapees were all awaiting trial.
   Devereaux was in custody on federal charges of burglary and
distribution of a controlled substance.
   Another escapee, Cecil Thornell, 40, was captured about 10:30
p.m. Friday, less than an hour after the escape was discovered, St.
John said. He had been charged with robbing a gasoline station
while on parole for armed robbery.
   The escapees still at large Saturday were Frank Belmarez, 22, of
Billings, charged with homicide and aggravated assault in the
stabbing death of his girlfriend outside a bar last October; Daniel
Wilson, 27, of Laurel, charged with suspicion of drug possession
and criminal endangerment; Tony Howland, 24, of Billings, charged
with probation violation for felony theft and possession of a
weapon by a prisoner; and Elwood Hall, 24, of Brockton, scheduled
for trial on Monday on charges of aggravated sexual abuse.

   Romanians on Saturday held a mass
march to mark the 100th day since the bloody uprising that
overthrew 45 years of Communist dictatorship.
   Thousands of flag-waving people, accompanied by soldiers in
parade uniform, staged an officially sanctioned march through
downtown Bucharest. They passed makeshift, candle-lit shrines along
the streets and in squares marking spots where some of the fiercest
fighting took place.
   The march started at a cathedral in front of Parliament, where
services were held. President Ion Iliescu and Premier Petre Roman
were there to join worshipers.
   After leaving the prayer services, some marchers walked to
Heroes Cemetery at the outskirts of the capital, where several
hundred people killed in the fierce street battles between
pro-democracy demonstrators and security agents are buried.
   Another group rallied in front of the television building that
was a focal point of much of the fighting.
   ``December 22 remains what it is ... the day on which the
abolition of the dictatorship was proclaimed and when democracy was
installed,'' said an editorial on the front page of Saturday's
edition of the Tineretul Liber daily newspaper.
   Large-scale demonstrations against the regime of former dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu first broke out in the western city of Timisoara
on Dec. 16, but soon spread to other parts of the country.
   On Dec. 22, 1989, Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled the
capital where street fighting had broken out between secret police
loyal to his regime and the army, which sided with hundreds of
thousands of demonstrators demanding an end to four decades of
Communist rule.
   Ceausescu and his wife were quickly apprehended and later
executed on Dec. 25.
   ``We must never again allow any egotistic individual ...
thirsting for power to shunt the people aside and to make us
enemies of each other,'' a commentary in the influential Adevarul
newspaper declared. ``The martyrs ask us not only to think of them
but also to learn from them.''
   More than 60 parties, political associations and movements have
been established since December.
   The country is currently led by a provisional government headed
by the National Salvation Front.
   Saturday, three of Romania's leading opposition parties
announced they were forming an alliance to compete with the Front
in the upcoming May 20 national elections.
   Opposition parties have repeatedly condemned leaders of the
Front for harboring pro-Commumist sentiments and for supporting a
mixed economy with a preponderance of state-owned enterprises.
   Radu Campeanu, president of the centrist National Liberal Party,
said the alliance would include his party as well as the Social
Democrats and the National Peasants party.
   In its Saturday editorial Tineretul Liber said that ``the way to
the ballot boxes should run next to the Heroes cemetry and
everybody (at the coming) elections should pass through it.''

   Country music singer Suzy Bogguss says
she was bewildered at first by ``Roger &amp; Me'' because she had been
misinformed about the subject of the documentary-style movie.
   ``For the first 20 minutes of the movie,'' said Bogguss, ``I was
trying to figure out how this had anything to do with Gene Siskel
and Roger Ebert.''
   ``Roger &amp; Me'' is not about the two TV film critics, but the
demise of a General Motors Corp. plant in Flint, Mich., and the
Roger of the title refers to GM Chairman Roger Smith.
   A year ago, Bogguss was voted most promising female singer by
the Academy of Country Music. Her hit records include ``I Don't
Want to Set the World on Fire.''

   It was going to be different here.
   Here, in the United States, far from the poverty of their native
Honduras, they would become part of the American Dream.
   In a strange and sometimes hostile city, they clung to their own
kind _ especially when it came time to party.
   Often, they went to Happy Land, an illegal Bronx social club.
There, a week ago, an arson fire consumed the dream and the lives
of 87 people.

   Pedro and Elida Alvarez decided in 1986 that life in Honduras no
longer was tolerable. They would emigrate first to the United
States, bringing their family with them as soon as they could.
   They traveled first to Los Angeles. ``But I didn't want to live
there. I already had relatives here and I wanted to be near my
family,'' Mrs. Alvarez said. They moved to New York, and by 1988,
they had saved enough money to begin the process of reuniting their
family.
   ``We all came here looking for a good job, to better ourselves,
our future,'' Alvarez said. ``That's what we all thought. We'd come
here and start a good life.''
   Denny, who had dropped out of a teacher education program in
Honduras, would come first. He would continue his studies here,
Mrs. Alvarez hoped.
   But when he arrived in March 1988, Denny had other ideas.
   ``When he got here, he didn't want to study,'' Mrs. Alvarez said.
   ``I would tell him not to go out at night but he would go,''
Alvarez sadly remembered last week. ``As a son, he was a good son.
But he would say he was young and he had his own life.''
   Last October, something happened that horrified the Alvarez
family. Denny got into a fight at Happy Land and was cut in the
abdomen. Doctors stitched him up, and he spent three days in the
hospital.
   In the aftermath of that incident, Denny's life became more
tranquil. Three months ago, he married a Honduran woman he met
here. He and Doralina were expecting a child in about three months.
He recently quit his job at a filter company and went to work in a
candy factory.
   On Saturday, he dropped by his parents' house and gave his
mother a box of candy from his new job. He then drove his mother to
a friend's house.
   From there, everyone thought Denny was headed for a private
party in the Bronx. But instead, Denny went to Happy Land.
   ``He liked the ambience. It was there that he could be with his
friends,'' said cousin Hector Martinez, who had stopped going to
Happy Land.
   ``You see,'' said Martinez, ``Denny was always happy. He was
very outgoing.''

   They were the hope of the Gamoneda family.
   The two younger Gamoneda brothers, Marco and Lenny, were serious
students, aware that education was the ticket to escape the poverty
that had followed them from Honduras to the South Bronx.
   ``I don't just say this because they were my brothers, but these
kids were perfect,'' an elder brother, Miguel, said as he prepared
to fly with the bodies back to Honduras where they would be buried.
   ``They didn't smoke, they didn't drink. They never went out. And
that night, they went just to see what it was like,'' Miguel said.
   The brothers had saved enough from their part-time jobs at a
supermarket to buy a Nintendo computer game set.
   ``They'd stay up until 1 a.m. playing the Nintendo instead of
going out. They would rather stay home,'' their older brother said.
   The boys' parents _ Francisco and Leticia _ came to the United
States in 1983 and were able to bring their sons to New York two
years later.
   ``The life here is clearly better and you live well,'' said
Miguel, who works for the city of White Plains, just north of New
York.
   Marco, 23, was attending Bronx Community College and Lenny, 17,
went to Theodore Roosevelt High School.
   ``He was a shy student but he was very bright,'' said Arcadia
Ruiz, one of Marco's instructors.
   Marco told her he wanted to be a automotive mechanic but later,
as his studies progressed, he changed his mind, saying he would
like to be an electrical engineer.
   ``Marco spoke English and he could also write it very well,''
Miguel said. ``He was going to be the first in the family to make
it here.''
   Lenny, meanwhile, had dreams of being a police officer, said
Miguel.
   The brothers worked weekends at a neighborhood supermarket and
usually got off work at about midnight.
   ``But that night, for some reason, they got off at about 8
p.m.,'' Miguel said. A friend called their home several times;
party at Happy Land, the friend said. So they went.

   For Marvin Doubleday, the American Dream soured very quickly.
   More than 1{ years ago, he decided the only way to better
himself was to come to the United States.
   ``Mother was very sad. She didn't want him to come here,'' said
brother Carlos Casco, 21.
   ``But Marvin knew he couldn't continue to live in Honduras. He
couldn't get a job. He kept hearing that he could find work here,
that there was a lot of money here. So he decided to come here.''
   Doubleday, 22, was determined _ he would gain success before
returning home to Honduras. He planned to work here a few years and
save enough money to open a small store back home.
   ``He wanted to put enough money together and go back home and
start a small business _ nothing big but something that was his,''
said a cousin, Ricardo Discua.
   ``People are dying of hunger back home, so you come here,'' said
another cousin, Jorge Bautista, who has been here 12 years.
   Doubleday learned quickly that life here wasn't necessarily
better.
   ``He didn't like all the drug dealers,'' Bautista said. ``He
complained there were drug dealers everywhere. He also didn't like
the city because of the crime, which keeps getting worse and
worse.''
   Moreover, Doubleday was not saving money. He earned about $200 a
week pumping gas at a Bronx service station, and New York's high
rents ate up his cash. He spoke almost no English, and his
prospects were dim.
   A new plan emerged late last year _ his younger brother, Casco,
would move here, doubling their earning power. When Casco and their
mother came to visit, Doubleday's kid brother was surprised at how
he lived.
   ``Don't misunderstand me. We lived in a very poor house back in
our country. And he lived better than we did in Honduras but I
thought he had a better life (in Honduras) ...,'' Casco said. ``It
wasn't a bad apartment but I thought he lived better than he did.''
   Still, the brothers decided they would ``both work real hard,
earn enough money to put together a business and leave here by
December. We would not stay beyond December.''
   Their mother returned to Honduras in February and the brothers
both worked at the Bronx gasoline station. They even found time to
relax, going to Happy Land a couple of times in the past few weeks.
   Casco worked all day Saturday and didn't feel like going out. By
the time he got home, Doubleday already had left. He and a friend
called Casco, urging him to join them later at Happy Land.
   ``But I was very tired. I ate dinner and went to sleep,'' Casco
said.
   The next morning Casco knew that their American dream had ended.
   ``And now, I will go back to my country and I will bury him,''
he said.

   The car slowed on the rain-slicked Bronx street
as its occupants pointed and stared at the charred building that
once housed the Happy Land Social Club.
   Others stopped off Friday night to add their contribution to a
burgeoning memorial of flowers and funeral wreaths laid out on the
sidewalk.
   Like a peculiar urban pilgrimage, the scene is repeated over and
over as friends and neighbors, mourners and the merely curious come
to see where 87 people died in last Sunday's fire at the illegal
social club.
   Robert Robayo and his wife, Estella, somberly stood in the
drizzle and stared blankly at charred coats that lay unclaimed
behind the flowers.
   ``I can't believe they had so many people in there. It looks so
small,'' Robayo said. ``They should never have had so many people
in there.''
   In the week since the disaster, the city has cracked down on
illegal social clubs, beefing up enforcement by transferring more
than 100 police officers from a special anti-drug squad.
   In raids Thursday night and Friday morning, police found 74 of
89 clubs they visited closed. They served 17 summonses and 36
notices for building and fire code infractions at 15 others.
   At least four illegal clubs in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan did not open this weekend because of the crackdown.
   The four clubs, said a source familiar with their operation who
spoke on condition of anonymity, usually buy just enough liquor for
the weekend but opted not to buy any liquor or to open this weekend.
   A woman stood outside what has become the city's best-known
club, shaking her head as she recalled the numerous times she
danced there. Safety never occurred to her.
   ``You're in there drinking. You're dancing. You're not thinking
about that,'' said the woman, who would identify herself only as
Celeste. ``But now, when I go to other clubs, I'm going to look and
see if they have a rear exit.'' Were it not for the small group of
firefighters and police officers assigned to protect the building,
Happy Land might seem like just another charred building in the
Bronx. The East Tremont section where the building sits is bleak,
with littered, vacant lots next to deteriorated buildings.
   At the Virgin Islands American Bar on East Tremont, a block from
Happy Land, several patrons said they had never previously heard of
the club.
   ``I couldn't even tell if the place was open or not,'' said the
bar's manager, who would identify herself only as Shirley.
   But a woman who visited the building insisted everyone in the
area knew about Happy Land.
   ``How could you not know about it? It was like the only place
you could go to around here and afford,'' said the woman, who would
not give her name.
   ``Some are dropping off flowers. Others just stop and say a
prayer,'' said Fire Marshal Larry Lynch of the steady stream of
visitors.
   One onlooker asked if the neighborhood was returning to normal.
   ``Are you kidding? This place is never normal. This is the
Bronx,'' answered a man who identified himself as Alberto.
   Alberto, who was walking around trying to sell two pairs of used
trousers and slippers, stared across the street at the Happy Land
building.
   ``Look, the drugs are still here. People are still scared to go
out in the street. Some of these young kids are crazy and will
stick you for nothing. No. Nothing's changed here. It's just gone
from bad to worse.''

   Socialist reformer Imre Pozsgay has
withdrawn from a run-off election after his defeat in first-round
voting in his district, the state news agency MTI reported Saturday.
   But since Pozsgay won a seat in parliament through the regional
list of his party in Bacs-Kiskun county, his pullout was mainly
seen as a loss of prestige that may hurt his efforts to become
president.
   In the Sopron district close to the Austrian border, Jozsef
Szajer, a 28-year-old newcomer representing the League of Free
Democrats, placed first with 29.1 percent of the votes, Laszlo
Karpati of the Hungarian Democratic Forum got 19.85 percent and
Pozsgay finished third with 17.97 percent.
   The March 25 balloting was Hungary's first free parliamentary
elections in more than four decades under Communist rule. Pozsgay
was a key reformer in the Socialist Party that emerged from the
Communist Party last October.

<TEXT>
   Voters decide this week whether to restrict
Wisconsin's so-called ``Vanna White veto,'' which has allowed
governors to rewrite legislation by striking letters, words,
punctuation and numerals.
   Foes of the unlimited veto _ nicknamed for the letter-flipping
hostess on the television game show ``Wheel of Fortune'' _ say it
gives legislative power to the executive branch, violating the
constitutional separation of powers.
   ``This dictatorial power is clearly repugnant to the American
constitutional system,'' said Senate President Fred Risser. ``The
intent of the Legislature can be altered or reversed with a flick
of the pen.''
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a first-term Republican, defends his
court-affirmed authority to selectively eliminate letters and is
urging voters to retain it.
   ``I think the people like having a strong governor,'' Thompson
said, adding he's the only person between the 132 lawmakers of a
Democrat-controlled Legislature and their proposals for more
spending and programs.
   Thompson's most famous ``Vanna veto'' was when he reworked a
bill in 1988 that limited the time a juvenile could be held in
detention to 48 hours. The governor boosted the limit to 10 days by
crossing out ``48 hours'' and most of the bill's next four lines,
leaving intact only the word ``day'' and four other strategically
placed letters: ``t-e-n day-s.''
   No attempt was made to override that veto, even though it drew
strong objections from legislators. The governor said later he made
a mistake in that case, at the request of a couple of Democratic
legislators, and quipped: ``I followed the Democrats' advice and it
got me in trouble.'' But he has stuck to the concept of creative
vetoing.
   In another instance, Thompson used his pen to convert the
Legislature's 1 percent reduction in welfare spending to 6 percent.
   Thompson's aides say he has corrected language that would not
have withstood legal challenges and inserted needed language, such
as definition of terms, that was omitted inadvertently by
legislators.
   But the governor's record 290 partial vetoes in the 1987-89
state budget _ many of which changed appropriations bills by
striking numbers and letters or merging words _ so angered
Democrats that they sued Thompson.
   In 1988, they lost in the state Supreme Court, which cited the
1930 provision in the state constitution giving the governor the
right to veto any appropriation bill ``in part.'' In its 4-3
ruling, the court interpreted ``in part'' to mean any part,
including lines, paragraphs, numerals, letters and words.
   Their latest counterattack offers voters in Tuesday's spring
election a constitutional amendment that would bar the governor
from using his veto to strike letters and words to change the
meaning of legislation. The governor could still strike numerals or
entire sentences.
   In Wisconsin, a constitutional amendment must be passed by two
consecutive sessions of the Legislature and then by voters in a
statewide referendum.
   Rep. David Prosser, the GOP minority leader in the Assembly,
tried unsuccessfully to sidetrack the amendment in the Legislature.
He contends the governor needs the authority to correct legislative
mistakes.
   Prosser claims the furor over the governor's use of the veto is
overblown because the Legislature has the right to restore bills to
their original form by overriding a veto with a two-thirds vote of
both houses.
   Democrats control the Senate 19-14 and the Assembly 55-42, but
often they cannot muster enough votes among Republicans to override
Thompson.
   Still, no lawmaker has seriously suggested that the partial veto
power be repealed, just tamed.
   The issue has created friction between the legislative and
executive branches since the 1970s, when Gov. Patrick J. Lucey, a
Democrat, cut a single digit from a $25 million appropriation,
reducing it to $5 million.
   His successors gradually expanded the partial veto authority.
   Acting Gov. Martin J. Schreiber, a Democrat, reversed the intent
of the Legislature on a $1 contribution by taxpayers for a campaign
fund to simply checking off $1 of their taxes for the refund.
   Another Democrat, Gov. Anthony S. Earl, started the selective
elimination of letters and digits from appropriations bills.

   A man who persuaded co-workers to

authorities said.
   Eugene Gergler, 68, of Cincinnati collapsed Friday night in the
parking lot on Goat Island, between the American and Horseshoe
Falls, and was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later,
said state park police Officer Patrick Moriarty.
   Gergler and three other electricians had been working in Erie,
Pa., earlier Friday when he told them his lifelong dream was to see
the falls, Moriarty said. So the four drove 120 miles to Niagara
Falls.
   He said Gergler complained of feeling ill while taking pictures
of the falls and went back to the group's truck, where his
companions found him unconscious.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the criminal trial of John
Poindexter tried to make it appear the former national security
adviser was immersed in a pattern of deception that kept even his
own boss, Ronald Reagan, in the dark.
   But defense attorneys suggested that Poindexter himself was
uninformed about onetime White House aide Oliver North's activities
on behalf of the Contras and the sale of arms to Iran. They
questioned the accuracy of an FBI agent's testimony and elicited
testimony from witnesses who swore there was never any discussion
of covering up.
   Poindexter, who didn't testify, is on trial in U.S. District
Court in Washington on charges that he lied to members of Congress
about his involvement in selling arms to Iran and funneling
proceeds to help Nicaraguan rebels when Congress had banned such
aid.
   The arms sales supposedly were intended to make it possible to
release American hostages held in the Middle East, even though the
official policy was not to negotiate with terrorists.
   District Judge Harold Greene was scheduled to instruct the jury
Monday, after which deliberations will begin.
   During the trial, which began March 5, prosecutors contended
Poindexter withheld the truth from Reagan about the diversion of
arms sale money to the Contras.
   According to a defense witness who took notes at a meeting on
Oct. 7, 1986, between Poindexter and Reagan, Poindexter told the
president there was no U.S. government connection to a downed
aircraft in Nicaragua.
   The plane, shot down two days before, carried crewman Eugene
Hasenfus, who was part of North's resupply effort to the Contra
rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   Poindexter's lawyers brought up the meeting as part of the
effort to show that North ran the operation without the knowledge
of his immediate boss, Poindexter. But prosecutor Dan K. Webb
suggested Poindexter knew Hasenfus was a pilot with the supply
effort just as Poindexter was fully informed of the previous
arms-for-hostages effort.
   North has already been convicted for his role in the affair.
   Poindexter is accused only of falsely telling Congress on Nov.
21, 1986, that he hadn't known until January of that year that U.S.
Hawk missiles were airlifted to Iran late in the previous year.
   Prosecutors presented evidence of Poindexter's involvement in
the November 1985 missile shipment, including:
   _Computer messages from North discussing the impending delivery
of the Hawks. Poindexter's lawyers point out there is no evidence
that he read the messages.
   _CIA employee Norman Gardner's statements to the FBI in 1987
that CIA cable traffic showed the operation was being directed on
instructions from Poindexter. At Poindexter's trial, Gardner said
he didn't recall telling that to the FBI.
   On Nov. 28, 1986, Poindexter had told the FBI ``he had no
working knowledge'' of 1985 arms shipments to Iran, an FBI agent
testified. Poindexter's lawyers countered by pointing out that the
FBI agent had taken no notes during the 15-minute interview. She
wrote down notes on her way back to the office.
   _Poindexter contacted the Pentagon to line up replacement Hawks
for the ones Israel was preparing to send Iran on behalf of the
United States.
   _Poindexter received a Nov. 26, 1985, note from CIA Director
Casey telling him to keep an attached draft of a presidential
document secret. The presidential document allowed the CIA to help
with the missile shipment the day before.
   Such a document, known as a ``finding'' was signed by the
president the next month. In a speech late the next year, Nov. 13,
1986, Reagan said the United States had not sold arms to win
release of the hostages.
   On Nov. 21, 1986, Poindexter told Congress that he hadn't known
until the previous day that some U.S. officials might have known
before the delivery that Hawks were aboard an aircraft.
   Casey told Congress the same day he understood CIA officers
didn't know Hawk missiles were aboard the aircraft ``until the
Iranians told them some time in January'' 1986. The airplane's
crew, Casey testified, had been told the cargo was spare parts for
the oil drilling fields in Tehran.
   Hours after briefing Congress, Poindexter tore up the
politically embarrassing presidential document.
   CIA aide Gardner said he sat in on Poindexter's briefings of
congressmen after ``Casey told me to go to the White House.'' After
Casey finished testifying before the Senate intelligence committee,
Gardner reported Casey's testimony back to Poindexter at the White
House.
   Was Gardner there ``to make sure Admiral Poindexter and Casey
were saying the same things to Congress?'' inquired Iran-Contra
prosecutor Christian Mixter.
   No, replied Gardner, who stiffly denied Casey and Poindexter
were feeding Congress a cover story.
   ``Did you tell Admiral Poindexter that the cover story wasn't
holding up very well?'' asked Mixter.
   ``No, I didn't,'' replied Gardner.
   Poindexter's defense is that at the time he briefed Congress, he
had only a vague recollection of the year-earlier shipment to Iran.
Poindexter offered to gather details and get back to the
congressmen, his lawyers emphasized in questioning witnesses who
attended the meetings.

   Republicans have a hard time winning anything in
Hawaii, even a cockroach race.
   Undaunted by two previous defeats, President Bush is hoping a
kinder, gentler cockroach will reverse his fortunes in the Iolani
School's annual roach race.
   The White House has lost in the past with entries named the
``Yellow Roach of Texas'' and ``Oval Office Roach,'' but Bush has
high hopes for a bug named ``Kinder Gentleroach.''
   Bush figures if the slogan was good enough to beat Michael
Dukakis, it should be good enough to win the April 20 race.
   ``I know a lot of thoroughbred roach lovers were disappointed
that Oval Office Roach did so badly back in 1988, but lots has
happened since then,'' Bush wrote in a letter to roach race founder
Kimo McVay.
   Bush challenged the other competitors to submit their roaches to
tests for illegal chemicals, saying he would submit his roach ``to
an anti-steroid test, saliva test, etc., and I challenge all other
roach owners to do the same.''
   The president also joked about the entry of race commissioner
William Conrad, of TV's ``Jake and the Fatman'' fame, saying
Conrad's roach would not win because it's overweight.
   Money from the event goes to help fight multiple sclerosis, a
disease of the central nervous system that afflicts an estimated
250,000 Americans.

<HEAD>Lithuanians, Estonians on Different Routes to Independence</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flexing its military muscle, the Kremlin blusters
at Lithuania's leaders for boldly declaring independence. Yet it
hardly uttered a critical word when Estonia issued a cautious
statement of similar intent.
   The two republics, forcibly annexed by Moscow in 1940 with the
third Baltic state of Latvia, are treading very different paths in
their quest for secession.
   Lithuanians demand recognition now and want to work out the
details later. Estonians want to know exactly what they're getting
into.
   Watching and waiting are Latvia, Georgia, Moldavia and other
Soviet republics where yearnings to leave the Soviet Union are also
strong.
   On Friday, when Soviet soldiers were seizing the Lithuanian
prosecutor's office in an effort to impose Moscow's man, Estonia's
legislature was declaring the Soviets occupiers and setting off on
the road to restored sovereignty.
   The reaction of Moscow has been as different as the tactical
divergence in the Baltic independence movement that surfaced in
1988.
   Soviet military officials accuse Lithuania's leaders of plotting
to jail opponents of secession and of encouraging Lithuanians to
desert the Red Army. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has accused
them of pursuing a ``ruinous'' road.
   In contrast, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda on Saturday
noted that ``even Estonian radicals say: first negotiations and
then a political decision.''
   The three Baltic states snatched independence from the ruins of
the Russian Empire at the end of World War I, were forcibly
absorbed back into the Soviet Union in 1940 and spent most of World
War II under Nazi occupation.
   Thousands of Baltic people were then exiled to Siberia or killed
by Stalin as alleged Nazi collaborators or enemies of Soviet power.
Armed resistance to Soviet rule lasted well into the 1950s in
Lithuanian forests.
   Latvia is moving more slowly than its neighbors because its
population is only about half ethnic Latvian, but Lithuanian and
Estonian leaders say they hope it also will make a first formal
move toward independence. Despite tactical differences, activists
from the three republics cooperate closely.
   Lithuania's premier, Kazimiera Prunskiene, called Estonia's move
Friday a ``show of support'' for her republic but said she did not
know whether it would help or hurt.
   President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania said: ``Estonia has
chosen a different legal formula and a different path toward its
independence, but the essence is the same.''
   The March 11 declaration of independence by Lithuania's
Parliament was a hasty move aimed at pre-empting Gorbachev from
using newly expanded presidential powers to dissolve their
Parliament or impose direct Kremlin rule. But immediately after the
declaration, nothing really changed. Lithuanians still used Soviet
money and still were working in factories tied by contract and
supply to the Soviet economy.
   The legislature elected last month then began removing the
trappings of Soviet rule, named Cabinet ministers and began
developing its own body of laws.
   Moscow cracked down. Soviet troops raided hospitals to seize
Lithuanians who, asserting their claim to be foreign citizens,
deserted the Red Army. Kremlin forces also took over several
Communist Party buildings.
   After failing Friday to get employees of the prosecutor's office
in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius to accept a new chief
appointed by Moscow, Soviet officials sent soldiers to occupy the
office.
   Efforts to disarm the population and halt a Lithuanian campaign
to sign up volunteers for duty as borders guards were less
effective.
   It is just those kinds of disputes the Estonians say they want
to avoid.
   In its declaration Friday, the Estonian Parliament said full
independence would be established only after Estonia creates its
own institutions and works out how to divide property between the
republic and the Soviet Union.
   The length of the transition period is to be set this week.
   Compared with Lithuania's rush for political high ground,
Estonia seems unconcerned about the possibility of Gorbachev
slamming the door before it can escape the Soviet Union.
   The republic's leaders say there is no point in declaring
independence because Estonia has been independent _ though occupied
_ all along.
   Official Soviet communications about Estonia's future seem to
carry an air of resignation. Tass, the official Soviet news agency,
said the ``broad aspiration to restore Estonian statehood is in
evidence'' and that political parties that want to pursue it appear
to have the upper hand.
   Ethnic Lithuanians comprise about 80 percent of their republic's
3.8 million people. By contrast, ethnic Estonians make up just 60
percent of their republic's 1.6 million people and must thus move
more cautiously. They lack the two-thirds majority needed for
independence if it were put to a referendum.
   The population split also has given non-Estonians a greater
share of the Supreme Soviet's 105 seats. But as Friday's 75-0 vote
showed, they do not have enough to stop the legislature from moving
toward independence.
   Pravda's commentary Saturday praised Estonian Communist Party
leader Vaino Vyalyas, an old chum of Gorbachev's from the Komsomol
Communist Youth League, for keeping Estonia under control.
   Vyalyas, it said, is a ``man with great political experience, a
professional diplomat, who is familiar with the fine art of
compromise, thanks to which in the last year and a half the
republic has managed to smooth over many difficult problems.''

   Robert Palmisciano bet $2 at a greyhound
track and won $39,319, but had to wait more than five years for the
payoff.
   A state Superior Court jury ruled in his favor Friday in a
lawsuit against Lincoln Greyhound Park.
   Palmisciano placed his bet on a twin trifecta, meaning he had to
pick the win, place and show dogs in two races, at a meet on Dec.
10, 1984.
   After getting the 9th race right, he went to a teller to choose
three more dogs for the 11th race. But after making his selection,
he changed his mind and told the teller he wanted to bet on three
other dogs.
   The teller started to give him another ticket, but the machine
jammed. Before a maintenance man could fix it, the 11th race had
started.
   The dogs again came in as Palmisciano predicted, but the
racetrack refused to pay him a $39,319 jackpot because he didn't
have a ticket.
   Palmisciano claimed Autotote Limited, which operates the tote
machines at the track, was negligent for failing to have additional
service personnel while the race program was under way.
   He also claimed that track officials did not comply with its
obligation under an implied betting contract between him and
Lincoln Greyhound Park.
   His attorney, John D. Archetto, said the jury award plus
interest is expected to exceed $60,000.

<HEAD>Germans Visit Mass Grave Near Former Soviet Camp</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORANIENBURG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter Weigel has no plans to
visit the mass grave on the edge of town that has drawn the eerie
fascination of so many of his neighbors.
   ``I am certain I knew some of the people buried there,'' said
the native of Oranienburg, 20 miles north of Berlin.
   Weigel, 62, spent four years after World War II in a nearby
Soviet-run internment camp. He said he believes the camp supplied
the hundreds of bodies packed together in the nearby forest.
   ``There were youngsters in the camp here, not just soldiers. I
was 17, a worker, not a soldier,'' he said Saturday. ``They gave us
only bread to eat. Two hundred and fifty men in one barracks.''
   Weigel said many of his fellow inmates were taken from the camp
and never returned. ``We knew what happened to them,'' he said,
staring down the road that leads to the forest.
   A steady stream of visitors filtered through the forest on the
outskirts of town on Saturday, standing in the clearing and staring
at the dozens of holes dug by authorities, then refilled with loose
dirt.
   ``My parents told me this had happened. But nobody really talked
about it. Now we can see it,'' said Luther Walz, an Oranienburg
resident who trekked into the forest with his wife and son.
   Last week officials began digging in the woods after a resident
said that as a young boy he watched Soviet troops gun down hundreds
of German prisoners soon after the end of the war.
   The skeletal remains of between 200 and 1,000 people were
unearthed during the excavations.
   Oranienburg authorities said they could not identify the dead,
but presumed they were German inmates of the camp that they said
was run by Stalin's fearsome secret police.
   West German officials have said about 70,000 Germans were
executed by Stalin's occupation troops in the years following the
war. Many of the Soviet internment camps were former Nazi death
camps.
   The discovery of the remains has triggered considerable interest
in both West Germany and East Germany, but little attention in
other parts of the world, where the deaths of 6 million Jews at the
hands of the Nazis dwarfs all other atrocities of the war.
   In this village, however, the grave site has provoked
fascination.
   The 300-yard gravesite is blocked-off by a thin white rope
draped with small red-and-white flags. ``Mass grave of unknown
victims. Entry forbidden,'' says the widely ignored sign at the end
of the clearing.
   Nearby, a new wooden cross with the name ``Adolf Lopoehn'' had
been stuck in the ground. It identified Lopoehn as a singer from
the nearby town of Sachsenhausen.
   ``There were children there,'' said Gertrude Erdmann, 76.
   ``They are Nazis,'' said an elderly man who refused to give his
name.

<HEAD>All Three Northwest Crewmen Drop Requests For Speedy Hearings on
License Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three Northwest Airlines cockpit crew
members whose licenses were revoked for allegedly flying under the
influence of alcohol have dropped requests for expedited hearings
to contest the revocations.
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Friday canceled
hearings set to begin Tuesday in St. Paul on the March 8 Northwest
flight from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis in which the three men were
involved.
   The NTSB received letters from attorneys for copilot Robert
Kirchner of Highland Ranch, Colo., and flight engineer Joseph
Balzer of Antioch, Tenn., saying they waived rights to expedited
hearings.
   The letters asked that the cases go to the board's non-emergency
calendar, which means that the appeals will be heard within the
year. A few days earlier, Capt. Norman Prouse of Conyers, Ga.,
waived his right to an expedited hearing.
   The Federal Aviation Administration revoked the licenses March 9
after the three were accused of flying a Northwest jet carrying 91
passengers while intoxicated. The three appealed.
   The crew members, who have been fired by Northwest, were charged
last week by federal authorities with flying under the influence of
alcohol. The case is to go before a grand jury.
   Mark McDermott, an attorney for Kirchner, said Friday that he
wants to focus on the felony case.
   ``The criminal charges are quite serious and carry serious
penalties,'' he said. ``The pilot's license cases have to take a
back seat, temporarily.''
   According to an FBI affidavit, Kirchner and Balzer shared about
seven pitchers of beer at a bar in Moorhead the night before their
flight, while Prouse allegedly had about 19 mixed drinks.
   Attorneys for Kirchner and Balzer have denied that their clients
were drunk or impaired during the flight.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
Lithuanians on Saturday that Moscow would not negotiate with them
until they annul their declaration of independence, warning of
``grave consequences'' if they refuse.
   In Vilnius, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis dismissed
the appeal, telling reporters the Soviet leader was ``demanding
impossible things.''
   In a toughly worded, 18-line statement issued in Moscow and
addressed to the republic's Parliament, Gorbachev charged
Lithuanian leaders with ``openly challenging and insulting'' the
Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev said Lithuania had chosen a ``ruinous'' path that
``will only lead to a dead end.''
   It was his first formal statement on the issue since March 11,
when the Baltic state's Parliament sparked open confrontation with
the Kremlin by voting to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev said he was proposing that Lithuania's Parliament
``immediately annul the illegal acts it has adopted. Such a step
will open the possibility for discussing the entire range of
problems on the solely acceptable basis: within the framework of
the U.S.S.R. Constitution.''
   In a separate three-page statement, also carried by the official
Tass news agency and read by an announcer on national television
news Saturday night, Gorbachev addressed the people of Lithuania
directly.
   He warned that ``irresponsible and illegal actions'' by
Lithuanian leaders could affect the republic's economic,
scientific, technical and other links with Soviet republics, which
supply the Baltic state with much of its oil, gas and other
essential products.
   In Vilnius, uniformed men were reported patrolling the printing
plant for republic's main newspapers and the chief prosecutor's
office. Both buildings were seized during the night in Moscow's
latest move to assert control.
   The Lithuanians have not budged and Landsbergis said they would
press on with their independence drive:
   ``We have no sources for stopping this. We can work, live
normally and wait. We must be tough and have tenacity. We have this
in our character.''
   In an attempt to pressure Lithuania to back down, Soviet troops
have occupied Communist Party buildings, paraded tanks through the
streets, demanded that residents hand over firearms and arrested
Lithuanian deserters from the Red Army.
   Gorbachev said the Kremlin was receiving many letters and
telegrams from citizens demanding that the Soviet government uphold
the constitution in its showdown with Lithuania.
   ``The situation in the republic and around it has become
dramatic. If you would not hear the voice of the reason now, the
developments may have grave consequences for all of us. We must be
united in our desire to prevent that.''
   Lithuania's deputy premier Romualdas Ozolas said Gorbachev's
appeal was ``strong. It's a step we must overcome.'' He suggested
Lithuanians write to the Kremlin to express their desire for
independence.
   Gorbachev acted after his newly created Cabinet directed him
Friday to tell Lithuania that it must rescind unconstitutional laws
before any talks on secession could begin. The constitution
stipulates a republic's right to secede but offers no mechanism for
secession.
   Gorbachev has promised Lithuania and other independence-minded
republics that such a mechanism will be established, but the
measure currently before the Soviet legislature gives the Kremlin
final authority on such questions.
   On Friday, nearby Estonia pledged to join Lithuania in its drive
to regain independence lost when the Soviet Union forcibly annexed
them with Latvia, the third Baltic republic. Latvia is expected to
pursue independence next month.
   In Moscow earlier Saturday, about 700 people rallied in Gorky
Park in support of Lithuania, carrying signs that read: ``Hands off
Lithuania,'' and ``Down with Red Fascism.''
   Official Soviet sources estimate about 250 Lithuanians have
deserted the Red Army since the republic declared independence, but
Lithuanians say as many as 900 have left their units.
   The Soviet military's deputy commander in Lithuania, N.
Rogachev, told Tass Saturday that Lithuanian deserters were
beginning to trickle back to barracks. The military rounded up at
least 23 deserters on Tuesday, beating some bloody, and promised to
seek out others who do not turn themselves in.
   ``Sooner or later the law will be put into force,'' Rogachev
warned. ``And the consequences for the fates of the young people
may be most tragic.''
   The Defense Ministry had said it would not punish Lithuanian
deserters if they voluntarily returned.
   But Chief Military Prosecutor Alexander Katusev said in a later
interview on Soviet TV that criminal proceedings had been started
against all deserters and added that people encouraging desertions
also would be prosecuted.
   Vilius Kavalauskas, a journalist for the Lithuanian newspaper
Tiesa, said 30 soldiers were patrolling the prosecutor's office and
another 15 armed with nightsticks were at the central newspaper
printing plant.
   Lithuanian journalists said soldiers had not tried to interfere
with printing of weekend papers.
   The prosecutor's office was seized Friday after staff members
refused to work with a Moscow loyalist named by the Kremlin.
   A duty officer at the Lithuanian Interior Ministry said soldiers
also had occupied another Communist Party building, the Institute
of Party History. Communist Party Buildings already under military
control include the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, the Higher Party
School and Communist Party headquarters.
   Soviet authorities have said the troop actions were legitimate
attempts to enforce law and order in a Soviet republic that has no
right to unilaterally declare independence.

   Nomination of a onetime drug user as the
nation's top savings and loan regulator demonstrates President
Bush's unwillingness to adopt past drug usage as a litmus test for
officials in his administration, officials said Saturday.
   ``These matters are always considered on a case by case basis,''
one White House official said Saturday when asked about nominee T.
Timothy Ryan's admission that he had used cocaine and marijuana on
occasion in the early 1970s.
   The president himself has said past indiscretions with drugs
should not disqualify someone from government service.
   ``In my view, (if) somebody used marijuana sometime ago and is
not into anything of that nature, why, no, I don't think that
should be held against them,'' he said when asked in mid-March
about campaign reports regarding Texas State Treasurer Ann
Richards' refusal to say whether she had ever used illegal
narcotics. The gubernatorial candidate has admitted to being a
recovering alcoholic.
   Ryan, Bush's embattled nominee to be director of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, won narrow endorsement
Friday from the Senate Banking Committee despite the disclosure of
drug use.
   The committee members had access to FBI background reports in
which Ryan admitted the drug use, but the matter was never raised
during the committee's hearings despite considerable opposition to
his appointment.
   One Banking Committee member, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., knew
about the drug use on the part of Ryan prior to the vote, said aide
Ken Klein. But Klein said Graham's ``primary interest was
qualifications,'' indicating that the senator didn't think Ryan had
the necessary experience.
   Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., who also opposed
Ryan, released a statement saying ``FBI files should be treated
with the strictest confidentiality. I will not comment on any
nominee's file. I consider any disclosures from such files to be
highly improper.''
   The drug information was disclosed in an NBC-TV report Friday
night, and later confirmed by administration officials.
   Officials expressed support for Ryan after the disclosure,
stressing the administration had known the information all along.
   ``We knew about it before hand. We felt it was not relevant. We
felt he was the best candidate,'' White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said Saturday.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady emphasized in a statement
Friday that Ryan had volunteered the information.
   ``The incidents were limited and a long time ago,'' Brady said.
``We believe Mr. Ryan is well qualified and his nomination deserves
the Senate's full support.''
   If confirmed by the Senate, the 44-year-old Ryan would not be
alone as a former drug user in the Bush administration, said
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   One said it would be safe to say ``there are hundreds of
officials throughout the administration who have admitted'' to drug
use in their security clearance process.
   Another senior official said ``it would be impossible to
conceive'' there are not numerous individuals who, like Ryan,
experimented with drugs in the 1970s when many considered marijuana
use and even cocaine more benign than in today's anti-drug climate.
   ``Everybody's off that stuff now,'' said a third official. ``But
broadly speaking, everybody used the stuff in the 70s.'' The Bush
administration is aware of that usage because ``nobody wants to lie
to the FBI,'' the source added.
   The seriousness of the drug use, the type of drugs used and how
long ago it occurred are factors to be considered when looking at
how much to weigh past drug abuse against a potential nominee's
record, officials said.
   Even some diehard conservatives in Washington political circles
do not see drug use as a flat disqualifier for public office.
   Gary Bauer, who served as domestic policy adviser under
President Reagan and now heads the conservative Family Research
Council, said Saturday that ``there's a statute of limitations on
every indiscretion. As serious as drug use is, I'd being willing to
concede that 20 years is a good statute of limitations.''
   However, he said Ryan, as a condition of his confirmation,
should pledge to devote a specific number of hours a week ``to talk
to young people about the foolishness of what he did and how it
almost ruined his life.''
   To do otherwise would send a message of hypocrisy to children,
Bauer said.
   ``We are spending billions of dollars on this problem. We
shouldn't be telling our kids `don't,' and then appointing
officials to high government positions,'' unless they take on the
anti-drug education task he suggests, Bauer said.
   In 1987, during the Reagan administration, Douglas Ginsburg
withdrew as a nominee to the Supreme Court after admitting he had
smoked marijuana while a law professor. William Bennett, then the
education secretary and now Bush's drug policy director, helped
persuade Ginsburg to withdraw.
   But politicians appear more willing to count on public
understanding of their past drug use _ at least in cases that did
not amount to a prolonged period of serious abuse.
   During the early days prior to the 1988 presidential campaign,
Democratic contenders Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona governor,
and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, both admitted they had
smoked marijuana while in college.
   Bush said he had never tried illegal drugs himself, but added at
that time, ``but I'd hate to speak for my kids.''
   Bush's five children range in age from 30 to 43.

   Abortion foes quickly targeted Democratic
Gov. Cecil Andrus for defeat in his try for an unprecedented fourth
term, saying he betrayed his own beliefs by vetoing what would have
been the nation's most restrictive state abortion law.
   ``This veto will galvanize the pro-life majority in Idaho and
nationwide,'' said National Right to Life President John Willke,
maintaining Andrus has forfeited any claim to an anti-abortion
stand.
   ``We will be heard at the polls,'' vowed Kerry Uhlenkott of
Idaho Right to Life. ``This has been a long, hard fight, and it is
by no means over.''
   Andrus, acknowledging the political cost of his veto, said he
acted in the best interests of his state. He denied being
influenced by political considerations and threats of economic
retaliation from outsiders.
   Instead, Andrus said, he rejected a bill that many legal experts
said had little chance of being upheld.
   ``I know that of course there will be some fallout, but so be
it,'' Andrus said. ``I can't do anything about that. I have to do
what I think is right.''
   While incurring the wrath of anti-abortion activists, Andrus did
win over pro-choice forces who pledged to support him despite his
belief that abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape,
incest and to save the women's life.
   One of the main architects of the vetoed bill, Rep. Gary
Montgomery, conceded the legislation ``could have been improved and
strengthened.'' He and other abortion foes promised to refine and
reintroduce the bill in 1991.
   The defeated version, based on a National Right to Life
Committee model rejected as too restrictive by other states, called
for outlawing abortion except in cases of non-statutory rape
reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18,
severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or physical health
of the woman.
   The Legislature adjourned its 1990 session a half hour before
the governor's announcement on Friday, precluding the possibility
of even considering an override of the veto.
   ``This is a time for reflection, to solicit the views of our
constituents over the interim period,'' Montgomery said.
   Idaho was the fifth state this year to reject a form of the
national model anti-abortion forces want to use to test the U.S.
Supreme Court's commitment to legalized abortion.
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, called the Andrus veto an ``outstanding victory.''
   ``But we face the reality that for every Cecil Andrus, there
stands a Bob Casey and a Joseph Ada ready to take away the right of
women to choose so our work is not done,'' Michelman said. She
referred to the Pennsylvania and Guam governors who signed
restrictive abortion legislation.
   ``It only takes one piece of anti-choice legislation to be
passed in one state somewhere in this country to threaten all
women's rights,'' she said. ``Until we have pro-choice governors,
pro-choice legislatures, a pro-choice Congress, a pro-choice
president in washington, our job is not done.''
   With some politicians believing the veto has complicated what
would have been easy re-election, the three Republicans competing
for the right to challenge Andrus this fall immediately accused the
governor of waffling on abortion.
   Boise stockbroker Milton Erhart, the lone GOP contender on the
pro-choice side, pointed out that 17 years ago Andrus was the
governor who signed the so-called ``trigger law'' banning abortion
except to save the woman's life and to imprison both women and
doctors involved in illegal abortions if the Supreme Court reversed
its 1973 decision.
   The Legislature repealed that law this year. ``Andrus has again
demonstrated his expert finger-in-the-wind approach to politics,''
Erhart said.
   Former state Sen. Roger Fairchild said Andrus should win an
Olympic gold medal in the flip-flop, and state Sen. Rachel Gilbert,
considered the front-runner for the nomination, said Andrus ``went
south on his principles.''
   Andrus, insisting he remains opposed to abortion, maintained the
majority of Idahoans would agree with his decision.
   ``Every political career has to come to an end sometime,'' he
said. ``I'd hate for that to be the issue. But if it is, so be it.''

<HEAD>Indiana Deals With Patchwork of Time Zones</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `Seventy-six of...', to CORRECT that reference

<TEXT>
   In Indiana, where time zones can divide a
town, many people keep two reckonings of the hour to cope with
living in a ``time warp.''
   Hoosiers say the state's three time zones wreak havoc on
business and family life. At no time does the entire state follow
the same clock, creating timekeeping headaches from urban centers
to country hamlets.
   People live in one zone and work in another, children cross time
lines to and from school, prime time programming for televison is
complicated and meetings can be disrupted by delays, latecomers and
no-shows.
   One of three states exempted from the national time change _ the
others are Hawaii and Arizona _ Indiana is the only one with
fragmented zones. A large portion is permanently on Eastern
Standard Time, while the rest observes either Central time or
Eastern time and changes twice a year like the other 47 states.
   ``Indiana has the most complex time observance of any place in
the United States,'' said Joanne Petrie, an attorney for the U.S.
Department of Transportation, the agency in charge of setting time
zones.
   Mayor John Ford of Union City, which is divided down the middle
by the Indiana-Ohio line, calls Sunday's change to daylight-saving
time a ``time warp.''
   He said most residents of the portion of Union City in Indiana
will experience the anxiety of being an hour late for something as
those on the Ohio side of the line spring ahead. ``But they'll make
it up by being an hour early for something else,'' he said.
   ``The majority of people live the way it suits them, and in a
lot of places that involves keeping two different times in the same
househould,'' he said.
   Seventy-six of Indiana's 92 counties _ including Randolph
County, in which Union City, Ind., is located _ remain on Eastern
Standard Time as everyone else resets their clocks on Sunday.
   Eleven other counties observe Central time and, on schedule,
switch from CST to CDT as of Sunday _ meaning that for the next
five months, their clocks will look just like the EST counties'
clocks. Five other counties that are close to Louisville or
Cincinnati traditionally observe Eastern time to remain in step
with those cities, switching as of Sunday to EDT.
   Indiana's time zones are a compromise following years of local
and national debate. Officials say it's probably the best that can
be expected, though far from perfect.
   Prior to 1961, the Indiana-Ohio line also divided the Central
and Eastern time zones. The line was later shifted to bisect the
state and then re-shifted to create current time boundaries.
   ``There's some sort of truce right now,'' said Chuck Coffee, a
speechwriter for Lt. Gov. Frank O'Bannon. ``It was much different
when the population was dependent on rail service and waited as
trains came to town,'' he said.
   Indiana balks at joining with the rest of the Eastern time zone
in observing daylight saving time, officials say, because it lies
on the western edge of the zone and already has a relatively late
sunrise. Daylight saving time would exacerbate that, much to the
displeasure of farmers who relish the early daylight hours for
field work.
   Simply going on Central time is opposed by many others who feel
Indiana is more attuned to New York and eastern cities and changing
would put it out of step the entire year.
   ``Why would someone think that they are traveling within the
same state and the time's going to change?'' said Carolyn
McClintock, Vanderburgh County commissioner.

   The head of the National Organization for
Women on Saturday praised Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus' veto of a
restrictive abortion bill, but said she didn't know what influence
a threatened boycott of Idaho potatoes had on him.
   ``How much effect the threat of a boycott had, I haven't the
vaguest idea, but he certainly did, in my opinion, the right
thing,'' NOW President Molly Yard told reporters.
   Ms. Yard, attending NOW's Northeast regional conference, said
pleas from teen-agers, letters and telegrams from pro-choice forces
and calls from other governors opposed to the Idaho legislation
probably helped influence Andrus.
   ``I think that Gov. Andrus thought very, very carefully about
what he was doing, and I think there are many reasons that went
into his decision, which was obviously done with care,'' Ms. Yard
said.
   ``He clearly did talk to the medical profession and the legal
profession. He was advised by the latter that the bill was
unconstitutional, and he was advised by the former that women would
virtually be banned from having abortions,'' she said. ``I think
that troubled him.''
   Ms. Yard rejected the suggestion that NOW's threatened boycott
would have been unfair to Idaho potato growers who had nothing to
do with the abortion bill. Nine of the Idaho lawmakers who voted on
the bill were potato growers, she said.
   ``The onus is on them,'' Ms. Yard said. ``They brought it on
themselves.''
   Ms. Yard went to the weekend conference prepared to make a pitch
for Maine potatoes, but Andrus announced his veto Friday night of
what would have become the most restrictive abortion law in the
United States had he signed it.
   ``I listened to his statement last night,'' Ms. Yard said. ``It
is the first time I've ever heard a man say exactly what I feel
about expecting any woman to carry her pregnancy to term if she's
been raped or she's pregnant because of incest, and he said it
eloquently.
   ``I'm sure lots of men feel that way. It's the first time I've
ever heard a man say it out loud.''
   Despite Friday's victory for pro-choice groups, Ms. Yard said
activists still face tough fights over abortion rights in Florida,
Illinois amd other states.

<HEAD>Group Claims Attack on Polish Diplomat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A previously unknown group claimed
responsibility Saturday for the shooting of a Polish diplomat and
his wife, warning Poland not to help Soviet Jews travel to Israel.
   The shootings Friday night came less than a week after Poland
offered to help Soviet Jews emigrate to Israel. Palestinian
extremists have threatened attacks against countries that assist in
the migration.
   The claim of responsibility came in a handwritten Arabic
statement from ``the Revolutionary Action Organization, the Arab
Resistance Front-The Martyr Suleiman al-Halabi unit'' published by
the leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir.
   ``Our group is behind the Polish diplomats operation. We warn
the Polish government against providing any assistance in
transporting Soviet Jews to our sacred land in Palestine,'' the
statement said.
   The Pole, his country's commercial attache, and his Lebanese
wife were wounded by assailants with automatic rifles who fired at
them as they were parking their embassy car near the Bristol Hotel
in Moslem west Beirut.
   They were rushed to the American University Hospital, where
doctors said they were off the critical list.
   The Polish official was first identified by police as Bugdan
Zbigniew, 47, and his wife as Eva Sarkis. The hospital said he was
registered as Bogdan Sarkis. The official Polish news agency PAP
identified the couple as Bogdan and Eva Sarka.
   A man who answered the phone in the wounded official's hospital
room and identified himself only as a friend, refused to give the
Pole's last name saying he was ``in danger.'' He said the name
Zbigniew was not correct.
   A hospital medical bulletin said the Pole had a bullet wound in
the chest and his wife suffered minor wounds in the left arm.
   The Polish government condemned the attack and said it was
taking increased measures to protect diplomats and other overseas
employees.
   In a dispatch from Warsaw, PAP said the Foreign Ministry
``strongly condemns this terrorist act. ... Poland will undertake
all efforts to counteract terrorism abroad.''
   Poland's prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, offered transport
to Israel-bound Soviet Jews after Hungary's Malev airline stopped
charters and some scheduled flights to Israel because of threats
from Palestinian extremists.
   Malev later resumed scheduled flights but said it would not
reinstate the charters. The airline also discontinued its flights
to Beirut on Tuesday.
   Its officials had said Malev received a bomb threat from the
Lebanon-based Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Many Arabs fear the influx of Soviet Jews in Israel and the
occupied territories will displace Palestinians and strengthen
Israel's grip on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Poland's Foreign Ministry had said it was aware that a decision
to transport Soviet Jews to Israel in Polish airliners might have
adverse effects for Poland. The Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
reported this week the ministry feared attacks on the 10,000 Poles
employed in Arab countries.

   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee is urging the agency to recommend the use of the drug AZT
in treating children suffering from acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The action came Friday at a meeting of the Antiviral Drugs
Advisory Committee and now goes to the agency for a final decision.
   An FDA decision to approve labeling of AZT for use in treating
children with AIDS would encourage more doctors to prescribe it for
youngsters and enable patients to collect reimbursement from their
insurance companies.
   The agency already has approved the use of the drug for adults
and has permitted youngsters suffering from the disease to receive
it.
   The manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome Co., has been distributing
the drug at no charge as part of an FDA program to accelerate the
distribution of experimental drugs to patients who are seriously
ill.
   The company began marketing the drug in a strawberry-flavored
syrup in October.

<HEAD>Agreement Near on Satellite Sales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. trade negotiators said Saturday they were
close to an agreement with the Japan over removing barriers to the
sale of U.S.-made satellites in that country.
   The officials said the agreement could be completed as early as
Monday.
   It would mark the second success in a 10-month negotiating
effort being conducted under the threat of economic retaliation by
the U.S. against Japan.
   A week ago, negotiators announced the first breakthrough in the
talks, an agreement to expand sales of U.S. supercomputers in
Japan. A U.S. trade official, who spoke on condition his name not
be used, said Saturday that only one technical issue remained to be
resolved in the satellite talks.
   He said that the Japanese had agreed to American demands to
allow U.S. satellite manufacturers to compete on an equal footing
with Japanese companies on satellite projects being sponsored by
the Japanese government.
   Only two weeks ago, U.S. negotiators were expressing dismay with
what they considered the unwillingness of the Japanese to make
concessions on the satellite issue.
   However, when the Japanese team arrived Thursday to resume
talks, there were reports they were bringing new proposals that
would meet American demands.
   Satellites and supercomputers are two of the products singled
out last May by the Bush administration as areas where the Japanese
had erected unfair barriers to the sale of American goods.
   With the resolution of these two issues, only lumber products
remain in dispute in the so-called Super 301 negotiations.
   While negotiators have reported some success at narrowing the
differences, the American side is still not satisfied with the
access being offered by the Japanese to their market for lumber
products.
   Further talks in the lumber area are scheduled for later in
April. The Japanese have been negotiating against a June 16
deadline.
   The Bush administration is empowered under the 1988 Trade Act to
raise tariffs on Japanese products if Japan refuses to open markets.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, in an effort to stop smuggling
that has left store shelves bare throughout the country, has
announced that Soviet tourists will be forbidden from taking most
consumer goods abroad.
   The list of banned goods seems endless. Soviet tourists are now
barred from leaving the country with everything ranging from car
batteries to tires, mushrooms, caviar, electric wire, bicycles,
cooking oil, fabrics and nearly all food products.
   Valery Draganov, deputy head of the Customs Authority, announced
the clampdown on exports Friday evening and said it was made
necessary by chronic shortages of consumer supplies throughout the
Soviet Union.
   ``These are extraordinary, emergency measures needed to
stabilize the consumer market,'' he said.
   He said the restrictions would not apply to purchases made in
Soviet hard-currency stores, which do not accept rubles and
generally cater to foreigners, or to companies authorized to
conduct international trade.
   The move seems designed to appeal to Soviet shoppers who often
spend hours standing in line outside stores with meager supplies.
   But for Soviets who travel abroad, the announcement was
devastating.
   Soviets are only permitted to leave the country with the
equivalent of $30 to $200 dollars, depending on the length and type
of trip.
   To save money, many Soviets bring food with them, while others
take along expensive consumer items to pick up spare cash. Soviet
goods are generally cheaper than their Western counterparts,
although they are usually of a lower quality.
   Draganov said the new restrictions will last throughout 1990.
   ``The consumer market is becoming more and more naked,'' he
said. ``The situation is becoming even more complex since we
witness an increased activity of mafia groups.''
   He said underground groups have been known to purchase large
shipments of consumer goods from factories and ship them out of the
country before they reach Soviet stores.
   ``We had to stop this mass export of commodities immediately,''
Draganov said.
   At Chop, a border crossing station in the Western Ukraine,
customs officials recently confiscated 200 sets of linens, 20
bicycles and six gasoline-powered saws from Soviet tourists.
   Dragonov said tourists were ``trying to bring out ... virtually
everything one can think of.''
   He said they also have been caught at border crossings smuggling
cheeses, buckets, mousetraps, electric irons, toys, socks and
metalwork equipment.
   ``Notice that these goods disappear very quickly from the
shelves of our shops,'' he said.
   The smuggling tourists are not only Soviets. National television
recently showed a huge warehouse filled with TV sets and other
goods it said were confiscated from Polish tourists.

<HEAD>Among Broadcasters, Cable-Bashing Is In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television's free ride is over, and
consumer complaints and runaway rates will bring the ``pay TV''
industry under increased government regulation, the nation's
broadcasters were told Satuday.
   ``We began the 1980s with cable an infant industry, crying for
special privilege just to survive,'' Edward O. Fritts, president of
the National Association of Broadcasters, said in his ``state of
the industry'' address.
   ``Cable is multiplying faster than radio formats,'' Fritts said,
calling for Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to
``restore enough balance to the competitive forces to let consumers
decide how much programming they want for free.''
   The NAB _ fighting cable's encroachment into the lucrative TV
business, is backing moves to put cable-TV monopolies under
increased regulatory control, Legislation cracking down on the
cable companies should pass in this session of Congress, said Sen.
Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee.
   ``The service is sorry, and the rates are horrendous,'' Hollings
said. ``We find that's the case all over the country.''
   Legislative efforts are under way to allow price controls in
areas where cable companies have monopolies, and to enable
communities to better ride herd on the service the companies
provide.
   Congress should not _ and will not _ regulate cable TV
programming, but cracking down on service and prices is another
matter, Hollings said. ``I think we'll get that passed this year,''
he said.
   Congress is likely to restore the ``must-carry'' provision,
requiring cable companies to carry local TV broadcasting, Hollings
predicted.
   Hollings said he personally is the victim of his local cable
company, at his home on the Isle of Palms, where Hurricane Hugo
slammed ashore last September.
   ``The hurricane hit us on Sept. 21,'' Hollings said. ``Someday,
I hope to get back cable.''
   Hollings said that by the turn of the century, more than half
the TV watchers in America will be paying for the privilege.
   ``We call your industry mature,'' he told the broadcasters.
``That means you're not going to get much growth.''
   But he discounted the notion the government might ever help
people pay their TV bills, no matter how ubiquitous pay services
become. ``I've heard we're going to have broadcast stamps like food
stamps,'' he said. ``This country's gone crazy in a lot of
respects, but not that crazy.''
   The NAB is seeking government help in saving AM radio, whose
audience has largely left for better-sounding FM.
   Fritts called for the government to clear up frequency and
transmission questions, clearing the way for an AM stereo
renaissance.
   ``It is clear,'' he said, ``that the AM band must have the
improvement that NAB has requested.''
   ``Free, over-the-air broadcasting'' is being repeated like a
mantra this weekend, while some 50,000 broadcasters and exhibitors
ponder the future of the industry.
   ``There are many prophets with a pitch who glibly assure us that
broadcasting is in its twilight years,'' Fritts said. ``They are
wrong.''
   He hailed the powerful presence of the broadcast media in
fueling democratic revolutions across Europe _ the equivalent of
revolutionary-era printing in this country.
   Radio and TV, he said, are ``the modern manifestation of the
free media that has served our people so well.''

<HEAD>State Investigating its Handling of GDC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fraud indictment of Florida's
biggest land developer has prompted state business regulators to
investigate the state's hands-off handling of the troubled General
Development Corp.
   The Miami-based land developer pleaded guilty in federal court
last month to mail-fraud conspiracy for misleading customers and
overpricing nearly 10,000 homes. Class-action lawsuits against the
company involve 60,000 buyers.
   ``We need to do a better job of protecting the public,'' said
Stephen MacNamara, secretary of the Department of Business
Regulation. ``Clearly from what I've seen and read, we have not
done the job we should have done.''
   For its part, state regulators waived any tangible security
requirement for General Development Corp. and big developers
Deltona Corp. and Avatar Holdings that would have guaranteed
construction of roads and other basic improvements.
   ``I was aware of the rule and unaware of the things being
granted,'' said MacNamara, who has headed the department for one
year. ``We definitely have to change the policy.''
   The state investigation is to determine what action should have
been taken against the developer during the 1980s; who was
responsible for lax enforcement of state regulations; and, what
charges are needed.
   Two recent resignations from the department involve the land
sales division, but neither the state nor the employees are saying
if the resignations are related to General Development Corp.
   E. James Kearney, director of the Division of Land Sales,
Condominiums and Mobile Homes, finished work Friday. Samuel
Griffis, bureau chief of Land Sales Registration, submitted his
resignation March 15.
   Complaints filed at the Division of Land Sales between 1987 and
1989 charged that the developer was committing fraud and failing to
complete road improvements for fully paid lot owners.
   A 1985 agreement between General Development Corp. and the
division said that if the developer failed to meet its obligation
to make road improvements for fully paid lot owners, the division
could ``seek administrative or judicial remedy.''
   Despite mounting complaints, Kearney said he saw no reason to
take action against the developer and said it had never missed
making improvements. ``They've been delayed because of
environmental reasons,'' he said. ``Everybody gets delayed because
of environmental reasons.''
   Attorney Richard Bennett, who has been battling for General
Developer Corp. home and lot owners for six years, complained that
the Division of Land Sales ``was not consumer-oriented and not
aggressive in solving the complaints.''
   ``That's why we've brought these class-actions, because GDC
breached its contract with its customers, and the customers were
unable to persuade state or federal governmental regulators to
assist them to resolve their complaints,'' he said.
   MacNamara says he may want to toughen division policies and give
consumers more information about developers involved in lawsuits.
   If the Division of Land Sales is not already required to turn
over information to the attorney general's office about a developer
suspected of fraudulent dealings, the practice should become
division policy, he said.
   General Development Corp. estimates it would cost about $400
million to finish developing its land, but only $102.1 million is
budgeted for improvements, according to its latest annual report to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Rival Christian forces pounded east
Beirut with artillery barrages Saturday after a night of
house-to-house fighting under parachute flares for control of
Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   Police said at least 53 people were killed and 133 wounded since
the new round of full-scale warfare erupted at dawn Friday between
Gen. Michel Aoun's 19,000 army troops and Christian warlord Samir
Geagea's 6,000 Lebanese Forces militiamen.
   The killings raised the overall death toll to 829 killed and
2,289 wounded since Jan. 30, when Aoun moved against Geagea in a
bid to crush the only significant challenge to the general's
authority in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   The new round of fighting shattered a March 3 cease-fire, which
had been threatened by sporadic clashes for weeks.
   Police said Aoun's forces used 155mm howitzer batteries to pour
shells onto Beirut's port and the adjacent seaside Karantina
district, which houses Geagea's military command.
   Geagea's gunners returned the fire and blasted the army-held
mountain resort towns of Bekfaya, Brummana and Ein Saadeh with
multi-barreled rocket launchers.
   ``Why are these madmen raining death and destruction on us all
over again?'' screamed Madeleine Tabet, a Christian housewife
reached by telephone at the basement of her east Beirut home.
   The bombardment interrupted an exodus of east Beirut residents
fleeing to the divided city's Moslem sector. Cars in long lines
bumped into each other as motorists driving westward came under
shellfire.
   Huge clouds of black smoke obscured east Beirut and the
Christian hinterland as the shelling raged Saturday, setting dozens
of buildings ablaze and touching off forest fires.
   Shells hit schools, churches, monasteries, apartments and
bakeries in Beirut's Christian sector and several towns in Kesrouan
province, 20 miles northeast of the capital.
   Police said gasoline storage tanks at several filling stations
hit Friday burned out of control through Saturday. Scores of houses
collapsed, some on their tenants.
   Parachute flares illuminated Kesrouan as the warring Christians
battled at night for the key highway town of Kleiat and neighboring
villages, police reported.
   ``They are fighting from house to house in Kleiat and trading
hit-and-run grenade assaults in the streets of east Beirut. The
dust hasn't settled yet but no side has made any territorial
gains,'' said the police spokeman. He could not be named under
standing regulations.
   Kleiat controls the only highway that can be used by tanks
between Kesrouan, a major Geagea stronghold, and Aoun's main power
bases in Metn Province.
   Tens of thousands of residents remained huddled in basements and
bomb shelters in east Beirut for a second day while hundreds of
familes sought refuge in the chilly pine forests of Kesrouan, the
spokesman said.
   Aoun's failure to subdue Geagea appears to be undermining his
political stature and Geagea's public appeals for a settlement
based on a Christian allegiance to the Syrian-backed government of
President Elias Hrawi have been gaining momentum.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronites, a 900,000-strong Christian
sect that has dominated Lebanon's politics since it gained
independence from France in 1943.
   Antoine Beshara, a Maronite who heads Lebanon's 300,000-strong
Federation of Labor Unions, has declared support for Hrawi, whose
internationally recognized government is based in Moslem west
Beirut.
   Geagea's militia on Friday cooperated with troops under Hrawi's
army commander, Gen. Emille Lahoud, when they reopened the port
crossing between Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors after a
year-long closure.
   Hrawi, 64, was elected by parliament Nov. 24 with a mandate to
enforce an Arab League-brokered peace plan to resolve Lebanon's
civil war. The peace plan gives Moslems an equal share of power
with Christians.
   Hrawi fired Aoun as army commander and interim prime minister.
But the general has held out in the presidential palace in a
Christian enclave east of Beirut, claiming Hrawi's election was
unconstitutional.
   Aoun has also rejected the Arab League peace plan because it did
not guarantee a total withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops.

<HEAD>Nepel Government Closes Schools to Put Down Democracy Movement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government closed all high schools in
the capital and two suburbs Saturday to try to curb student
demonstrations for multiparty politics, state-owned radio reported.
   The move came hours after police fired tear gas and rifles to
disperse about 5,000 people who poured into the streets of Patan, a
Katmandu suburb, to protest the killings of two demonstrators
Friday, witnesses said.
   The demonstrations are part of a growing movement demanding
restoration of a multiparty political system in this Himalayan
kingdom, one of the oldest monarchies in the world.
   At least 14 people have been killed since Feb. 18, when King
Birendra's government cracked down on the movement led by the
Nepali Congress Party and a coalition of left-wing parties.
   In the lastest government response, the state-owned radio,
quoting the Ministry of Education, said about 100 schools in
Katmandu, Bhakatapur and Patan will remain closed indefinitely.
   ``Due to lack of educational atmosphere in some schools of
Katmandu valley, the government has decided to close down all high
schools,'' the radio said.
   Students have taken part in the nationwide demonstrations, which
have often turned violent. Hundreds of people _ including doctors,
lawyers and journalists in addition to students _ have been
arrested.
   The government had already closed Tribhuvan University's five
colleges around the country.
   Besides street protests, the political turmoil is also bringing
criticism within the government. It suffered the latest blow Friday
when Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya resigned over the
government's handling of the issue.
   Upadhyaya said he had advised Prime Minister Marich Man Singh
Shrestha to hold talks with the activists, but that his advice went
unheeded.
   The government says Nepal already has a working democracy, even
though a royal decree bans political parties. Officials accuse the
demonstrators of trying to foist their brand of democracy on the
country.
   Nepal once tried a Western-style democracy in 1959, when the
Nepali Congress Party was overwhelmingly voted to power and formed
the country's first parliamentary government. The experiment ended
when King Mahendra, Birendra's father, dismissed the government in
1961, accusing it of corruption and mismanagement.

<TEXT>
   A three-time mugging victim, indicted on a
weapons charge after saying she shot an armed man who was trying to
rob her, has hired Bernhard Goetz's lawyer to defend her, the Daily
News reported Saturday.
   Ysesnande Bureau, 20, said she was attacked Monday night with a
girlfriend who died from gunshots fired from a car moments after
the mugger fled. She was charged with possession of a deadly weapon
and freed Friday on $500 bail.
   Her lawyer, Barry Slotnick, denounced prosecutors for pressing
charges against his client. ``She is one of the many innocent
victims in New York City,'' Slotnick said.
   Slotnick also represented Goetz, who was convicted on a weapons
charge for shooting four youths he said were trying to rob him on a
subway train.
   ``She is another decent, law-aiding citizen who was brutalized
in several muggings and was forced to carry a gun to protect
herself,'' Slotnick was quoted as saying.
   Slotnick gave the following account of the incident:
   Bureau and her friend, Theresa Jackson, 19, were in Jackson's
car waiting for a green light in the Crown Heights section of
Brooklyn.
   An armed man jerked open the driver's door and tried to snatch
Jackson's purse, then tried to rip Jackson's earrings off.
   Bureau pulled out her gun, a .25 caliber pistol, and fired once,
grazing the forehead of Clint Smith, 24.
   Smith fled and the women drove off. A few blocks later, a car
pulled up next to them. Someone inside fired a shot that hit
Jackson in the head. She died Wednesday at Kings County Hospital.
   Smith was arrested late Monday when he went to a hospital to be
treated for his head wound. He was held on $100,000 bail on
attempted robbery charges. Police have not made an arrest in
Jackson's slaying.

<HEAD>Text of Gorbachev's Message to the Lithuanian People</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lithuania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's appeal Saturday to the Lithuanian people as carried by
the Tass news agency. The statement was read by announcers on Radio
Moscow and Soviet television.
   Dear citizens of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic,
   I am addressing you at a difficult time for our country. The
March 11 decisions of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet have brought us
to a critical point.
   The attempts being taken by the incumbent Lithuanian leadership
to break the republic's ties with the Soviet Union and its tactics
of unilateral and ultimate actions endanger the normal life and
security of all people in the republic, Lithuanians and
non-Lithuanians, and are a cause of grave concern in the country.
   Is it normal when amendments to the constitution, resolving the
destiny of the republic and its people and concerning the interests
of the entire country, are adopted in haste, without consultations
and discussions, actually within one night?
   The third congress of U.S.S.R. People's Deputies urged the
Supreme Soviet of the republic to renounce political recklessness.
The Lithuanian leadership responded to this appeal for common sense
with the escalation of irresponsible and illegitimate decisions.
   This juxtaposes Lithuania with other constituent republics and
the whole of the Soviet Union and undermines the historically
established ties and cooperation between our peoples.
   The actions being taken in Lithuania have no logical foundation.
They are being taken at a time when we have begun to resolve vital
issues of the Soviet federation on a really democratic basis.
   What is our position? It is the sincere adherence to the ideas
of the free and original development of all peoples of our country,
and respect for their legitimate rights to self-determination and
sovereignty. This fully refers to the Lithuanian people, too.
   Now attempts are being made to convince you that genuine
sovereignty within the Soviet Union, without breaking away from it,
is impossible. Simultaneously, old grudges are being purposefully
kindled and the dark sides of joint life are being emphasized.
   Indeed, our past includes many things that we are mutually
rejecting. And this refers not only to the Lithuanian people. But
no one can say that in the years of perestroika any people in our
country has been deliberately elevated or purposefully humiliated.
   We have for years lived in one home. Does the past time deserve
only bad words? Have the Lithuanian literature and poetry, theater
and cinema, music and architecture, education and sports faded and
got lost in the multicoloured Soviet culture?
   Was it not in the mutual work and with the fraternal aid from
other republics that your industry and agriculture have been
developing? Did Lithuania itself not extend a helping hand to other
peoples in times of trouble?
   Did the Lithuanian citizens not support the U.S.S.R.
constitution, by which Lithuania abided for years honestly and
strictly as a fully-fledged republic?
   The incumbent Lithuanian leaders are trying to convince you that
their separatist actions will not affect the economic, scientific,
technical and other ties with the other republics of the U.S.S.R.
   But this is not so, because all these ties can develop normally
and yield fruits only in a favourable atmosphere of confidence and
mutual assistance and not in the situation of confrontation,
ultimatums, disrespect for one another and ethnic strife.
   The pointed disrespect for the U.S.S.R. constitution, the
challenge to Soviet laws and the non-implementation of union
obligations give rise to just indignation all over the country.
   The president of the U.S.S.R., the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet and
the U.S.S.R. government are receiving numerous letters and
telegrams expressing utter concern and perplexity in connection
with the developments in Lithuania.
   People demand that the U.S.S.R. constitution be defended and
that the union be protected from the harm caused by the actions of
separatists. They propose taking effective economic, political and
administrative measures.
   People in Byelorussia and Kaliningrad region are raising the
issue of returning territories transferred to Lithuania after it
joined the U.S.S.R.
   In general, the situation in the republic and around it has
become dramatic. If the voice of reason is not heeded now,
developments can have grave consequences for all of us. We must be
united in striving to prevent this.
   I have appealed to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, proposing that
it immediately annul the illegal acts it has adopted. This will
open a possibility for discussing the entire range of problems on
the solely acceptable basis _ within the framework of the U.S.S.R.
constitution.
   I am expressing hope that my appeal will be supported by the
citizens of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.

<HEAD>Eastern Overlooked Positive Test Until Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines took no action against a flight
engineer who tested positive for cocaine use until managers learned
he had been charged with buying crack seven months later, the
airline said Saturday.
   The test results apparently went unnoticed because of a clerical
error, said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   Dain Schneemilch, 36, of Key Largo, Fla., was fired March 20,
but the Air Line Pilots Association has filed a grievance to appeal
the dismissal, she said.
   Schneemilch returned to work for the strike-plagued carrier in
the midst of a machinists' union strike that initially brought
Eastern flights to a virtual halt. Under company policy, returning
workers were required to submit to drug tests.
   Schneemilch tested positive for cocaine use last July 19, an
offense that warrants firing under Eastern rules, the Miami-based
airline said. But the results entered his personnel file without
action.
   ``We were in the middle of a big buildup,'' Ceremsak said.
``There was a tremendous volume. At that time, somehow
inadvertently the results of his tests were not picked up on. It
was some sort of clerical error that his positive readout was not
caught.''
   Schneemilch went back to work as a second officer serving as
flight engineer, the No. 3 position in the cockpit, on Boeing 727s.
He bid to become a first officer, or co-pilot, and got the
promotion on the basis of seniority Sept. 18, Ceremsak said.
   Schneemilch was still attending ground pilot school when he was
arrested after allegedly buying a $20 crack cocaine rock from an
undercover sheriff's officer, Ceremsak said. He flew no airline
flights as a co-pilot, she said.
   Authorities have video and audio tapes of the arrest.
Schneemilch, who tested negative for cocaine in an Eastern test
four days before his arrest, has pleaded innocent and is awaiting
disposition of the drug case.
   Defense attorney Timothy Thomes refused comment, saying, ``We're
not trying to cover anything up, but by the same token while
matters are pending we would have no comment.''
   When it learned of the arrest, Eastern checked its drug test
results, found the old records and confronted Schneemilch, Ceremsak
said. He resigned but rescinded his resignation two weeks later,
which led to his firing last month.
   The Federal Aviation Administration ``asked us to go back and
review all of the drug tests that had been administered, and we
went back through hundreds of files and that was the only error,''
she said.
   The FAA has ordered random drug testing of airline employees
since last December. Eastern policy already called for testing of
all new employees and testing of pilots during their annual
physical.
   Christopher Witkowski, director of the Aviation Consumer Action
Project, questioned Eastern's methods for assuring its pilots are
drug-free and FAA monitoring when Eastern was hiring about 1,000
pilots from April to August last year.
   ``To say that it's an oversight shows that there's something
wrong in how safe an airline they are,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   NASA, in a rare move, advanced the
launch date Saturday for the shuttle Discovery and its prestigious
payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Discovery now is due to lift off April 10, two days earlier than
planned.
   ``The shuttle team is ready to fly. Hubble is one of the most
exciting payloads ever launched aboard the shuttle, and we're
looking forward to the mission,'' said William Lenoir, associate
administrator for space flight for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   The space agency's Flight Readiness Review Board decided to move
up the mission after meeting for two days at Kennedy Space Center.
   NASA said last week technicians needed little of the contingency
time built into Discovery's prelaunch schedule.
   Once deployed by Discovery's astronauts, the Hubble will orbit
380 miles above Earth for 15 years. The telescope will be capable
of looking seven times more deeply into space with greater clarity
and detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best ground-based
observatory.
   Astronomers expect to use it to study stars and galaxies so
distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14
billion years.
   NASA occasionally has shifted shuttle launch dates because of
scheduling changes in the months prior to liftoff. But it is the
first time liftoff has been accelerated during orbiter processing.
   In February, Discovery's launch date was changed from April 18
to April 12 after the lower right segment of the shuttle's solid
rocket booster was replaced more quickly than anticipated.
   The telescope's installation into the orbiter was delayed last
week, however, after small mosquito-like insects called midges
invaded a payload preparation room at the launch pad. Engineers
feared the bugs might damage the sensitive instrument, the most
expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built.
   Forty midges were trapped, and technicians loaded the
25,000-pound telescope into the shuttle's payload bay Thursday, two
days later than planned.
   Mission specialist Bruce McCandless II, one of Discovery's five
astronauts, helped link electrical connections between Discovery
and Hubble on Friday. He also checked the telescope for sharp edges
that might snag spacesuits in the event of a spacewalk.
   McCandless and mission specialist Kathryn Sullivan are prepared
to step into space should the telescope need to be adjusted or
repaired following deployment. It would be the first American
spacewalk since 1985.
   Technicians planned to test the telescope's systems and
scientific instruments Sunday. They want to ensure remote
communications with the Space Telescope Operations Control Center
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and other
facilities.
   The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, who discovered in the 1920s the universe is constantly
expanding, a finding that is the basis for the current Big Bang
theory of the formation of the universe.

<TEXT>
   A pet store owner says he no longer owns a
deadly pet piranha fish that could threaten Oklahoma wildlife, and
just to prove it he brought the fish to court _ frozen in a
dripping bag of ice.
   Bob Geary was cited in early January for violating a state law
banning piranhas because they could pose a danger to wildlife if
released into a lake.
   He said a supplier sent him the fish by mistake four years ago,
and he asked a district judge Jan. 26 to give him a chance to keep
it.
   Geary said he'd try to persuade the state Wildlife Conservation
Department to let him keep the fish, and promised to send it to
Kansas if he failed. But he returned to court Friday to say the
deal is, well, dead.
   Geary said the fish died two weeks ago when someone mistakenly
turned up the heat in its tank.
   Prosecutor Clayton Niemeyer had agreed to drop the case if Geary
could prove the fish had died. ``He spent $4,000 defending his fish
and the fish is no longer alive, so I saw no reason to pursue it
further,'' Niemeyer said.
   Niemeyer called the evidence produced in court Friday a
``fish-sicle.''
   The frozen piranha was turned over to state wildlife rangers,
who said they would have it stuffed and use it for educational
purposes.

   A 24-year-old woman who was expecting twins in
July has delivered one baby, but will have to wait on the other.
   In a rare birth doctors say was one of just 14 cases reported
nationally, Donna Krasenics delivered a 1-pound, 8-ounce baby girl,
Shakoora, at Crawford Long Hospital on Thursday, 15 weeks
prematurely.
   Shakoora was listed in critical condition in Crawford Long's
intensive care unit Saturday. Her mother was in good condition.
   Doctors were able to stop Mrs. Krasenics' labor with the second
baby, and hospital officials said she will remain in bed until her
second child is delivered.
   ``Shakoora is my first child, and I wasn't paying much attention
to anything except the birth when I heard somebody in the delivery
room say something about there being only 13 known cases like
mine,'' Mrs. Krasenics said.
   Officials said the baby was delivered as Dr. Camille
Davis-Williams tried to stop the premature birth of Shakoora. The
amniotic sac for the second baby did not break, so the doctor was
able to halt further labor, Brown said.
   Dr. Paul Brown, an assistant professor at Emory University's
department of obstetrics and gynecology, had planned to report his
two-year case study of such births, but decided to hold off to
include the Krasenics birth.
   Only 13 such births have been reported in medical literature, he
said. ``The medical community does not know why a patient goes into
premature labor in these cases,'' Brown said.

   The heart of London became a battleground
Saturday, and fashionable shopping and theater districts packed
with locals and tourists suddenly found themselves at the mercy of
roving gangs.
   It was a scene more reminiscent of street fighting in Beirut or
Israel's occupied territories than London's favorite tourist
haunts: Trafalgar Square, Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus and
Leicester Square.
   Running battles between rock-throwing militants and riot police
left a trail of injury and destruction, from overturned and
burned-out cars to smashed windows and looted shops.
   The militants, who broke off from a protest by more than 40,000
people demonstrating against a new nationwide local tax, smashed
plate-glass windows at some of the world's most famous stores,
including Liberty's, Aquascutum, Wedgwood and Mappin and Webb.
   ``The mindless mob, although a small minority, has taken over,''
said a uniformed policeman at the intersection of Oxford and Regent
streets.
   On Charing Cross Road, a mile away, looters carried away
expensive musical instruments even as police with riot shields
tried to clear the area. Two china shops on Regent Street also had
their display windows pillaged.
   Many of the broken windows set off burglar alarms, which mixed
with the constant wail of police sirens and fire engines.
   The rioting broke out in late afternoon as the stores prepared
to close for the weekend. It spread into the evening and overtook
theatergoers headed into London's West End for a Saturday night out.
   Several theaters kept their doors shut at the height of the
rampage, leaving ticket-holders standing outside. Some of them got
caught between the protesters and the police.
   Most shows went on, although some started late.
   One woman dressed in a silk dress and fur jacket walked up to a
riot policeman holding a shield outside the Palace Theatre at the
corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road. ``Excuse me,''
she said, ``have you got any idea how long this is going to last?''
   At the Duke of York Theatre in St. Martin's Lane, 650 people
were locked in as rioting flared outside during a performance of
the play ``Shirley Valentine.''
   ``It was like being under siege,'' said General Manager Andy
Phipps.
   One target of the rioters was the Renault showroom on Charing
Cross Road near the Leicester Square subway stop, one of five in
central London that were sealed off by police. The showroom's
floor-to-ceiling windows were smashed, and so were the windows of
every car inside.
   Rocks, cans, bricks and bottles were thrown through the windows
of banks, restaurants, shops, the royal jewelers Garrards, Tower
Records and nightclubs, including the popular Stringfellows.
Garbage cans heaved by the protesters ended up amidst spring
fashions and floral displays in many showrooms along Regent Street.
   Charing Cross Road and St. Martin's Lane, which runs from
Leicester Square to Trafalgar Square, were littered with rubble,
broken glass and torched cars.

   Jean-Marie Le Pen whipped his followers into
a frenzy of applause and singing Saturday, promising them that
their extreme-right National Front party stands on the threshold of
real political power.
   The 1,600 delegates to the Eighth Party Congress chose Le Pen by
cheers and handclapping to lead the party from the sidelines of
single-issue politics to what they hope will be victory in 1993
legislative elections.
   ``If I advance, follow me; if I die, avenge me; if I shirk, kill
me,'' the former paratrooper told the delegates. ``We are no longer
a tiny movement. We are today the leading political movement in
France.''
   Le Pen founded the anti-immigration party in 1972 and achieved
global notoriety in 1987 when he called the Nazi Holocaust a
``detail of history.''
   In a 90-minute speech punctuated by frequent applause and
chants, Le Pen accused both the governing Socialists and
traditional conservative parties of ``political AIDS.''
   He hammered away at a favorite theme: that other politicians
turn a blind eye to immigration, thereby stoking racial pressures
that will soon be insoluble except through violence.
   After the speech and Le Pen's re-election in the vast,
flag-draped amphitheater on the French Riviera, the crowd broke
into the ``Ode to Joy'' from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
   Earlier, about 700 people prayed outside the Palace of Justice
for the 6 million Jews killed during the Holocaust and to protest
the attendance of Franz Schoenhuber, leader of West Germany's
far-right Republican Party.
   Schoenhuber was a soldier in the Nazi SS during World War II.
His party and the National Front form an alliance at the European
Parliament in Strasbourg.
   The National Front won 12 pecent of the vote in presidential
elections in 1988, based on its anti-immigration platform. Its
support is strongest among white voters in areas where large
numbers of North African and black immigrants live.
   About 4 million of the country's 55 million people are
immigrants, the majority of them Moslems from North Africa.
   ``We are the expression of the French people who want to become
once again their own masters,'' said Bruno Megret, the party's
second in command. ``We will be in power before the end of the
decade.''
   The National Front hopes to broaden its platform to include
ecological issues in an effort to woo rural voters. The party
recently gained its first seat in the 577-seat National Assembly.
It held 35 seats until electoral changes in 1988 left the party
without representation.
   The congress came as leaders of France's mainstream conservative
parties met near Paris to work out a common position on immigration
ahead of talks with the Socialist government on racism next week.
   Premier Michel Rocard called for a conference with opposition
leaders to develop a common strategy on racism following a series
of racially motivated killings and beatings over past months. The
National Front was not invited.
   The mainstream rightist parties say anti-racism measures must be
accompanied by a revamped policy on immigration.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the Union
for French Democracy coalition, urged deporting illegal immigrants,
tightening political asylum rules, cutting social benefits to
immigrants and curbing the entry of their family members.
   ``France is not a country of immigration,'' Giscard said. ``The
most serious fault of the government is to have left this debate to
the extremists. Foreigners can live in France, with respect for
their human rights, but they cannot change France.''
   A poll taken during a six-month government investigation into
racism showed Monday that 75 percent of French citizens thought
there were too many North Africans in France.

   TV Marti, the U.S. television channel beamed

Cuba's official news agency reported.
   Prensa Latina, in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City, repeated
its position that the TV Marti broadcasts are illegal.
   ``The Cuban government considers the action as a violation of
the Caribbean country's sovereignty and of numerous international

   Cuba blocked the signal of what it calls ``channel worm'' when
it began transmitting on Tuesday and continued to jam broadcasts

   The Cuban government has lodged protests with the U.S. Federal

   A busload of U.S. soldiers stationed in

and some of them were critically wounded, a White House spokesman
said Saturday.
   The bus was fired upon with automatic gunfire about 1 p.m., EST
said spokesman Sean Walsh.
   He said the number and nature of the injuries was not known,
only that some were in serious and critical condition.
   ``We deplore any action against U.S. citizens. We'll be working
closely with the Honduran government on the investigation,'' said
Walsh.
   He said a leftist group in Honduras had claimed responsibility
for the action.
   The United States keeps several thousand personnel stationed in
Honduras, most of them based at Palmerola, a U.S.-built base
several miles from Tegucigalpa.

   Three snipers fired automatic

   The gunmen fired on the bus about 1 p.m. six miles north of
Tegucigalpa, the capital, said Maj. Bruce Jessup, a spokesman for
U.S. troops based in the Central American nation.
   He said two Americans were seriously wounded. They were taken to
a civilian hospital in Tegucigalpa and underwent surgery.
   There were 28 U.S. airmen on the bus, and they did not return
fire, Jessup said.
   ``The Americans did not have time to return fire, although there
were some security personnel on the bus,'' he said.
   He said a group called the Frente Moranzano Liberation Nacional
had claimed responsibility for the attack. He said the attackers
fled.
   At the time of the attack, the soldiers were returning to the
Soto Cano military base from a recreational tour, Jessup said.

<TEXT>
   The new local tax system that has angered many
Britons and prompted protests and riots across the country goes
into effect Sunday in England and Wales.
   Scotland has had the tax for a year.
   Anger over the tax has contributed to a record 28-point lead by
the main opposition Labor Party over Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's governing Conservatives, according to a Harris poll last
weekend.
   The community charge is levied by local governments on every
adult in a household. It replaces a single tax paid by each
household and based on the value of the property.
   That means that now a family with four members over age 18
living in a small apartment will pay four times as much as a single
person living in a large house.
   A duke in a 100-room mansion would pay as much as a street
sweeper in a cottage if they live in the same borough.
   The amount each person will pay is the same throughout a
community, but it varies widely from borough to borough depending
on the budget needs of the area.
   Critics of the new tax have dubbed it the ``poll tax'' after a
per-capita tax that set off a peasants' revolt in 1381.
   Low-income and disabled people can receive rebates of up to 80
percent on the new tax. But critics say it is unfair because unlike
the income tax, which is used to pay for national government
expenditures, it does not take into account an individual's ability
to pay.
   Legislation written by Mrs. Thatcher's government created the
tax with the aim of reducing central government subsidies to local
government. But members of local councils determine how much to
charge.
   The government expected the Labor Party to suffer in elections
because high-spending councils with a wide range of public services
are mostly run by Labor members who would have to set a high poll
tax to pay for them.
   But many of the highest increases have been set by Conservative
councils to maintain their services.
   The public was initially assured by civil servants and
Conservative lawmakers that the increases would be quite small.
   Scotland has had the tax for a year.
   The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 followed the imposition of the last
poll tax in England, when every person over the age of 15 was
ordered to pay.
   Crying ``Hang all the lawyers,'' 100,000 peasants marched on
London. They pillaged manor houses, burnt the court rolls
containing their names to destroy the evidence for taxation and
murdered lawyers, magistrates and other officials.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Simon of Sudbury, a lawyer, was also
chancellor of England and regarded by the rebels as one of those
responsible for imposing the tax. The rebels dragged him from the
Tower of London and beheaded him on Tower Hill.
   King Richard II rode to meet the rebels at Smithfield _ site of
London's present-day wholesale meat market _ and peasant leader Wat
Tyler was slain.
   The insurgents dispersed on the king's promise of reforms but
Richard sent an army of 40,000 men through the most rebellious
counties of Kent and Essex, and hundreds of peasants were put to
death.

   Investigators said Saturday that a
medical helicopter's engine cover came loose and was chopped up by
the rotor blades, scattering metal and fiberglass fragments on a
street where youths were playing.
   No one was injured in Thursday's incident in this Pittsburgh
suburb. The helicopter, flying to Washington Hospital to pick up a
patient, returned safely to its base at Allegheny General Hospital
in Pittsburgh.
   Originally, the accident had been blamed on a bird.
   Tom Mahony, a safety inspector with the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the most critical of the six latches holding a
fiberglass cowling in place over the engine apparently failed.
   An investigation on Friday found the latch ``shows some wear,
more than is normal,'' Mahony said. ``It's apparent that the latch
had failed and the airstream got underneath the cowling until it
separated from the airframe.''
   The 2-by-4-foot section got caught in the helicopter's main
rotors and was torn apart, Mahony said. One of the four rotors,
which are made of fiberglass with a metal leading edge, had what he
termed very minor damage.
   Mahony said the investigation ruled out the possibility the
helicopter had collided with a bird, as hospital officials
initially suspected.
   About a dozen metal and fiberglass fragments, one measuring more
than a foot square, showered down near where six children were
playing street hockey.
   ``It's a miracle none of us were hit,'' said one of the boys,
Michael Rosenberger, 17.
   The helicopter, a Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm BK-117, will return
to service as soon as repairs are completed, Mahony said. No action
will be taken against the pilot, John Johnston, or the hospital.
The FAA probably will carry out informal checks to determine
whether similar incidents have occurred, he said.
   The hospital made a thorough inspection of its other two Life
Flight helicopters and found nothing wrong, said spokesman Tom
Chakurda.

<HEAD>Former FDA Official Pleads Guilty in Generic Drug Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Food and Drug Administration
official pleaded guilty to accepting a $20,000 bribe to expedite a
generic drug maker's application in a scandal that has snared
several other FDA employees.
   Jan T. Sturm, 35, of Columbia, Md., pleaded guilty in U.S.
District Court on Friday to accepting the bribe from Raju Vegesna,
former president of American Therapeutics Inc. in Bohemia, N.Y.,
prosecutors said.
   Sturm, a former consumer safety officer in the FDA's generic
drug division, pleaded guilty to involvement in unlawful
gratuities, U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox said in a statement.
   Sturm faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, Willcox said. He is to be sentenced June 12.
   The former FDA official accepted the $20,000 to buy a new car in
exchange for expediting Vegesna's application to produce generic
drugs, Willcox said.
   American Therapeutics pleaded guilty Friday to one count of
using interstate facilities in aid of racketeering. The company
faces a maximum fine of $500,000, Willcox said.
   Sturm, American Therapeutics, Vegesna and former drug consultant
Mohammed Azeem were charged March 2 in a bribery scandal dating to
1988 that also involves Charles Y. Chang, former branch chief of
the generic drug division.
   Azeem pleaded guilty March 16 to interstate travel in aid of
racketeering and offering an illegal gratuity. Vegesna has not yet
entered a plea.
   American Therapeutics, Vegesna and Azeem allegedly provided
Chang with a trip to Hong Kong, Thailand, and London in 1987;
furniture; cash and a computer in return for his favor on generic
drug applications, Willcox said.
   The generic drug division approves applications of
pharmaceutical companies that seek to market generic drugs, which
are less expensive equivalents to brand-name drugs.
   Sturm was responsible for tracking the progress of drug
applications submitted by pharmaceutical companies.
   Chang pleaded guilty in May 1989 to two counts of interstate
travel in aid of racketeering.
   Last October, he was fined $10,000 and ordered to spend a year
in a federal work-release program and to perform 1,000 hours of
community service.
   Since the investigation began in 1988, three former FDA
employees, including Chang but not Sturm; three generic drug
company executives; and two generic drug companies in addition to
American therapeutics have been convicted.

<TEXT>
   Residents in this liberal college town
vote Monday on whether to impose a token $5 fine for abortions if
the procedure ever is banned by state or federal law.
   Abortion rights advocates say the small fine would create a
``zone of reproductive freedom'' in the event of a state or federal
ban, but the mayor, who favors abortion rights, says it would hurt
the city's reputation. The fine would be imposed on both the doctor
performing an abortion and the woman who underwent the operation.
   ``What it says to police is, `Don't go looking for abortion
criminals; go look for murderers and rapists,''' said Sabra Briere,
who put the proposal on the ballot with a 4,127-signature petition
drive.
   The ballot issue is yet another front in the lengthy, emotional
war over abortion. On Friday, Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus vetoed a bill
that would have created the nation's most restrictive state
abortion law.
   Proponents of the initiative say that if it were passed, and if
abortion were someday outlawed, city police would enforce the token
fine while state police would enforce whatever measure was approved
statewide.
   Ann Arbor, a city of nearly 108,000 people that is home to the
University of Michigan, bucked the Michigan trend on a 1988 ballot
by supporting the use of state funds for poor women's abortions.
   Briere, a student services coordinator at the university, said
Friday: ``I don't want to see abortion under attack any longer. It
shouldn't even be an issue at all.''
   The charter provision to make abortion an infraction similar to
a parking ticket would go into effect in the event of a state or
federal ban.
   About 22,000 of Ann Arbor's 60,000 registered voters are
expected to cast ballots Monday. About 15 percent of those voting
are expected to be students, said Republican Mayor Jerry Jernigan.
   Jernigan said the city council is pro-choice, but said he
doesn't believe the city should have jurisdiction over an issue
such as abortion.
   ``There's no question that this is hurting Ann Arbor's
reputation,'' Jernigan said, explaining that if the proposal
passes, it would make the city known as a place to get an abortion.
   He said the issue should have been been aired in public
hearings, which are not required for city ballot measures. Under
city law, the council could also enact such a fine.
   City Councilman Tom Richardson, a Republican facing re-election
Monday, agreed that the proposal doesn't belong on the city charter.
   ``I think it's absolutely abhorrent to take such a serious issue
as abortion and treat it in such a flippant way,'' he said.
   Local anti-abortion activists have remained relatively silent
about the proposal, concentrating instead on a petition drive to
require parental consent for anyone under 18 to have an abortion.
   ``We're putting our energies where they're more needed and more
effective,'' said Barbara Listing, president of Right to Life of
Michigan,
   Also on Monday's ballot in the city 38 miles west of Detroit is
a symbolic proposal to increase the fine for possessing or selling
marijuanan from $5 to $25. The fine has been in place since 1974,
enabling the city to prosecute offenders for ordinance violations
instead of misdemeanors under state law.
   Listing said Saturday she was basically ignoring the abortion
vote.
   ``Ann Arbor is a rather unique community,'' she said. ``Even if
it does pass, it's really not going to have any effect. Abortion is
still legal.''

   Dramatic changes in Eastern Europe are as
much spiritual as political, and were brought about by divine
intervention in the affairs of men, a Mormon Church leader said
Saturday.
   ``This only could have happened in such a miraculous way by the
intervening hand of the Almighty,'' Elder David B. Haight told the
160th Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
   The 7.3 million-member church has acted quickly to take
advantage of democratic political reforms in Eastern Europe.
   On July 1, church officials will establish the first Mormon
missions in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary since 1950. The plan
was announced previously.
   They hope eventually to gain recognition in the Soviet Union,
the People's Republic of China and many Islamic countries where the
Utah-based church has no official presence.
   Also Saturday, church leaders announced that a Brazilian lay
minister had been appointed to the highest church post ever held by
a black. Helvecio Martins, of Rio de Janeiro, was named to the
second Quorum of the Seventy, the lowest tier in the administrative
hierarchy of the 106-year-old church.
   He will have regional authority.
   Martins, 59, joined the church in 1972, six years before
Benson's predecessor, Spencer W. Kimball, announced a revelation
lifting of a ban against blacks holding the church's priesthood.
The appointment is for five years.
   Haight, speaking in the Tabernacle on Temple Square, challenged
church members to serve their fellow men by teaching the gospel of
Jesus Christ.
   ``We declare in all solemnity that the Lord is now preparing the
nations of the earth to receive the truth he desires them to
have,'' said Haight, a member of the faith's Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles, which advises the governing First Presidency.
   Haight said the news media have portrayed events in Eastern
Europe as a purely political revolution, when most of the
inhabitants of those countries see the upheaval as religious and
``have acknowledged the influence of divine revelation.''
   The church founded by Joseph Smith in upstate New York in 1830
has more than 40,000 full-time missionaries and 228 missions.
Mormons believe their church was formed for the purpose of teaching
the true gospel before Christ's return.
   Establishment of democracy and religious freedom followed
exposure, in a variety of ways, to those ideals, Haight said,
sounding a theme touched on by other members of the church
hierarchy opening the two-day conference.
   The church's ``prophet, seer and revelator,'' former U.S.
agriculture secretary Ezra Taft Benson, is feeble and, for the
second straight conference, did not address the gathering.
   The 90-year-old Mormon president attended the morning and
afternoon conference sessions, however, helped to and from his
chair by his two counselors in the First Presidency, Gordon B.
Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson.
   Monson opened the conference with a brief message in Benson's
behalf, saying Mormons have ``a responsibility to extend help as
well as hope to the hungry, to the homeless and to the downtrodden
both at home and abroad.''
   Elder Hans B. Ringger urged church members, who sometimes are
seen by their neighbors as standoffish, to move beyond their own
social and cultural circles.
   ``The needy are all around us. Too often, however, we are blind
to those needs or fear those people whose company makes us feel
uncomfortable,'' Ringger said. ``We have to rid ourselves of
religious, racial or social prejudices and expand the boundaries of
our service.''

<HEAD>Mugabe Wins in Zimbabwe Vote, But Opposition Gains Seats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe failed to
realize his dream of a one-party state when three opposition
members captured seats in parliamentary elections, according to
partial returns Saturday.
   ``It's a bitter blow,'' said a spokesman for Mugabe's governing
Marxist-Leninist Zimbabwe African National Union. ``Yet it could
have been worse.''
   Officials said 80 of 120 contested seats for the 150-member
parliament had been counted at the end of the day, and final
results were expected to be announced Sunday.
   However, Mugabe clearly emerged as the presidential victor. His
first challenger ever, Edgar Tekere, gained only 365,149 votes, or
17.3 percent, with returns counted in 106 districts.
   Tekere's fledgling opposition party, campaigning for similar
political reforms to those in Eastern Europe, captured more votes
than most analysts expected.
   In the voting, held Wednesday through Friday, Tekere's Zimbabwe
Unity Movement won a third of the ballots, capturing two
parliamentary seats, according to election officials.
   The candidate of the Zimbabwe African National Union, or Ndonga,
gained a third seat. The union represents the founder of the
governing party, the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole.
   A Methodist minister, Sithole has been living in exile in the
United States for several years, accused by security agents at home
of plotting to topple Mugabe's government.
   Tekere and an independent businessman represent the only
oppositon in the current body.
   Mugabe, 66, led the white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia to
independence as black-governed Zimbabwe after a seven-year
guerrilla war.
   But he has repeatedly said he wants a Marxist one-party system
in what is now one of Africa's few democracies, arguing that feuds
between rival movements in the infancy of independence hamper
development.
   Tekere, 52, was a ounder of Mugabe's party in 1963 when its aim
was to end 90 years of white minority rule. The past two years,
however, he has argued against a one-party state. Tekere was fired
from the governing party in 1988 after accusing politicians of
widespread corruption.
   Tekere, pointing to Eastern Europe, has contended that Zimbabwe
should broaden democracy and liberalize its economy.
   During the bitter campaign, Mugabe accused Tekere of plotting a
coup if he lost the election. Tekere claimed Mugabe was bent on
establishing a Marxist dictatorship.
   A weakness for Tekere is that many Zimbabweans remember that
shortly after independence he was acquitted, on a legal
technicality, of murdering an elderly white farmer.
   A Western African diplomat said the parliamentary districts held
by the opposition in the past ``were always marginal seats'' that
did not present a real challenge to the governing party.
   ``Mugabe's going to win, but he might find himself with an
opposition,'' the diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   During the campaign, Mugabe told voters his administration had
provided cheap health care and education.
   Fewer than half of the 4.8 million registered voters bothered to
go to the polls, even though they were extended from two days to
three.

<HEAD>Contras Preparing for War, Sandinista Paper Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista party newspaper said
Saturday that at least 1,000 armed Contra rebels have slipped back
into Nicaragua from Honduras, and it claimed they were preparing to
wage full-scale war.
   The military said nine Contras had been killed and 13 government
soldiers wounded in a series of new clashes.
   Contra representatives signed an agreement with Nicaragua's
incoming government to disband by April 20, five days before the
new administration of the United National Opposition takes over
from the leftist Sandinistas.
   Despite that March 23 pact, rebel leaders have said their forces
were taking their weapons as they moved from jungle camps in
neighboring Honduras back into Nicaragua.
   Contra leaders said last week that nearly all 12,000 of the
rebels in the camps had returned home.
   In its report Saturday, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada said
at least 1,000 Contras have moved back to Jinotega province, a
border area 120 miles north of Managua.
   Quoting an unidentified high Sandinista military leader,
Barricada said ``all indications are that (the Contras) are
preparing for an offensive.''
   The rebels are ``united and ready to develop a conventional war,
with sufficient munitions and supplies for two months,'' the
newspaper said.
   The Defense Ministry said the Contras attacked a Sandinista
military post Thursday night in Jinotega province, killing five
rebels and wounding five government soldiers.
   In other clashes, the Defense Ministry said four rebels died and
eight government soldiers were wounded in two Contra attacks in
northern Nicaragua. It gave no details.
   Barricada said the Contras have been demanding food from
peasants, stealing cattle and attacking civilians.
   Contra rebels interviewed by The Associated Press earlier in the
week said they would not turn over their arms until they are
convinced the government of President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro is in control of the nation's security forces.
   She defeated Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in Feb. 25
elections.
   The demobilization agreement calls for the rebels to be
repatriated to ``safety zones'' in Nicaragua that will be
supervised by international observers. No dates have been set for
disarming.
   The Contras have waged war against the Sandinistas, claiming
they betrayed the goals of the 1979 revolution that toppled the
Somoza family dynasty.
   Also Saturday, the National Assembly, still controlled by the
Sandinistas, passed a law protecting property titles to land owned
by 120,000 peasant farmers.
   Under the new law, the owners will be able to sell the land if
they choose.
   Officials for the incoming government have said they plan to
return some confiscated land to the people who owned it prior to
1979.

   Officials fighting to carry out
California's first execution in 23 years said Saturday the U.S.
Supreme Court had agreed to consider an appeal of a ruling blocking
the death sentence.
   The high court will take up the case of convicted double
murderer Robert Alton Harris on Monday, said state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp.
   After years of appeals, Harris, 37, was scheduled to die in the
gas chamber Tuesday for the kidnapping and murders of two San Diego
teen-agers in July 1978.
   But a federal appeals court on Friday stayed the execution.
Judge John Noonan of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that a lower court improperly refused to hold a fact-finding
hearing on Harris' claim he didn't get adequate psychiatric
evaluation at the time of his original trial in 1979.
   The state immediately appealed the ruling.
   ``If Robert Harris had been deprived of his constitutional
rights in some way ... then I would agree that further delay would
be fair and reasonable,'' Van de Kamp told a news conference
Saturday. ``But Harris has received a fair trial and the most
painstaking federal review.''
   ``The Supreme Court has told us that they will take the case,''
Van de Kamp added.
   A spokesman for the high court confirmed the appeal had been
filed but declined to comment on whether or when the justices would
consider it.
   ``There is no legal or moral reason why the execution ... should
not proceed as scheduled,'' state Van de Kamp said in the emergency
appeal.
   Van de Kamp wrote that Harris' ``last-ditch, strained attempt to
attack the competency of his trial psychiatrists 11 years after the
fact ... demonstrates unjustified delay and an unconscionable
abuse'' of the appeals process.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court has turned down four of Harris' earlier
appeals and never ruled in his favor.
   Harris' arguments about inadequate psychiatric evaluation were
rejected Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in San Diego.
   If the appeals court decision Friday were allowed to stand, the
case would go to a three-judge appeals court panel. That panel
would decide if the federal court in San Diego should be ordered to
hold an evidentiary hearing on the defense contention on
psychiatric evaluation.
   Harris was convicted of kidnapping John Mayeski and Michael
Baker, both 16, from a fast food restaurant and shooting them to
death so could use their car in a bank robbery.
   Noonan's ruling angered and saddened the families of the victims.
   ``Where the hell is justice, quick and swift?'' said Bill
Stalder, the uncle of John Mayeski. ``This is tomfoolery. It's
playing a game, and it's shouldn't be. It's disgusting.''
   But death penalty opponents, some of whom have been fasting and
taking part in a vigil outside the gates of San Quentin prison,
were heartened.
   ``I'm glad that there is one good mind, heart and soul within
the 9th Circuit Court that said we need to think about this a
little more before we execute a human being in the state of
California,'' said Stephen Souza, a member of Amnesty International
and Death Penalty Focus.
   ``Surely we can think of something other than killing somebody''
for his crimes, said singer Joan Baez shortly before 300 death
penalty foes marched across the Golden Gate Bridge Saturday morning.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says She's Not Retiring</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tax Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
quashed speculation she might retire and told cheering supporters
of her Conservative Party Saturday that she still has ``the
stomach'' for the fight ahead.
   Despite a dramatic slump in popularity and the prospect of a
battle to succeed her, Mrs. Thatcher announced there was ``no
vacancy'' at 10 Downing St., the prime minister's official
residence in London.
   She spoke at a Conservative Central Council meeting in the
Gloucestershire town of Cheltenham about 100 miles northwest of
London.
   Protesters angry over a new local tax championed by the
Conservatives tore through central London Saturday afternoon,
hurling rocks at police, looting stores and terrifying tourists and
local residents alike. More than 130 people were injured.
   Mrs. Thatcher's speech came three days after the Conservatives'
former chairman, Norman Tebbit, announced he would run for the
leadership post if Mrs. Thatcher quit before the next election. The
vote must be held by mid-1992.
   Right-winger Tebbit's surprise announcement raised the
possibility of a leadership battle with former Defense Secretary
Michael Heseltine. He represents the party's center-left, and he is
the front-runner in opinion polls to succeed the prime minister.
   But on Saturday, Mrs. Thatcher made it clear she planned to lead
the Conservatives into the next election.
   ``To avoid any possible misunderstanding and at the risk of
disappointing a few gallant colonels, let me make one thing
absolutely clear: I haven't come to Cheltenham to retire,'' she
said.
   ``You may have noticed that I seem lately to have been subjected
to a certain amount of criticism _ not by the way for the first
time, nor I dare say for the last,'' she said. Criticism is ``one
of the perks'' of the job, she said.
   She told the party faithful to keep fighting to win ``a shining
future'' and assured them she was prepared to lead the battle. ``I
have the stomach for that fight. So do you _ and so I believe does
Britain.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's popularity has been eroded by rising inflation,
high mortgage rates and the new local tax being imposed across the
country.
   The opposition Labor Party had a record 28-point lead over the
Tories in the latest Harris poll last weekend.

   State police tried to negotiate their way
onto a Mohawk Indian settlement where they believe shots were fired
at a military helicopter, but Indian leaders insisted Saturday no
outsiders would set foot on their land.
   Both sides patrolled blockades on the four roads leading into
the Ganienkeh Mohawk Territory near the Canadian border. State
police set up the roadblocks Friday after a Vermont National Guard
helicopter on an emergency medical flight was hit by three bullets,
forcing it to land in a field on Indian land.
   A civilian doctor suffered a gunshot wound in the right arm, and
was listed in good condition.
   Authorities failed Saturday to persuade Indian leaders to allow
state troopers onto Indian territory to investigate the attack. But
both sides agreed to resume talks Sunday morning, said state police
Maj. Robert Leu.
   ``I don't think this will be long and drawn out,'' said Leu.
``We are very close to what we want to achieve, which is to
complete our investigation in the next couple of days.''
   Police have yet to identify a suspect.
   The Ganienkeh Indians, like other Mohawks in northern New York,
claim their land is sovereign territory and that federal or state
authorities lack jurisdiction there.
   Busloads of people normally travel on weekends to the territory
to play high-stakes bingo, but the games were canceled this weekend.
   The helicopter was flying at about 200 feet when it was fired on
at noon Friday, said state trooper Richard Garcia. Dr. James Van
Kirk, 27, was recovering Saturday at Vermont Medical Center in
Burlington, where he works.
   People aboard the chopper told authorities they believed the
shots came from the sparsely populated 700-acre Indian territory,
but police aren't yet certain that was the case, Garcia said.
   ``The determination is not clear yet,'' Garcia said.
   Daryl Martin, a spokesman for the Indians, insisted the shots
did not come from the encampment.
   Three military crew members and a civilian doctor and nurse were
aboard the UH-1 chopper, which because of weather had aborted a
mission to pick up a patient.
   The Mohawk roadblocks were set up beside police blockades to
keep authorities from coming onto the settlement, he said, adding,
``as long as their roadblocks stay up, we're going to keep ours
up.''
   A meeting Friday night between state police and Mohawk leaders
``turned out to be a total farce,'' Martin said.
   ``They just seem to be very hard-line, very hard-nosed and
insistent on violating our treaty rights,'' he said. ``We're afraid
of any type of invasion.''
   In Albany, FBI agent Wayne Alford said top priority was being
given to investigating ``the attempted murder of those on board the
aircraft.'' Any federal violations would be secondary to the state
police investigation of those charges, he said.
   FBI agents were at the scene but were not involved in the
negotiations, he said.
   ``The state police will do everything they can to resolve this
peacefully,'' Alford said. ``If it takes a long time to do that,
then we'll take a long time.''
   Indian leaders have been talking informally with state police at
the roadblocks, but some meetings have ``turned into yelling
matches,'' Martin said.
   The Indians made a few concessions Saturday. The allowed state
police to fly a helicopter over the area where the shooting
occurred, Martin said.
   The also admitted a crew to work on the crippled craft, and said
they would allow it to be flown away once repairs were finished,
Garcia said.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Saturday that ``people in the (Altona)
area have resisted Ganienkeh'' _ a suggestion that someone outside
the encampment may have fired the shots to discredit the Mohawks.
   When Cuomo was New York's secretary of state in 1977, he helped
negotiate an end to a three-year occupation by Mohawks of land at
Moss Lake, about 100 miles southwest of Altona. That agreement led
to the creation of the Ganienkeh encampment, where about 40 Mohawks
live on 700 acres.
   The Mohawks claimed the camp was among 9 million acres in New
York and Vermont wrongfully taken from them in the 18th century.
   Fifteen years ago, a 22-year-old man and a 9-year-old girl were
shot and wounded while riding in cars near another Ganienkeh
encampment, and the Indians also refused to cooperate. No one was
ever charged.
   The Mohawks at Ganienkeh, which means ``land of the flint,'' say
they are trying to protect ancient Mohawk traditions and culture by
living in a community that does not accept aid from federal, state
or county governments.
   Whites are not allowed onto the core of the settlement, though
Ganienkeh spokesmen said the bingo hall was opened in 1988 as a
means of raising money to build roads, a clinic and make other
community improvements.
   Mohawks have ignored restraining orders secured by New York
state authorities to close the 1,400-seat bingo hall.
   One leader said Ganienkeh residents will defend their encampment.
   ``If they are attacked or invaded, they will readily stand up to
the defense of their territory,'' said Kakwirakeron. ``They do not
allow New York state to exercise any jurisdiction whatsoever within
their territory.''
   Kakwirakeron, also known as Art Montour, is on trial in federal
court in Syracuse on a charge of impeding FBI agents and New York
State Police during a 1989 casino raid on the St. Regis Mohawk
Reservation along the New York-Canadian border.

   An anti-tax demonstration by 40,000 people turned
into a riot Saturday when militants pelted police with rocks and
bottles, set fires to cars and smashed shop windows in a rampage
through central London.
   It was the worst violence in Britain since 1985. At least 341
people were arrested, 58 police were hurt and at least 75 civilians
were taken to hospitals, police said. Many of the injured were
released after treatment.
   The worst of the trouble was over four hours after it began, but
sporadic vandalism and looting continued into the night. Some areas
of the West End shopping and theater district looked like
battlegrounds, and sirens and burglar alarms of vandalized stores
blared up and down the streets.
   For most of the afternoon protesters waved their placards
peacefully in marches and at a rally in Trafalgar Square,
denouncing the unpopular new so-called poll tax, which takes effect
Sunday.
   It will be levied by local governments on every adult in a
household and replaces a single household tax based on property
values. Under the new system, a duke in a 100-room mansion will pay
as much as a street sweeper in a cottage if they live in the same
borough.
   The tax has aroused anger throughout Britain and generated
widespread hostility toward Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But
she said Saturday she had no intention of retiring and that she
still had ``the stomach'' for the fight ahead.
   Clashes with police, on foot and horseback, began at about 3
p.m. near Mrs. Thatcher's residence on Downing Street, off
Whitehall, one of half a dozen streets that lead off Trafalgar
Square. The large plaza is in the heart of London, near Parliament,
the Thames River and the theater district. Mrs. Thatcher was not at
Downing Street.
   The trouble started when a breakaway group of several hundred
militants began a protest on Whitehall, south of the square.
   Police in riot gear joined 40 mounted officers to stem the
violence, but at least one officer was knocked unconscious as
protesters hit police lines with rocks from a nearby building site.
Other police officers and people in the crowd were hurt.
   Police on horseback sealed off Whitehall so it could not be
entered from the square, and demonstration organizers appealed to
thousands of people watching the tense situation to disperse via
the other side of the square.
   They refused, however, and continued to chant and wave anti-poll
tax banners.
   As the trouble grew, a fire broke out at a seven-story building
on Trafalgar Square, and police and a witness said it apparently
was started by a protester. Smoke poured out above the building,
undergoing reconstruction, before firefighters put it out at about
7:30 p.m.
   A group of about 60 young men ran along Regent Street, north of
the square, hurling trash cans and newspaper racks through the
windows of shops and arcades. Shop employees reported looting.
   Other rioters moved along St. Martin's Lane, which leads north
from the square, overturning cars near the English National Opera,
burning several and breaking windows of restaurants and shops.
   On Charing Cross Road, which also leads north out of the square,
more cars were overturned and set afire, and big garbage containers
outside restaurants were pushed over, spilling the contents into
the street.
   The trouble continued north to Leicester Square, the film,
entertainment and theater center of the city _ the busiest place in
London on a Saturday evening. Subway stations in the area were
closed.
   At Trafalgar Square, mounted police, pelted with rocks and
bottles, moved in to try to clear out demonstrators. At one point
about 1,000 protesters, chanting ``no poll tax!'' gathered in front
of The National Gallery on the north side, surrounded by mounted
police in riot gear and police on foot.
   ``The police tried to crush us from both sides from Whitehall.
People were in a panic. There were young children there and old
people, but the horses were stepping on anybody,'' said a student
who gave only her first name, Lara.
   But Iain McCallum of Surrey said: ``There is no doubt that the
police were being provoked. There were guys throwing bottles and
cans at them, shouting abuse. They just wanted to cause trouble.''
   When police forced the demonstrators out of the square by its
northwest exit, the mob surged up Haymarket, kicking in shop
windows. A McDonald's was badly damaged. Theatergoers and tourists
ran for cover as the mob used anything they could to smash windows.
   David Meynell, police deputy assistant commisioner at Scotland
Yard, said the march by 40,000 was ``completely overshadowed'' by
the violent actions of about 3,000 to 3,500 militants. He said he
couldn't name the groups but that there were black flags flying,
which indicated anarchists among the crowd.
   Legislator George Galloway of the socialist opposition Labor
Party, sitting sadly at the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar
Square, condemned the violence.
   ``To see sections of the crowd cheering on the rioters. It shows
the depth of hatred of this poll tax, and the extent of the
alienation in the country, and that disturbs me,'' said Galloway,
whose party opposes the tax.
   He said police actions were clearly retaliatory and frankly
necessary to save their own lives.''
   ``It was a well-organized demonstration, but these lunatics,
anarchists and other extremists, principally from the Socialist
Workers' Party, were out for a rumble the whole time, and now
they've got it, and if they didn't exist, the Tories would need to
invent them.''
   The Socialist Workers' Party denied it was responsible for the
violence and blamed police.
   Mrs. Thatcher Saturday told cheering supporters in Cheltenham,
about 100 miles northwest of London, that she had no intention of
retiring despite growing criticism and her dramatic slump in
popularity.
   She told the Conservative Party faithful to keep fighting to win
``a shining future'' and said she was prepared to lead the battle.
``I have the stomach for that fight. So do you _ and so I believe
does Britain.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's 11-year premiership has seen severe rioting,
mostly by young blacks protesting at unemployment, alleged
discrimination and police raids on drinking clubs and suspected
drug users.
   Saturday's London violence was the worst since September 1985,
when crowds of young blacks and some whites clashed with police in
the northern industrial city of Birmingham. Two Ugandan-born
brothers died there when their post office was burnt out.

   The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in a
fire at an illegal Bronx social club were loaded onto a cargo plane
at Kennedy Airport on Saturday for a late-night flight to Honduras,
a nation in mourning.
   At a brief memorial service in the huge hangar to which the
caskets had come, some in hearses, others stacked on flatbed
trucks, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said New York City would ``do all
possible to make sure this will never happen again.''
   ``These young people came to this great city of ours seeking
hope and opportunity, and now they leave like this,'' Lynch said,
gesturing toward the long row of caskets. ``The bodies lying here
before us say we've got to do more. We've got to do more to make
sure this doesn't happen again.''
   Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas planned to head a
government delegation receiving the bodies when the plane arrived
Sunday morning. After an airport Mass, Honduran air force planes
and helicopters will take the remains to 12 locations in the
country, said Nahum Valladares, Honduran information minister.
   In New York, police continued their crackdown on the hundreds of
unlicensed social clubs, or bars, which dot the city's poorer
neighborhoods.
   Police said they visited 261 locations late Friday and early
Saturday and found only 65 clubs open. They issued 29 orders to
vacate the premises, 57 summonses and 80 violation notices. On
Thursday night, they visited 89 club sites and found 74 closed.
   Most club operators closed down before they were shut down,
according to a neighborhood liquor store owner who has supplied
liquor to social clubs. He spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity.
   The retailer said that by Friday afternoon he had not heard from
any of the clubs that normally contact him during the day to place
orders.
   Because they are not licensed, social clubs cannot obtain liquor
from wholesalers and must buy from retailers. Such sales often
violate state rules limiting the amount of liquor any one person
can buy retail at one time.
   Their defenders say the clubs fill a need. Julio Medina, who was
at a Brooklyn club that was raided Thursday night, admitted that
the Bronx fire had worried him. ``But this is all there is,'' he
said. ``People cannot afford anything else.''
   A Bronx grand jury has charged Julio Gonzalez with murder for
allegedly etting the fire that devastated the Happy Land club a
week ago.
   Police say Gonzalez, enraged by a former girlfriend's rejection,
spilled a dollar's worth of gasoline in the entrance to the club
and set it ablaze. Conviction on a murder charge carries a maximum
penalty of 25 years to life.
   Gonzalez is being held in Bellevue Hospital, in isolation and
under 24-hour watch. The former girlfriend, an employee at the
club, was one of the few to escape.
   Six victims were buried Friday at St. Raymond's Cemetery in the
Bronx, and dozens of mourners attended a wake Friday evening for
three others. Other funerals were held Saturday before the airlift
to Honduras.
   The DC-8 scheduled to take the 50 bodies to Honduras was
chartered by the American Red Cross. Ed Hardy, a Red Cross
spokesman, said about 100 relatives of fire victims also were being
flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on regular commercial
flights.
   Hardy said an exact time for the cargo plane to leave Kennedy
had not been set. The flight takes about five hours, and the plane
was not slated to reach Honduras until after dawn Sunday.

<HEAD>West German Bank Pitches 2-1 Rate for East German Marks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank Saturday
recommended a 2-to-1 conversion rate for East German currency as
part of a plan to form an economic union between the two states.
   However, some members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing
coalition immediately attacked the proposal, and heavy criticism
was reported in East Germany as well.
   Critics said a 2-1 rate _ exchanging two East German marks for
every one West German mark _ would erode the life savings of
elderly East Germans and deny workers a chance to earn decent
wages. A 2-to-1 rate would mean that the salaries of East German
workers would be sliced in half.
   Bundesbank chairman Karl Otto Poehl announced the proposal in
Galway, Ireland, where he was attending a meeting of Economic
Community finance ministers. He told reporters he had outlined the
plan in a letter to Kohl on Thursday.
   The monetary union is considered a crucial early step in the
move toward German reunification. Some officials have predicted an
economic merger by the summer.
   The central bank proposal made an exception for small savers,
however. It specifies that East German accounts up to 2,000 marks
per person, the equivalent of about $1,175, should be converted at
a 1-1 rate.
   The concession was made because of promises by Kohl during the
March 18 election campaign in East Germany, Poehl said.
   Poehl argued that a 1-2 rate would in fact raise the value of
the East German mark, which currently is exchanged at the official
East German rate of one West mark for three East marks. However,
the currency is officially non-convertible and in reality has
little value outside the East bloc.
   There had been speculation that too favorable a rate would fuel
West German inflation. But Poehl predicted that East Germans, even
with West German marks, would be moderate in buying consumer goods.
   West German Finance Theodor Waigel, who attended the meeting in
Ireland, said he agreed with the Bundesbank proposal.
   Kohl was asked about it while attending a meeting of his
Christian Democratic Union in Neuss, near Duesseldorf. He said only
that he ``did not want to add to speculation'' about the exchange
rate.
   But the party's Social Committee chief, Ulf Fink, predicted that
limiting the 1-1 exhange rate to 2,000 marks would cause a new
exodus of East Germans to West Germany.
   ``Another exodus would be more costly than a general 1-1 rate
for all savings,'' he was quoted by the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung
newspaper as saying.
   The flood of thousands of East Germans westward played a big
part in prompting reforms that ended Communist rule in East
Germany. However, it put tremendous strains on West Germany.
   East Germany's economy is a shambles, and experts have predicted
that billions of dollars must be invested annually for the next
five to 10 years to modernize its industry, transportation and
other areas of the country's infrastructure.
   West Germany's economy, based on a free-market system, is the
most powerful in the 12-nation European Community. Many of the West
European currencies are closely tied to its mark.
   In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN said Saturday that
news of the central bank proposal had generated numerous complaint
calls to the Christian Democratic Union, the West German union's
sister party that won the March parliamentary elections. The party
campaigned for a quick monetary union to shore up East Germany's
economy.
   However, those calling the party offices Saturday said they felt
``cheated'' after voting for the party on expectations of a 1-1
exchange rate under monetary union, ADN said.
   In Bonn, Otto Lambsdorff, chairman of the junior governing
coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, said that accepting
the Bundesbank proposal would be like ``breaking a promise'' made
to the East Germans.
   In an interview with the weekly Welt am Sonntag newspaper in
Bonn, Lambsdorff said that because of very low retirement pay in
East Germany, most elderly people there relied heavily on savings
accumulated over the years.
   Lambsdorff was quoted by the newspaper as saying he also
rejected an overall 1-1 exchange rate.
   However, he acknowledged that the Free Democrats and the
Christian Democratic Union favored that rate for most savings
during the East German election campaign.

   A landslide-damaged petroleum pipeline sent
an 8-mile-long slick down the Allegheny River on Saturday,
threatening water supplies for more than 100,000 people,
authorities said.
   Fumes from the spill forced the evacuation of 100 people.
   Heavy rain Friday apparently caused the landslide that cracked
the pipeline the same day, said Ray Haase Jr. of Buckeye Pipeline
Co.
   About 75,000 gallons of a 50-50 mixture of diesel and heating
oil leaked into Knapp Run Creek, then flowed into the Allegheny
about five miles north of Freeport, said Haase. The creek joins the
Allegheny about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh.
   Monitors at Buckeye Pipeline's Allentown headquarters detected
the leak around 11 p.m. Friday when they noticed a loss of pressure
in the 10-inch-wide pipe, which runs from Linden, N.J., to the
Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis, Haase said.
   They cut off the flow of fuel about 20 minutes later. It was
unknown what time the leak began, Haase said.
   ``There may have been delays,'' he told an afternoon news
conference. ``It's not always an instantaneous decision to shut a
valve when the pressure drops.''
   Water intakes in Freeport were closed and residents were advised
not to drink tap water, said state Department of Environmental
Resources spokeswoman Betsy Mallison. Three tanker trucks brought
potable water to the city of 3,000 people Saturday night.
   Water intake valves also were closed in South Buffalo Township,
Harrison Township, Brackenridge, New Kensington, Tarentum and
Oakmont. The 101,360 customers in those communities were being
advised to conserve water, Ms. Mallison said.
   ``I wouldn't do my laundry today,'' she said.
   A few miles southwest of Oakmont, the Pittsburgh Water
Department planned to close its intakes early Sunday and rely on
reserves for water for its 500,000 customers, said spokeswoman
Donna Sagmeister.
   She said the intakes could be reopened as early as Sunday night,
and said no conservation order would be issued.
   ``It's not as serious as it could have been,'' she said,
explaining that the fuel would have to pass over three locks and
dams before reaching the city treatment plant. ``That mixes it up.''
   Thirty people from two cleanup companies hired by Buckeye began
cleaning up the spill at 4 a.m. Saturday, state police said. They
set up booms along the Allegheny, where an oily film covered the
shore at Freeport on Saturday night.
   Crews on docks in the city used absorbent pads to collect fuel,
but workers at the creek were hindered by mud from the landslide,
Haase said.
   ``It's a nightmare up there,'' he said. ``There's about 200
yards of road gone. The landslide area is so unstable and saturated
with oil, it's not physically possible for anyone to get in there.''
   Fumes from the pads during the afternoon forced the evacuation
of about 100 residents of a riverside apartment building for the
elderly in Freeport to a nearby elementary school, Mayor Bob
Ravotti said.
   At a news conference, state Fish Commission officer Jerry
Greiner displayed minnows and crayfish killed in the creek, a
popular fishing spot. Conservation officers were counting dead fish
and trying to determine if birds were affected, Greiner said.

   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
will head a government delegation receiving the bodies of Hondurans
killed in a New York City social club fire, the government said
Saturday.
   The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in the fire were loaded
onto a cargo plane in New York on Saturday for the midnight flight
to Honduras.
   The government said the bodies were to arrive Sunday morning in
San Pedro Sula, 120 miles north of Tegucigalpa. It has said 79 of
the people who died in last Sunday's fire at the Happy Land social
club were Hondurans.
   On Friday, Julio Gonzalez was indicted by a New York state grand
jury on 178 counts of murder, arson and other charges connected
with fire.
   Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, spilled gasoline in the
entrance of the illegal club and torched it after being rejected by
a girlfriend employed there, authorities said.
   Nahum Valladares, Honduran information minister, said in a
telephone interview that the bodies returned to Honduras will be
transported on a DC-8.
   The plane was chartered by the American Red Cross. Ed Hardy, a
Red Cross spokesman, said about 100 relatives of fire victims also
were flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on regular commercial
flights.
   None was aboard the cargo plane, and none attended a memorial
service at the airport in New York.
   The Honduran official said New York officials had also helped
arrange the special flight.
   ``The government this week has held intense conversations with
New York officials, who offered their facilities to repatriate the
dead and their families,'' Valladares said.
   Monsignor Jaime Brufau, the Roman Catholic archbishop of San
Pedro Sula, will officiate a Mass at the airport, and Callejas and
his Cabinet will attend, officials said.
   Valladares said Honduran air force planes and helicopters will
take the remains to 12 locations in Honduras.
   He said the bodies of some other victims would be brought back
to Honduras through private arrangements by their families. Six
victims were been buried in New York.

   A woman who recently suffered a
miscarriage killed a woman who'd just given birth and kidnapped her
baby, authorities alleged Saturday after arresting the woman and
recovering the infant.
   Betty Kirk, the 35-year-old mother of two pre-teens, pretended
the 10-day-old baby was her own, said Lee County Sheriff's Capt.
David Bonsall. Kirk was held without bond at the county jail in
Fort Myers on a charge of first-degree murder.
   The baby was taken to Lee Memorial Hospital. Her head had been
shaved, but she was healthy.
   The heavy-set Kirk had told friends she was pregnant, but
apparently suffered a miscarriage two months ago, authorities said.
   On Thursday, Sharon Parker, 33, was found dead in her Lehigh
Acres home by three of her four children when they returned from
school, sheriff's investigators said. Ten-day-old Julie Lynn Parker
was gone.
   Mrs. Parker, a casual acquaintaince of Kirk, had been shot once
in the back of the head, said Bonsall.
   Bonsall said it appeared that Kirk killed Mrs. Parker ``and the
only inference is that she wanted the child.''
   Kirk ``said she had given birth that morning, then showed her
family and other people the baby as being hers,'' Bonsall said.
   Friends found it odd she claimed to have given birth the day of
the slaying and abduction, then suddenly produced a baby who,
although small, didn't appear to be a newborn, said sheriff's
spokeswoman Sheri Peterson.
   Deputies found the infant at Kirk's North Fort Myers home late
Friday, along with baby clothes and other personal items belonging
to the Parkers, Bonsall said.
   Authorities had launched a ground and air search earlier in the
day for the baby.

   The fire began about 7 a.m. in the 1{-story brick building on
the city's North Side.
   Fire Chief Charles Dickinson said 35 cats and 39 dogs died,
probably from smoke and shock.
   Damage to the building was estimated at $250,000. The cause

   Lola L. Szladits, curator of the New York Public
Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature for 20
years, died Friday of cancer. She was 67.
   As curator, Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and
first editions and beseeched American authors to think first of the
Berg Collection when parting with their papers.
   A show on diarists Szladits mounted last year included 50 of her
famous authors like James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and
Herman Melville.
   Szladits considered the Berg a working collection used by
biographers from around the world, and expanded it to include
original manuscripts ranging from W.B. Yeats to S.J. Perelman and
Saul Bellow. Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's
handwritten notebooks.
   ``I am buying in eternity,'' she once said.

   Iranian-born Farzad Bazoft was hanged March 15 in Baghdad. The

The Observer.
   The Iraqi government said he spied for Israel after he visited a
military site where an explosion took place in 1989. Iraqi leaders
ignored international pleas for a reprieve.
   His body was returned to Britain.
   His brother, Afshan Bazoft, told mourners at the funeral
Saturday: ``Remember him as a happy man. Let him rest in peace.''
   The mourners at Highgate Cemetery included Donald Trelford,

   The burial followed an Islamic service at London's Central

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 Laval University students, angered by
steep tuition hikes, marched on the provincial legislature Friday
and tried to force their way into the building before being
rebuffed by Quebec riot police.
   Two students were arrested after they struck officers over the
head with their placards following protests over the proposed hike
in tuition beginning next September from an average of $540 a year
to $890 per year.
   The hike, agreed to by the provincial government, would be the
first in Quebec in 20 years. Quebec university fees are currently
the lowest in Canada.
   The demonstration was the latest in a series that has seen
students occupy the Montreal Exchange and interrupt a live newscast
on the French service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
   Besides the September increase, the following year university
tuition in the province is slated to rise by about the same amount,
making a total increase of about 140 percent.
   The students marched about three miles from Laval University on
the outskirts of Quebec City to the downtown building, chanting
``We want Ryan,'' referring to Education Minister Claude Ryan.
   Several of the students broke through police lines and tried to
enter the front doors of the legislative building. They were met by
club-wielding riot-squad officers who forced them back and arrested
the two.
   Later, the protesters threw snowballs at police before
dispersing.
   About 215 students have so far been arrested at fee-hike
protests, officials said.

   President Bush dropped in unexpectedly on a
Marine Corps officer-training class Friday and quickly assured his
audience as it snapped to attention that he mainly wanted to play
golf.
   No matter that it was cold and blustery out and had just stopped
raining.
   The commander-in-chief briefly toured part of the base before
leading a caravan of 11 golf carts that roamed over the base golf
course.
   ``I'm not pretending this is anything other than R &amp; R (rest and
recuperation),'' the president joked to about 180 attendees of the
Marine Corps Command and Staff College. ``I wanted to at least pop
in.''
   The audience, which included mid-level officers from the Marine
Corps and other services, had jumped to attention when the
president entered the room.
   He praised the military for its role in December's Panama
invasion and said, ``We never have been blessed with finer students
in all of our services than we are today.''
   ``Keep it up; the country is grateful,'' Bush said.
   The Marine base at Quantico sprawls along the Potomac River
about 30 miles south of the nation's capital.
   At one point, Bush, a World War II Navy torpedo-bomber pilot,
referred to himself as ``an aging, somewhat out-of-touch naval
aviator.''
   Bush said that ``respect for our armed forces around the world
has never been higher.''
   On the golf course, Bush was asked by reporters if he had
received a response to Thursday's letter to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the Lithuanian controversy. Bush raised his
golf club in the air and said, ``R &amp; R.''
   Later, on the 18th hole, he told reporters, ``What I said
doesn't, I don't think requires any answer.''
   After overshooting the 9th hole, Bush muttered, ``Oh, God,'' and
then said to the other players, ``I'd like to apologize for using
profanity on the last hole. I feel very badly about it and I don't
know what came over me.''
   Joining Bush for golf were his national security adviser, Brent
Scowcroft; his chief of staff, John Sununu; the Marine Corps
commandant, Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., and the base commander, Lt.
Gen. William Etnyre.

<TEXT>
   American Francis Foecke on Friday lost
his latest bid to clear his name in a four-year fight against
charges that he cheated in his final student examination at Bristol
University.
   But Foecke, 33, who comes originally from South Bend, Ind., said
he intends to keep fighting.
   ``If they think they are going to get away with it, they've got
it wrong,'' he said after the university's governing council
rejected his appeal.
   Foecke, who pronounces his name Faykey, said he will consult his
lawyers about taking the case to the Law Lords of the House of
Lords, the highest court in the land.
   The American reportedly has spent close to $200,000 in legal
fees and other costs contesting the university's refusal to give
him a degree in mathematics and computer science.
   He lives with his British schoolteacher wife Priscilla at
Clifton near the port city of Bristol, western England.
   ``I will never throw in the towel even if I have to carry on the
battle for the rest of my life. I want my integrity back. They have
not a shred of real proof against me,'' he said.
   ``The university has destroyed my whole life professionally. I
want a huge amount of compensation as well as an apology and a
degree.''
   The university refused to give him the degree in 1986, saying he
must have cheated.
   It said then that although he did first-class work in the
examination, he had been a poor student up to that time. It said
his answers in two exam papers bore a remarkable resemblance to the
examiner's model answers, including some of the mistakes.
   University Secretary Michael Parry said the council met for two
hours and resolved to dismiss Foecke's appeal after studying a
100-page report by an investigatory panel consisting of two
professors.
   The panel spent 16 days this year hearing Foecke, lawyers, and
staff at the university, which has 7,500 students.
   Foecke on Friday dismissed the panel's report as ``a load of
garbage.''
   ``There were similarities to some of the model solutions in my
answers. That is because the university is too lazy to rewrite the
exam papers. Sometimes the same questions crop up five years in a
row,'' he told reporters.

   The parents of Jessica McClure, the
toddler rescued from an abandoned well in 1987, are getting a
divorce, court records show.
   Reba ``Cissy'' McClure sued her husband, Lewis ``Chip'' McClure,
for divorce earlier this month, according to papers filed in a
Midland County civil court.
   The McClures could not be reached for comment Friday. A former
publicist for the family, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the couple filed for a no-fault divorce.
   The publicist said he had no other details of the divorce
filing, including the issue of custody of Jessica, who turned 4 on
Monday.
   Jessica was 18 months old when she tumbled into an abandoned
well in her aunt's backyard in October 1987. She was trapped 22
feet underground for nearly 59 hours while rescuers drilled a side
tunnel through solid rock to reach her.
   Her ordeal drew international attention and her rescue was
televised live by U.S. networks. A TV movie of the rescue aired
last May.

<HEAD>Brazil Inflation Soars to Record 84 Percent in March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil's cost of living rose 84
percent in March, its highest monthly increase ever, the government
said Friday.
   March inflation easily topped February's rate of 73 percent,
according to the official Brazilian Geography and Statistics
Institute.
   Inflation has increased 397 percent since January and 4,853
percent over the last 12 months, the institute reported.
   The March rate, calculated from mid-February to mid-March,
reflected the wild surge in prices preceding the inauguration of
President Fernando Collor de Mello, sworn in March 15 for a
five-year term in this country of 150 million residents.
   Transportation and communications pushed up the cost of living
more than any other item, jumping 94.83 percent during the 30-day
period. Personal items soared 92.37 percent and food 84.15 percent,
the institute reported.
   Collor, Brazil's first popularly elected leader since 1960,
announced the country's fifth and most radical anti-inflation
package a day after taking office.
   Price controls, a new currency, a de facto devaluation and a
crackdown on financial speculators were included in the plan.
   But the backbone of the package _ a severe tightening of the
money supply, hikes in taxes and utilities and a freeze on bank
deposits that totaled $115 billion _ have prompted mass layoffs and
fears of recession.
   Workers unions estimate more than 200,000 Brazilians have
already lost their jobs. In Rio alone, 11,000 people have been laid
off the last 13 days.
   Retailers have been offering easy credit and discounts as high
as 80 percent to entice cash-strapped Brazilians to buy goods.
   Some clothing stores are selling merchandise by the pound, car
dealers are bartering vehicules for rice and coffee and
supermarkets are now accepting credit cards.

   Retired army chief Gen. Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh became deputy prime minister and defense minister
Friday in a controversial move that students and critics called a
setback for Thai democracy.
   Chavalit took up the new posts under a command issued by the
country's constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, said
state Radio Thailand, monitored in Bangkok.
   Chavalit retired Tuesday as army commander in chief. He was
offered the Cabinet posts by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan,
who hopes Chavalit will help shore up a government destablized by
allegations of corruption, inefficiency and labor disputes.
   Chatichai yielded his defense ministry portfolio to Chavalit,
who also is now one of four deputy prime ministers.
   Radio Thailand said the deputy army chief, Gen. Suchinda
Kraprayoon, is the new army chief while the armed forces chief of
staff, Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, takes on the post of acting
supreme commander.
   Thailand has a long tradition of generals dominating politics,
but hopes for a new course were raised after Chatichai in August
1988 became the first prime minister in 12 years to also be an
elected official.
   Chavalit's moves to join the Cabinet prompted the Students
Federation of Thailand to renew calls for a constitutional
amendment requiring all ministers to be elected members of the
Parliament.
   Members of the federation staged a protest outside Government
House Thursday, holding up banners that called Chavalit a
``destroyer of democratic culture'' and chastized him for ``jumping
the queue'' to political power.
   The Thai media usually is timid in criticizing the military, but
The Nation, an independent English-language newspaper, stated its
views in a hard-hitting open letter to Chavalit published Thursday.
   It said: ``Many people are suspicious of your motives. Is this
your short cut to political power? ...
   ``Your going straight into the government will imply that either
a top army commander can always demand a seat of political power
almost at will, or that an elected civilian government cannot
survive without the support of the military, or both. Neither of
these bodes well for the political future of Thailand.''
   Chavalit was appointed army chief in 1986 when the then-prime
minister, Prem Tinsulanonda, fired Gen. Arthit Kamlang-ek for
publicly challenging the government.

<HEAD>Target the Weak, Memo Told Lincoln Bond Sellers</HEAD>

   Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan workers selling
``junk bonds'' were told, ``Remember the weak, meek and ignorant
are always good targets,'' according to papers in a court case over
the thrift's collapse.
   The advice was contained in a company memo that was among stacks
of paperwork filed Thursday by lawyers for holders of 23,000
uninsured bonds.
   The bondholders are suing to recover their estimated $200
million loss on the bonds, which are worthless because of the
collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association and its parent
company, American Continental Corp.
   The failure of the Irvine-based S&amp;L is expected to cost U.S.
taxpayers $2.5 billion.
   American Continental filed for reorganization under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last April 13, and the government
seized Lincoln the next day.
   Lawyers for the investors argued Thursday that seven civil
lawsuits stemming from the bond sale should be consolidated. County
Superior Court Judge David G. Sills didn't say when he would rule
on the request for class-action certification.
   Many of the investors were elderly people who lost their life
savings. They contend they were steered into buying the uninsured
bonds by Lincoln and American Continental employees who led them to
believe the securities were as safe as a federally insured savings
account.
   The memo, headlined ``Capitalize on This,'' was attached as an
exhibit to the paperwork arguing that the lawsuits should be
combined. It was unsigned.
   In addition to the advice about the ``weak, meek and ignorant,''
which was the last item listed, the memo also outlined other ways
employees were to make sales pitches:
   _``Hand out the brochure, track records and annual reports, but
do not hand out the prospectus or supplements.'' (Prospectuses
contain warnings about potential dangers of investments.)
   _``Use interest calculation ... on your computer. People are
blown away at how much more interest they earn in a bond.''
   According to court records, branch employees were told to stress
that the bonds were safer than stocks. One instruction said to
mention ``Black Monday,'' when the market dropped more than 500
points on Oct. 19, 1987.

   Two drivers escaped with minor injuries in
what is believed to be the first crash involving two cars equipped
with air bags, and Chrysler Corp. plans to film a commercial at the
site, an official said Friday.
   Two 1989 Chrysler LeBarons driven by Ron Woody and Priscilla Van
Steelant, both of Culpeper, crashed head-on March 12 on Virginia
Route 640.
   Both cars were totaled, but Woody and Ms. Van Steelant suffered
only minor injuries.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind the air bags saved them both,''
said State Police Trooper G.W. Dawson, who investigated the
accident. The cars were traveling at between 35 and 45 mph,
according to the accident report.
   Ms. Van Steelant was cited for failure to drive to the right of
center.
   Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said the crash is believed to be the first accident
involving two cars equipped with air bags.
   Beginning with the 1990 model year, all cars are required by
federal law to be equipped with either air bags or automatic seat
belts.
   All Chrysler domestic models are equipped with air bags.
   Jim Witherspoon, Culpeper County Chamber of Commerce executive
director, said Friday he has been contacted by IWS Productions, a
California firm commissioned by Chrysler to make a television
commercial about the air bag crash.
   Igor Stalew of IWS Productions said the company is waiting for
approvals to film the commercial at the site of the crash and will
have definite plans on Monday.
   ``It's an amazing demonstration of the way air bags can
protect,'' said Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for
the Insurance Institiute for Highway Safety. ``It's proof of a lot
of work over the last 20 years.''
   The institute is holding both crumpled cars in Fredericksburg,
where a crash investigation team will examine the speed of the
cars, the change in velocity, and other clues as to how the air
bags performed during the crash.
   Hurley said the institute plans to interview the drivers as part
of its investigation.
   When Woody and his wife, Kimberly, purchased their car last
November, the air bag feature did not enter into their decision,
they said.

   A conservative federal appeals judge has
blocked a murderer's execution in the California gas chamber,
leaving relatives of the killer's teen-age victims stunned and
disappointed.
   Tuesday's scheduled execution of Robert Alton Harris, which
would have been the state's first in 23 years, was stayed Friday by
Judge John Noonan of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
judge said more study of Harris' mental state may be needed.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp said he would ask the
U.S. Supreme Court today to lift Noonan's order.
   Harris was convicted of abducting two San Diego boys from a
drive-in restaurant in 1978 and fatally shooting them so he could
use their car in a bank holdup. Both victims, John Mayeski and
Michael Baker, were 16. Their bodies were found on a hillside
several hours after the bank robbery.

   President Bush says he doesn't expect Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to reply to his confidental message on
Lithuania, but just wanted ``to be sure the Soviets understand our
position'' on the rebellious republic.
   Bush said Friday that he had sent the message to Gorbachev on
the crisis to be ``sure there's no disconnect because of
misinformation.''
   ``Our views on the question of self-determination ... are
well-known around the world, but I do not want to risk
misunderstanding by failing to communicate,'' he told reporters
during a picture-taking session at the White House.
   Later, while playing golf at the Marine Corps base in nearby
Quantico, Va., the president was asked if he had heard anything
back from Gorbachev. ``What I said doesn't, I don't think, require
any answer,'' he replied.

   Idaho's anti-abortion governor says he
vetoed legislation that would have become the most restrictive
abortion law in the nation because it was flawed by outside forces
meddling in state affairs.
   ``We Idahoans are a fiercely independent group who will call it
as we see it,'' Gov. Cecil Andrus said. ``I have done that.''
   To out-of-state opponents of his Friday veto, he said: ``I would
respectfully suggest you return to your own states and try and do
it there.''
   In the past three weeks, more than 21,000 telephone calls,
letters and petitions have flowed into the governor's office. Calls
from out of state outnumbered those from Idaho residents by 3-to-1.

   The Bush administration, firing a new salvo in
a stepped-up campaign to reduce America's huge trade deficit, is
accusing 35 nations of erecting unfair barriers that block sales of
U.S. exports.
   A list released Friday focused on countries running large trade
surpluses with the United States, led by Japan, whose $49 billion
surplus accounted for nearly half of the $109 billion trade
imbalance last year.
   The Japanese took up 19 pages in the 214-page report, with the
alleged infractions running the gamut from prohibitions against the
sale of American rice to barriers against U.S.-made semiconductors.
   Other countries with a long list of alleged barriers were
Taiwan, Canada, West Germany, South Korea and China. All have large
trade surpluses with the United States.

   A jury will begin deliberating next week
whether John Poindexter did his best to give Congress the facts in
the Iran-Contra affair or engaged in what the prosecution called
``a rampage of destruction'' to cover up the scandal.
   In closing arguments Friday that followed three weeks of
testimony, prosecutor Dan Webb ridiculed the defense case and
criticized former President Reagan's bias in favor of his one-time
national security adviser.
   Poindexter destroyed a presidential document because it would
have exposed his alleged lies to Congress, said Webb. In November
1986, he said, the document was the one piece of paper that ``puts
the lie'' to Reagan's assertion then that there had been no trade
of weapons to Iran for American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``You don't lie to the American public,'' Webb said of Reagan's
speech.

<HEAD>Greyhound Strike Violence Goes Beyond Bitter Labor Relations</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The violently bad blood between Greyhound Lines
Inc. and striking drivers reveals more than just a sense of worker
desperation in a troubled money-losing business.
   It suggests the government has what amounts to a dual-standard
on safety for passengers who can only afford to take the bus.
   More than 200 incidents of violence have characterized the
month-old strike against the nation's only intercity bus service.
Union and management both have deplored the violence, which has
frightened thousands of riders away and left others wondering
whether they'll get shot, bombed or harassed.
   But federal officials haven't done much to stop it except seek
to restart contract talks.
   That attitude contrasts sharply with the stand on safety taken
by the government in other strikes where the public interest is
affected. Perhaps the most notable recent example is the year-old
walkout at Eastern Airlines.
   When that strike started, the Transportation Department warned
it wouldn't tolerate illegal impediments to mass transit, much less
violence. Some lawmakers urged federal intervention to delay the
strike, fearing the impact on their constituents. It's not
coincidental that most of the riders affected were business people,
commuters and vacationers along the affluent Eastern seaboard.
   The unions protested the limits on their picketing power but
obeyed. Passengers waylaid by canceled flights found seats on
competitors. Eastern now flies with non-strikers and replacement
workers.
   Greyhound riders, on the other hand, have little economic
influence, except perhaps on the balance sheet of the company, the
wayward interstate rest-stop concessions and the bus stop
candy-newspaper stands.
   They are for the most part poor or low-income, cash-paying
customers who can't pay the $120 for the 45-minute Northeast
shuttle ride from New York to Washington, the $300 one-way ticket
to Chicago or the $198 round-trip excursion fare to Miami.
   Many are going to places the airlines don't even serve any more,
a result of the deregulation era that began more than a decade ago
that has made Greyhound the only public way to reach large swathes
of America's heartland.
   To some labor-management experts, that makes it seem even more
incumbent on the government to guarantee the safety of Greyhound
riders. Some fault the Transportation Department for not taking a
more aggressive stand.
   ``I think the government position should have been stronger and
more forthcoming in getting the parties back to the bargaining
table,'' said Jerome Rosow, president of the Work in America
Institute Inc., a consulting concern in Scarsdale, N.Y. that
specializes in labor-management issues.
   ``This is a public interest strike where transportation is
affected,'' said Rosow, an assistant secretary of labor from
1969-71. ``There's a need to keep that flowing in terms of
passenger traffic. So it kind of appalled me as to why the
government was allowing the strike to continue in the early days.''
   Greyhound President Fred Currey has taken out full-page ads in
newspapers and ridden a few buses himself to at least symbolically
demonstrate his concern over the passenger safety issue. The
drivers union, historically accused by anti-union activists of
promoting violence, has called for prosecution of all
strike-related sabotage.
   To some extent, there is little the government can do to stop
the violence because of the nature of the bus business itself.
Putting police on every bus wouldn't deter people _ renegade
strikers or uninvolved bad elements _ from lobbing rocks or taking
sniper potshots from isolated overpasses on deserted highways.
   Even if the strike is settled, the Greyhound saga has aggravated
a festering labor-management dispute that many experts believe lies
at the heart of the violence, the right of employers to hire
replacements for strikers.
   Although both sides agreed last Thursday to resume talking, the
company has made its position clear on this issue.
   ``The company cannot and will not abandon those who are helping
it survive this senseless strike,'' Currey has said.

^Venerable Fine Arts Radio Station: Icon or Dinosaur?</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY ANDERSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most radio stations can hire and fire, switch ad
policies and conduct programming experiments without creating an
uproar. But not WFMT.
   WFMT has friends, and the Friends of WFMT won't stand for any
tinkering with the venerable fine arts station.
   The Friends are suing to protect WFMT's international
reputation, says Herbert Kraus, president of the 400-member
citizens' group that was rebuffed in the first round of its court
fight to prevent tampering with the station's ``unique character.''
   But the FM station may have to give up some traditions to
survive, say officials of WFMT, whose owners are under fire for
staff cutbacks, a revised ad policy and alleged mismanagement.
   WFMT, which turns 40 next year, has carved out a special niche
in broadcasting.
   The nation's first radio ``superstation'' in the late 1970s,
WFMT is heard across the country and around the world through
syndication and satellite relay.
   It produces broadcasts of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the
city's Lyric Opera and live performances elsewhere, as well as
in-studio concerts, talk shows and radio dramas. It has won
numerous awards, including more Peabody awards than any other
station.
   It also has a weekday talk show by Studs Terkel, Peabody and
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and broadcaster, who's been at the
station for 27 years.
   ``It is really the best fine arts-classical music station in the
country, probably in the Western world,'' said Leon Despres, head
of the Friend's legal team.
   ``It never sacrificed quality. It never used jingles for
advertising. It was just consistently interesting _ musically,
aesthetically. ... You just aren't bored by anything.''
   But WFMT's not for everybody.
   Local columnist Dennis Byrne says ``you can search the world
over and not find another station as stuffy.''
   Why does WFMT ``find it necessary to bore its listeners with a
Saturday afternoon of news from the BBC?'' Byrne asked in the Feb.
6 Chicago Sun-Times. ``What other station would find it more
important to tell its morning listeners about a lute recital ...
than expressway travel times?''
   Even Kraus concedes there are problems. ``Their share of the
audience has gone down, so they probably are doing some things
wrong. ... We're just concerned about the general character.
   ``Maybe there should be more music and less talk,'' he said. ``A
little stuffy? That could be true also.''
   WFMT's audience is aging and the station needs new listeners,
said Alfred Antlitz, the station's general manager.
   ``We're taking something that's very good and saying we need to
fix a few things to make it much stronger,'' Antlitz said.
   WFMT's programming goes beyond classical music to a fine arts
mix ``that our core audience is intensely loyal to, though it tends
to turn off people who just want background music,'' he said.
   WFMT _ owned since 1969 by the Chicago Educational Television
Association (CETA), which also owns local public television station
WTTW _ served for years as a model for commercial success in fine
arts broadcasting.
   But lately it has had trouble making ends meet, Antlitz said.
   Financial woes this year prompted the firing of eight of its
more than 40 employees, and a decision to accept pre-recorded
advertisements (``jingles'' to the Friends) for the first time in
WFMT history.
   ``It was the only station left in the country that didn't take
canned commercials,'' Kraus said.
   WFMT prefers announcer-read ads, but the policy cut into
potential revenues, Antlitz said, adding it was too soon to gauge
the change's impact.
   The Friends fear too many changes will reduce WFMT's audience
and revenues, prompting a decision to sell. Fine arts stations
elsewhere _ KLAC-FM in Los Angeles, for example _ have been turned
into more profitable rock stations, Kraus noted. Jazz stations also
have been scuttled in recent years, such as WRVR in New York.
   WFMT supporters would try to buy the station if it went on the
market, Despres said, but 98.7 FM would be worth ``easily $25
million'' as a commercial frequency.
   The Friends contend the station's financial problems began in
1986, when CETA replaced its independent management.
   Antlitz said CETA just ``wants us to excel ... and live within
our means.''
   The Friends lost the first round of their court fight Feb. 6.
Circuit Judge Albert Green ruled they had no standing to file their
lawsuit, which contends the donation of the station to CETA by WGN
Continental Broadcasting Co. made WFMT a charitable trust.
   The 1969 gift agreement notes CETA's plans ``to maintain the
unique fine arts programming of the station for the benefit of the
people of Chicago.''
   Green ruled that only the state attorney general's office could
seek a trust designation, but gave the Friends a month to offer
additional arguments.
   Despres said he was not optimistic, and the group will appeal.
   The lawsuit also contends WFMT was illegally deprived of $9
million in profits from the 1986 sale of Chicago Magazine, the
slick, lifestyle publication that began as WFMT's program guide,
for $17 million.
   Antlitz said the money is in an endowment fund that can be
tapped for capital improvements at WFMT.
   ``We're very much committed to the fine arts character of the
station,'' said CETA attorney Richard J. O'Brien Jr., but ``we're
committed to the station's economic survival as well.''
   The association denies the Friends' allegations, he said.

<HEAD>A Writer's Advice on His Craft: ``Unself Yourself''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Unself yourself,'' replies a grand old man of
English letters when asked for his advice to aspiring writers.
``Try for a moment to be the man you are listening to.''
   V.S. Pritchett, who will be 90 in December, has spent a lifetime
listening to other people and distilling their words into some of
the finest fiction, literary criticism and travel writing of the
century.
   He has published 40 books. A new collection of his travel
writing, ``At Home and Abroad,'' has just been published, as well
as a paperback of his biography of the Russian writer Anton Chekhov.
   Honors have flowed from British and U.S. universities, including
Harvard _ ``a terrific one and I'm very proud of that,'' he said.
In 1975, he was knighted for services to literature.
   ``Chekhovian'' is a description often applied to Pritchett's
deeply human, gently ironic short stories. Novelist Elizabeth Bowen
has called him the most important English practitioner of the short
story. The Times of London said of his travel writing: ``Everywhere
he slips unobtrusively into the life of the country and lets it
speak for itself.''
   The author himself says of his travel writing: ``I have
generally liked all the people I have met in every country. I did
not say what I thought. I did not reproach or criticize them. I
listened.''
   In his search for a character he'll listen to anybody _
salesmen, housewives, cab drivers, barflies, barbers and
bureaucrats. ``I knew from my own relatives that such people have
rich imaginations,'' Pritchett says.
   A passion for walking has helped. He never learned to drive, and
in his younger days he walked through France, Spain, Ireland, North
America.
   He still likes a stroll through Regent's Park, near the modest
home where he lives with his wife, Dorothy. He writes in longhand,
honing his stories through half a dozen rewrites.
   In the second volume of his autobiography, ``Midnight Oil,''
Pritchett wrote that when he went to live in France 70 years ago,
it was the ``beginning of a passion ... for identifying myself with
people who were not my own and whose lives were governed by ideas
alien to mine.''
   Victor Sawdon Pritchett had a chaotic boyhood. His father was a
disaster-prone traveling salesman and the family skipped from home
to home in the horse-drawn cabs of Edwardian London to escape
landlords and creditors. Thus, he called the first volume of his
autobiography ``A Cab at the Door.''
   ``It gave me a lifelong love of travel,'' he says with a smile.
``I wanted to be a writer. My grandfather put it into my head when
I was about 12.''
   From his mother he got the eye for detail that carries his
stories along so artfully. She wasn't ``a well-educated woman, but
she was a tremendous talker and could set a scene.''
   He left school at 15, wrote essays and accumulated rejection
slips. At 20, he moved to Paris to work in the glue trade. One
weekend he set out to walk from Paris to Orleans. His account got
published in London magazines.
   ``Americans are very good at reading everything, and when the
editor of the Christian Science Monitor visited Paris he insisted
on seeing me.'' The Monitor sent him to Ireland, where civil war
was raging, ``not to write about the war itself but about the state
of the people.''
   In Enniskillen he met a traveling salesman, an undertaker's son,
who made his rounds in his father's hearse. ``It fascinated me and
when I wrote it I discovered I had a gift for dialogue and a
feeling for common speech. It made me famous overnight when it was
published by John Lehmann in New Writing.''
   The story, ``Sense of Humor,'' tells of two lovers who are
pestered by the woman's jilted boyfriend. When he kills himself on
his motorbike while pursuing them, they are offered a hearse for
the journey home and drive off with the dead man's body in the back.
   Pritchett remembers being ``absolutely bowled over'' by his
meeting the Irish dramatist and poet William Butler Yeats in
Dublin. ``He had a marvelous, lofty manner, floating high above the
level of the ordinary world, and he was very kind to any young man.
He made simply marvelous speeches to me on any subject that came
into his head. He was quite an actor in himself.''
   Between the world wars he did a lot more walking.
   ``I didn't want to see the big cities and normal life,'' he
says. ``I wanted to see abnormal life. I had heard about the poor
whites in Tennessee so I went to see them in the Appalachians on
the border with North Carolina.
   ``I found one village which was absolutely incredible because
the people spoke a very strange English and a lot of them had names
like those in Elizabethan England. They were all Bible Christians,
very, very poor and very agreeable. You only had to knock on a door
and ask to stay the night and they would take you in and feed you.
I might sleep in one room with them, grandparents, parents and
children in beds all around the room.
   ``One old man of 93 told me his name was Pritchett, which is not
so common. He told me, `I fit (fought) in the Civil War.'''
   ``Country people were always surprised to find an Englishman on
their doorstep. It was the same along the Spanish border with
Portugal. When they asked what I did for a living I couldn't say I
was a writer because they wouldn't have understood as they never
saw a book. As I carried a camera I said I made picture postcards
and sold them. They were so poor they didn't have beds. They would
say, `Have you brought your sack?' and they would fill it with
straw.''
   Writing has taught Pritchett to suppress his own feelings and be
open to what other people say.
   ``I said to myself, I must observe this man and understand how
he works, why he works, what his attitudes and feelings are.
   ``I made a point of believing what I heard even though it was
fantasy, because it is part of a man's nature to have fantasies. It
has been said that too many of my characters are eccentric but they
are not really. They are people who are just speaking to
themselves.''

<HEAD>Running Against Women Gives Some Men the Blues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before his first debate with Susan Molinari,
House candidate Bob Gigante received an unusual warning from his
consultants: ``Whatever you do, don't make her cry.''
   Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask
George Bush.
   ``Remember 1984? I can't forget it,'' Bush said recently of his
vice presidential race against Democrat Geraldine Ferraro.
   The subject arose after Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee
for Texas governor, said he'd rather run against state Attorney
General Jim Mattox than state Treasurer Ann Richards. The two
Democrats are in a runoff April 10.
   ``I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman,''
Williams said.
   ``I know exactly what he means and I refuse to elaborate on
it,'' Bush sympathized.
   And no wonder. The political landscape is strewn with faux pas
by men _ mostly older ones _ more accustomed to thinking of women
in the kitchen than on the campaign trail.
   ``The men are nervous,'' says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
``Women running is just plain different and men sense it.''
   ``They are very confused,'' adds Republican pollster Ann Stone.
``The rules have changed very quickly over the last 10 to 15 years.
You've got to kind of feel sorry for them. ... Maybe their heart's
now in the right place but their mouth's not there yet.''
   Bush got himself in trouble six years ago when he boasted that
he had ``kicked a little ass'' in a debate against Ferraro. The
same race featured Mississippi agriculture commissioner Jim Buck
Ross asking Ferraro if she could bake blueberry muffins. ``Yes. Can
you?'' she replied.
   A few years later, men told women in Wisconsin and New Hampshire
that they shouldn't be running for Congress because they had young
children. One of the candidates, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
later apologized and called his statement ``just plain stupid.''
   ``There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to
be a little bit more chivalric, if that's the right word,'' said
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who is vying with
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
   Van de Kamp offered only one specific: he wouldn't punch his
opponent in the nose. But he still is taking a few swings at
Feinstein, including an attack ad that ends, ``Dianne Feinstein _
if she couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?''
   In contrast, Martha Layne Collins was elected governor of
Kentucky in 1983 ``in part because her opponents never could figure
out how to run against her. They never did point out anything wrong
with her,'' said Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman.
   ``Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like
a candidate and talks like a candidate, you treat it like a
candidate,'' added Hickman, whose clients include Van de Kamp and
Sen. Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat trying to fend off a
challenge by GOP Rep. Lynn Martin.
   Women like Martin and Richards, who have hired two of the
hardest-hitting media consultants in the business, are making it
easier for men to attack by proving that they can be as aggressive
as the next guy.
   They also are coming up with some deft responses to
gender-related missteps.
   Ferraro's good-natured comeback to Ross's blueberry muffin
question was considered ideal. Richards came up with a good
one-liner after Williams _ a self-styled symbol of the
free-wheeling, boot-wearing Texan _ confessed he wouldn't relish
running against her. ``Even cowboys get the blues,'' she said.
   Williams, 58, has been even bluer since he compared the bad
weather at his ranch last month to a rape. ``If it's inevitable,
just relax and enjoy it,'' he said. The incident created a furor
and Williams eventually apologized ``from the bottom of my heart.''
   Stone attributes Williams' remarks, both on rape and running
against women, to his generation and upbringing in Texas. ``His
lexicon hasn't caught up with the times yet,'' she said.
   But while men of Williams' age may not be used to competing with
women, many younger candidates like Gigante, 41, consider it
routine. The New York Democrat, who has four children and a working
wife, was surprised by his coaches' advice to be tough on Molinari
without making her cry.
   ``Why would she cry?'' Gigante asked. ``She's a mature woman.
She's held office. She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on
an issue just like I wasn't going to cry if she attacked me.''
   For the record, Molinari did not cry. She won the election and
was sworn in last week as a Republican congresswoman from Staten
Island.

<HEAD>Government Names Another Cupid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has established three separate
agencies to persuade people to get married, the function in most
other places of matchmakers, aunts and neighborhood busybodies.
   The latest is the Social Promotion Section, which organizes
social activities where school dropouts aged 20-35 can meet. About
150,000 of Singapore's 2.6 million people are in that category.
   ``I have to mix around with members and help them break the ice
between them with my personality,'' said David Chua, 35, head of
the new agency.
   ``I want to make them talk to each other. I have to see myself
as a matchmaker. I can't just sit back and watch, hoping they will
fall in love.''
   His agency plans to sponsor dances, barbecues, group travel and
courses in personal development.
   It joins the Social Development Unit, created by Dr. Eileen Aw
in 1984 for single college graduates, and the Social Development
Section, run by Sam Tan, which was formed the next year to promote
marriage among high school graduates.
   Early skeptics described the Social Development Unit as a
bureaucratic lonely hearts club for the ``single, desperate and
ugly.'' With the resources of the Ministry of Finance behind it,
however, the organization made steady progress in Singapore's
conservative society.
   A declining birthrate and charges of elitism prompted the
government to widen a matchmaking program that originally served
only civil servants with university degrees. Critics say it still
smacks of of discrimination, since the groups served are segregated
by educational qualifications.
   About 9,700 members belong to the original agency and it claims
credit for more than 570 marriages.
   At the end of last year, the Social Development Section for high
school graduates had 48,000 members and more than 7,280 former
members had married.
   Married women were caught trying to sneak into that group, so
the new Social Promotion Section will check up on applicants.
   The government created the first of its matchmaking bureaus
after Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in 1983 that Singapore might
be doomed by a deteriorating talent pool because too many educated
women remained single and childless.
   ``Levels of competence will decline,'' he declared. ``Our
economy will falter, the administration will suffer and society
will decline.''
   Part of the problem was that Singapore's men preferred to marry
women less educated than they, while women wanted to marry upward,
said Goh Chok Tong, the first deputy prime minister.
   Male college graduates had no difficulty finding wives, but
those with less education remained unmarried, he said.
   ``The more educated our people become, the fewer people they
want,'' Goh said. Singapore's birth rate has trailed the death rate
since 1974.
   In 1987, the government reversed itself on a successful birth
control program. It now encourages families to have three or more
children if they can afford it.
   A tax rebate of $20,000 ($10,695 U.S.) is promised to couples
who have a second child before the mother is 28. Similar
``procreation incentives'' are offered for third and fourth
children.
   ``Tax incentives cannot be taken by themselves,'' said Dr. Paul
Cheung, director of the Population Planning Unit. ``The support
infrastructure must also be provided to lessen the burden of child
rearing.''
   He said the number of government child care centers had
increased to 12,330 from the 6,086 of early 1987.

<TEXT>
   The financial wars may have produced no decisive
outcome yet in 1990, but they already have racked up an imposing
casualty list.
   As the first quarter of the year came to a close last week, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials hovered in the low to
mid-2,700s, right around where it stood at New Year's.
   To describe the January-March period as ``uneventful,'' however,
required a very short memory.
   You had to overlook, among other things, the abrupt collapse of
a prominent brokerage firm; a sharp decline in the supposedly
unshakeable Japanese stock market, and some serious disturbances as
well in the worlds of real estate and banking.
   Under the circumstances, some observers argued, the big news
about U.S. stocks wasn't that they seemed to be napping, but rather
that they hadn't fallen out of bed.
   One icon of the 1980s was smashed in February when Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the architect and prime tenant of the
junk-bond market, disappeared from the scene.
   Another was battered when the Tokyo stock market took a tumble
reminiscent of the 1987 crash.
   A painful reappraisal also continued for residential real estate
and other properties in some parts of the country where home prices
had been rising for most of the past three decades.
   The real estate ``correction'' has dealt a new setback to the
banking industry, even as the financial system was struggling to
rebound from a series of other disruptions.
   Regional banking stocks accounted for several of the first
quarter's biggest losers among individual issues traded on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   In a tabulation of stock performance for the year through the
middle of last week, Bank of New England, Crossland Savings,
American Savings Bank of New York and Unionfed Financial showed
losses exceeding 35 percent.
   The woes of Japanese stocks, meanwhile, raised new questions
about the vogue for international investing that made
single-country funds so popular in the late 1980s.
   Country funds that recorded declines of 30 percent or more
included the Spain Fund, Austria Fund, Korea Fund, Thai Fund and
Taiwan Fund.
   While stars like those were fading, traders found some
opportunities for profit in out-of-favor blue chips.
   International Business Machines was up 15 percent and General
Motors 13 percent to rank among the best performing components of
the Dow Jones industrial average in a mid-March tally by William
LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc.
   Another of the Dow's winners was Navistar, whose price of around
$4 ranks it as by far the lowest-priced stock in the average. It
was helped by conjecture about a possible improvement in the
depressed truck manufacturing business.
   If Navistar shares, which rose about 13 percent, weren't
speculative enough for your tastes, you could opt for the company's
class A warrants, which give their holders the right to buy the
stock at $5 a share any time before Dec. 15, 1993. The warrants
traded just above $2 apiece, for a first-quarter gain of more than
50 percent.
   American Express, down more than 18 percent, was the most
conspicuous laggard on the Dow roster.
   The company announced a deal to buy back publicly held shares of
its Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. subsidiary, abandoning a plan to
decrease its investment in Shearson.

   Digital audio tape recording _ the home taping
enthusiast's dream and the music industry's worst nightmare _
finally is here.
   With a protracted legal battle over this latest advance in
high-end recording potentially resolved, manufacturers are
promising to roll out their consumer DAT machines by summer, nearly
three years later than first expected.
   The recording industry, aware of statistics showing that four
out of 10 people over the age of 10 have taped recorded music in
the past year, is holding its breath. In DAT, the big guns in the
hardware industry are unleashing a product that threatens to do to
the humble audiocassette what tapes and fancy compact discs did to
the once-mighty vinyl LP
   ``It has the potential of doing what CD did in its initial
introduction into the marketplace'' _ or about 35,000 units in the
first year, said Paul Foschino, assistant general manager of
Technics, the Secaucus, N.J.-based arm of Japan's Matushita
Electric Corp.
   Matushita plans to introduce a DAT recorder in the United States
under the Technics label this summer at a cost of about $1,200 to
$1,300, Foschino said. The machines will carry a Panasonic label in
Europe and Japan.
   Philips Consumer Electronics plans to introduce a DAT machine
this year, and it also is developing a cassette that could be
played on both digital equipment and the analog cassette machines
already in use, according to the trade publication Audio Week.
   How well the pricey DAT machines fare with consumers is an open
question, but some analysts predict that, like CD players, the
prices will come down sharply when the new format gains popularity.
   A disturbing blip on the horizon for DAT manufacturers, however,
is the prospect of recordable-erasable CDs, which Tandy Corp., for
one, is developing.
   The imminent arrival of these digital technologies has revived
the debate over home taping and whether artists should be
reimbursed for potential lost sales. The money most likely would
come from royalty fees on blank tapes or recorders.
   A recent study by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment said home taping may be causing as much as a 22 percent
loss in prerecorded music sales. OTA said its survey in fall 1988
showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped recorded music in
the previous year.
   Songwriters, composers and music publishers claim that with DAT
they'll lose even more royalties as listeners make virtually
perfect tape copies of their favorite compact discs.
   But a bill pending in Congress to limit the number of copies
that DAT machines can make has eased concerns of record
manufacturers and cleared the way for introduction of the machines.
The bill codifies an agreement reached last summer in Athens
between the recording and manufacturing industries.
   Although the bill by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., does not
address the royalties question, the record industry considers the
measure to be a major step forward.
   David Leibowitz, senior vice president-general counsel of the
Recording Industry Association of America, says the group remains
``very committed to royalties.''
   ``However, we don't believe that royalties are politically
achievable at the present time, which is why we felt that we should
at least secure some protection,'' he said.
   But the artists who create the songs aren't satisfied. They
question whether or not the new anti-copying technology is
tamper-proof and say that even limited copying cuts into their
business and will lead, ultimately, to fewer recordings being made.
   ``We want the technology to move forward, but the question is
will it allow us to make a living and will consumers have product
available,'' said Ed Murphy, president of the National Music
Publishers Association.
   Opponents of fees on blank DAT tapes or recorders claim such a
royalty system would be unfair to those who don't use the tapes to
record music.
   ``If you want to tape your child's first words, why should you
pay Michael Jackson for that?'' said Ed Baxter, chief counsel to
the Senate Judiciary patents, copyrights and trademarks
subcommittee.
   It is still uncertain how the DAT bill will fare this year in
the House in a session shortened by election-year politicking and a
major clean air bill that is tying up the Energy and Commerce
Committee, where the bill resides.
   ``I don't think it's a terribly controversial issue, but it's
just a question of whether there's enough time,'' said one
congressional aide who would not allow his name to be used.
   To the recording industry, the scary part about DAT, which uses
the 1s and 0s of computer language to make exact duplicates of the
source material, is that as many as 20 generations of digital
copies can be made without discernible loss of quality.
   Faced with the threat of runaway home copying, which copyright
law generally has declared to be legal ``personal use,'' the RIAA
in 1987 threatened to sue any manufacturer that introduced a
consumer DAT model before copyright issues could be addressed.
   The Athens agreement settled the legal question _ for now _ by
instituting the Serial Copy Management System. SCMS will allow one
DAT copy to be made from a copyrighted CD, but the user cannot make
a copy from the DAT copy. It would allow a CD to be copied
indefinitely onto different blank DAT tapes.
   The system also limits to two the number of generations of
copies that can be made from a non-digital source, such as today's
``analog'' audiocassettes, LPs or radio broadcasts. One copy of a
copy could be made from analog sources.
   SCMS uses a silicon chip that will be able to detect an
electronic anti-piracy ``flag'' that is placed on a copyrighted
digital material such as music CDs. The chip will ``write'' this
flag onto the first DAT copy made from the CD. If a DAT recorder
detects this flag, its record function will not operate.
   Professional DAT machines, without SCMS, already are in use in
the United States in the recording, broadcast and computer
industries _ at hefty prices ranging from $2,500 to $7,000. ``Gray
market'' consumer models can be had for $1,600 to $3,000.
Automobile DAT players have been available for more than a year at
$1,500 and up, with some prerecorded DAT tapes _ mostly classical
and jazz _ available at about $25.
   DAT tapes, which are about half the size of conventional
audiocassettes, can store as much as two encyclopedia's worth of
data, much more than conventional cartridges used for backup
computer storage. DAT tapes could be useful as backups to hard
discs on personal computers.
   DAT machines work something like a typical videocassette
recorder. A mechanism inside the DAT machine opens a door on the
back of the DAT cassette and draws the 1@3-inch-wide tape around a
spinning record-play drum. The recording is accomplished at the
dizzying speed of 123 inches per second _ 65 times faster than
today's audiocassette deck.

   There's still life left in ``70, Girls, 70,'' a
star-crossed Broadway musical.
   A charming song and dance about a group of old theater folk who
steal furs to save their apartment hotel, the musical opened in
April 1971 and barely lasted one month. Now, nearly 20 years after
its New York premiere, ``70, Girls, 70,'' is getting a second
chance.
   In February, a revised version opened in Sarasota, Fla., as part
of the inaugural season at the opulent new Asolo Center for the
Performing Arts. It runs there through April 11.
   In July, the show will be done at the Chichester Festival in
England with British musical-comedy star Dora Bryan in the role
originally played on Broadway by Mildred Natwick. Other American
regional theaters have also expressed interest.
   The original production had more than its share of problems. It
went through several writers and a director or two.
   But there were other factors that contributed to its short run.
The show faced stiff competition that season from more high-powered
musicals with similiar themes such as ``Follies,'' and from ``No,
No, Nanette'' and ``Two by Two,'' which also featured older stars.
And most importantly, its leading man suffered a heart attack and
died during a tryout performance in Philadelphia. ``70, Girls, 70''
never fully recovered.
   ``I guess every time you fail, you like to give it another
shot,'' said Fred Ebb, who wrote the show's lyrics and collaborated
on the original book. ``You wish six strikes were out instead of
three. I always harbored a notion to do `70, Girls, 70' again.''
   Over the years, Ebb and his partner, composer John Kander, the
men who wrote ``Carbaret,'' ``Chicago'' and the upcoming ``Kiss of
the Spider Woman,'' have been asked by regional theaters for rights
to the show.
   ``We were reluctant to do it in the original way since that had
proven unsuccessful,'' Ebb said.
   They called on David Thompson, a young writer who had redone the
book for ``Flora, the Red Menace,'' another Kander and Ebb musical
that resurfaced successfully at the tiny Vineyard Theater in New
York and the Pasadena Playhouse in California.
   The changes between 1971 and 1990 in ``70, Girls, 70,'' were
mostly in the structure of the show, Ebb said, rearranging story
and songs. The lead character, Ida, became the narrator who
clarifies the story line and introduces the audience to the various
characters.
   ``The problem with `70, Girls, 70' which I'm sure will be
constant if we're lucky enough to have further productions, is
always in the casting,'' Ebb said. ``It's very hard to get people
of the correct age to play this and particularly if it's far away
from their homes, if it's eight performances a week and if it's for
an extended period of time.
   ``Eddie Foy Jr., was to be have been in the original production
and we were rehearsing in the winter. He was staying at the Lambs'
Club. Between walking to the theater where we were rehearsing and
the Lambs he would almost get frostbite. He was chilled to the
bone. He said, `Fellas, I can't do this anymore.' He would have
been wonderful.''
   More devastating was the death on stage in Philadelphia of David
Burns, the veteran comic actor who had appeared in such shows as
``The Music Man'' and ``Hello, Dolly!''
   ``Davey died during a scene where everybody on stage is trying
to act `old' and a little crazy,'' Ebb recalled. ``In fact, he was
having a heart attack. It seemed part of the show. He fell to the
floor, and it got a laugh. It was right in keeping with the style
of that particular scene.
   ``Stagehands came in and dragged him off. The audience didn't
even notice. He died in the wings. It was an awful experience. We
all just sat around and cried for a couple of hours.
   ``Davey was much beloved by the company, and I think what
happened frightened many of our performers of the same age. To see
someone they were friends with and were working with just die in
front of them was terrible.''
   After Burns' death, the show had to cut short its engagement in
Philadelphia where it had received very good notices and was doing
very good business.
   ``We couldn't afford to stay there because we had to come to New
York and find a replacement,'' Ebb said.
   In New York, the musical opened less than two weeks after
``Follies,'' the landmark Stephen Sondheim musical that received an
enormous amount of attention.
   ``In many ways, `Follies,' was about elderly people, too, or at
least middle-aged ones coming to identity crises and how they dealt
with it,'' Ebb said. ```Follies' was opulent and beautiful and
very, very expensive. We were like a little show that has banged
together out of spit, good will and nails. I don't think that
comparison helped us very much either.''
   The score, preserved on the Columbia original cast album, always
has been a favorite among theater buffs, and at least two of its
songs, ``Yes,'' championed by Liza Minnelli and ``Coffee in a
Cardboard Cup,'' done by Mandy Patinkin, have had a popularity
outside the show.
   The Chichester production will be directed by Paul Kerryson who
staged the first British production of ``The Rink,'' Kander and
Ebb's last Broadway show. But he will have an American eye looking
over his shoulder. Ed Aldridge, who was the stage manager on the
original production of ``70, Girls, 70,'' will travel to England to
consult on the show.

<HEAD>Hot Money Headed For U.S. Markets?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As they look for potential winners in the
international investment derby of the early 1990s, some analysts
are touting a recent also-ran by the name of the United States.
   The idea isn't exactly a novel one, given the sheer size of the
U.S. economy and its powerful influence on world politics.
   But it still represents something of a switch from the trend in
recent years, when investment funds in search of the most glamorous
growth opportunities often headed for other points around the globe.
   Until fairly recently, the most obvious magnet for money was
Japan and its Pacific Rim neighbors.
   Then the rush was on to European markets, encouraged by the
toppling of long-time Cold War barriers and the prospect of a new
economic order in 1992.
   If you were in a mood to pick long shots, many experts looked
toward businesses in smaller industrialized countries or the Third
World.
   When big players operating on a global scale contemplated U.S.
investments, they most often thought in terms of safety, stability
and liquidity rather than a chance at a big score.
   American merchandise meant Treasury bills, bonds and notes _
still regarded as one of the safest high-yielding investments
available anywhere _ and blue-chip stocks.
   In a new decade, however, some observers argue that events may
be conspiring to put some glamor back into the image of the
American markets on the computer screens of trading rooms around
the world.
   Japan, for its part, has seen a wrenching decline in its markets
amid worries over high interest rates and even higher
price-earnings ratios.
   There are signs, as well, that stocks in West German and other
European markets may be undergoing at least a temporary setback
after soaring on heady expectations there.
   ``Developments that cast a shadow of doubt over Western Europe
could make the United States the ray of sunshine in a world
darkened by uncertainty,'' says Greg Smith, analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``Even if the United States does nothing particularly clever,
but simply continues to be viewed as a place of predictable ongoing
opportunity, the U.S. market could become the hot spot later this
year _ by default.''
   American stocks staged a modest advance in the past week,
closing out a generally inconclusive first quarter of 1990. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.93 to 2,707.21, cutting its
loss to 45.99 points since New Year's.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up 1.40 at 186.85; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market down 1.71 at 435.54, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 0.14 at 361.75.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 132.31 million shares a day,
against 151.72 million the week before.
   Over the past couple of months many analysts have been impressed
with the steady showing of U.S. stocks while the Japanese market
tumbled. But not everyone is ready just yet to declare this a clear
victory for bulls on the United States.
   ``Japan Inc., probably the greatest cartel of the postwar world,
is falling apart and the ramifications, both good and bad, are
unknowable,'' said Barton Biggs at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``In the
short run some of the ripples may turn into waves that swamp some
innocent boats.''
   Added David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc.: ``The wealth lost in the plunge in Japanese
share prices is so mind-bogglingly large that it is easy to fret
over a potential spill-over into other markets.
   ``Consider this: The more than 20 percent drop since the
beginning of the year has erased something on the order of $800
billion to $900 billion of wealth from that market. That's roughly
double the wealth lost in the U.S. markets during the October 1987
crash.''

   The question is simple. It wouldn't stump a
child. But for the people in this bright room, nothing is simple.
   ``What do you call two pieces of bread with something in
between?'' the therapist asks eight, mostly young adults.
   A young woman eagerly raises her hand. ``A sandwich,'' she
answers.
   Nearby, another therapist holds a piece of white cardboard with
the word ``January'' written in large black letters in front of a
young man in a wheelchair. His head is slumped forward, as if he
were dozing.
   In a large dining room, Sam Been sits at a baby grand piano,
playing one of the tunes he composed during 18 months at the New
Medico Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center, which specializes
in the treatment of head injury victims.
   Been and the others at New Medico's Troy facility are among tens
of thousands of Americans who each year suffer debilitating head
injuries. Many will need specialized care and rehabilitation the
rest of their lives.
   The federal Department of Health and Human Services in 1988
established a task force to address the needs of people with head
injuries. The task force found most medical, legal and social
systems ill-equipped to deal with victims of traumatic brain injury.
   And its report, issued last year, said the medical and legal
costs and related economic losses for head injury victims approach
$25 billion per year.
   Among the task force's recommendations to the House and Senate
appropriations committees were encouraging the establishment of
state and local head injury groups to provide leadership and
coordination, and creation of a national network of regional head
injury research centers.
   Some of the recommendations are being followed. For example,
Westchester County Medical Center is establishing a regional head
injury ``care manager'' program to coordinate services.
   The National Head Injury Foundation calls head trauma a ``silent
epidemic.''
   ``Jerry Lewis isn't out there pushing for head injury
children,'' said Dr. Samuel Kasoff, chairman of the neurosurgery
department at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla.
   The foundation estimates that more than a million people suffer
some degree of head trauma each year. Some 100,000 die from their
injuries. Of those that survive, 70,000 to 90,000 are left with
impairments that prevent them from living normal lives.
   Motor vehicle accidents account for more than half the head
injuries, according to the NHIF. Twenty percent are caused by
falls, 12 percent by violence, and 10 percent are suffered during
sports or recreation activities.
   Increased use of helmets and seat belts and better emergency
medical treatment have resulted in more people surviving head
injuries, said trauma surgeon John B. Fortune.
   ``We're a mechanized, mobile society. We go very fast and get
into accidents. Unfortunately, one of the organs that gets injured
a lot is the head,'' said Fortune, director of the Northeastern New
York Regional Trauma Center at Albany Medical Center Hospital.
   With more survivors, demand grew in the 1980s for rehabilitation.
   ``Ten years ago when we were formed there were about five rehab
facilities like New Medico. Now there are about 600,'' said Silvana
Guerci-Lena, spokeswoman for the NHIF, a Southborough, Mass.-based
advocacy group.
   For victims of severe head injury, rehabilitation can be long
and painful, with no guarantees.
   When Been arrived at New Medico on Sept. 1, 1988, six weeks
after a car accident, he could not walk or talk. He suffered memory
loss and became easily distracted and agitated, common symptoms of
traumatic brain injury.
   ``There's parts of my life I don't remember,'' he said. ``It's
hard. I used to cry a lot. Then I make the best of what it is, and
say, `Thanks, let's go on.'''
   About 50 head injury patients, ages 16 and older, occupy New
Medico's two floors, said spokeswoman Kathryn Rockenstire. A nearby
center opened in 1989 and specializes in treating children.
   With 38 facilities nationwide, New Medico is the nation's
largest provider of head injury rehabilitation. Costs start at $375
per day and go as high as $950 per day, depending on the extent of
the rehab program. Considering the average stay at New Medico is
seven months, the total could reach $199,500.
   ``A lot of people can't even get into these facilities because
their insurance doesn't cover them to be there,'' said Guerci-Lena.
``Their insurance covers them to be in a nursing home for the rest
of their lives.''
   There are less expensive facilities. New Medico's rehab centers
stress ``gracious living,'' Rockenstire said. At Troy, English
hunting prints and oriental art decorate the walls. Visitors sit in
thick leather chairs and sofas in the lobby. In a lounge decorated
with Queen Anne furniture, coffee is offered from a silver serving
set.
   ``New Medico's philosophy to give it a home atmosphere, not an
institution,'' Rockenstire said. ``We want this to be a place where
family members can feel comfortable.''
   The goal of head injury rehabilitation is to get the patient
back home, back to work and contributing to society. Though he was
looking forward to going home, Been kept his excitement in check.
He knows the bitterness of setbacks.
   Been, whose insurance paid for his New Medico stay, was
discharged last month, and has returned home to the Bronx with his
wife, Rockenstire said. He has the potential to return to work, but
will need retraining and rehabilitation, she said.
   Before the accident, Been was a 24-year-old security guard. None
of the three other people in the car suffered a scratch.
   ``I didn't even break a nail,'' Been said. ``I said to my wife
later, `Honey, didn't I even break something?'''
   Five months after he arrived at New Medico, Been was walking,
and uses a crutch he is expected to be able to discard one day. But
like most head injury victims, there are memories that are lost to
him, possibly forever.
   An avid guitar player before the accident, Been found he could
no longer play because of neurological damage to his brain. Like
many head trauma victims, Been's brain messages ``misfire,''
causing muscle spasticity, or contraction, that can severely twist
limbs without therapy and braces.
   Been turned to the piano, partly to relieve boredom and also
because the physical coordination and concentration needed to play
proved to be good therapy.
   Been played for some Cub Scouts his first Christmas at New
Medico, and they returned last Christmas wondering if he would play
again.
   ``I was like, `Christmas, humbug!' '' Been said. ``I was HERE. I
wanna get out of HERE.
   ``So they came, and they touched my heart. They touched my heart
so gently,'' he said, smiling. ``Then they had me saying, `Hey,
merry Christmas.'''

<HEAD>Credit Quality Problems Spread in the Municipal Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The downgrading of New York State's long-term
credit rating has shown that the problem of deteriorating credit
quality isn't confined to the much-maligned junk bond market.
   Citing concerns about stalled negotiations to close a widening
budget deficit, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. last week dropped its
rating on the state's long-term general obligation bonds by two
notches to single-A. It also gave a lower rating to a new state
short-term financing.
   The move left New York with the third-lowest rating among the
states, ahead only of lowly Louisiana and Massachusetts.
   The long-term downgrade applied only to $3.9 billion in bonds
outstanding, but the move carried big implications for the $700
billion municipal bond market.
   About 10 percent of the outstanding bonds in the market come
from New York or various municipalities, school districts and other
entities in the state, including New York City. Most of those
entities depend on the state for a large portion of their revenues,
so cuts in the state budget could hit them hard.
   ``Even if there's some modest adjustment, every school district
in the state theoretically could be affected,'' said Bob
Chamberlain, head of municipal research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The downgrade didn't have a big initial impact because the
state's problems _ including a recession in its key financial
services industry and sluggishness in tax receipts _ have been
increasingly evident in recent months.
   ``There's been a downtrend over the past six to eight to 10
months,'' says Neal Atterman, director of municipal research at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Still, the rating change forced the state to pay about 10 basis
points more in yield to sell $775 million in tax and revenue
anticipation notes to help close its budget gap, estimates Mike
Delaney, a partner in the municipal bond department at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. The firm underwrote nearly half last week's issue.
   The budget pressures facing New York are intensifying across the
Northeast, where sluggish economic growth and a weak real estate
market are crimping state revenue growth.
   Lawmakers in Massachusetts have been struggling to get the
state's finances in order for more than a year. Standard &amp; Poor's
recently lowered its ratings on Connecticut's long-term debt by one
notch to double-A because of ``recurring budgetary problems.''
   Hyman Grossman, managing director in charge of municipals at
S&amp;P, says weakness in the economy has led to shortfalls in personal
income tax and corporate tax receipts in New York.
   His suggestion: a 10 percent income tax surcharge that would
raise about $1.5 billion, perhaps enough to close the budget gap
for the year that began Sunday. That's tough medicine in these
political times.
   But, Grossman says, ``When it comes to basic fiscal integrity,
politics has to be shunted aside.''
   George Leung, managing director of state ratings at Moody's
Investors Service Inc., says that while the state's economy causes
some underlying concerns, the main problem now is getting New
York's legislative leaders and Gov. Mario Cuomo to agree on real
measures to cut the deficit.
   ``There's certainly an ability here, they just have to deal with
the problem,'' he said.
   Although most attention has focused on the Northeast's problems,
less severe cash shortages are evident elsewhere, including
Southeast states like Florida, Georgia and Tennessee, says Atterman
of Kidder Peabody.
   Many states are suffering from changes in federal government
policy in recent years that have imposed increased spending
requirements on the states while reducing federal aid at the same
time.
   ``The number of states and the variety of states ... that are
either expecting a deficit or are having cash difficulties is
rather startling,'' he sas.
   ``I think very gradually there's been some concern'' about a
worsening of credit quality in the municipal market generally, says
Delaney of Goldman, Sachs. ``You saw it in the junk market, you saw
it in the corporate market and you're seeing it in the municipal
market.''
   The deterioration hasn't pushed up bond yields that much to date
because of a dearth in the volume of new issues, Atterman says. The
pace of new issues is off about 20 percent so far this year, in
large part because a rise in interest rates generally has
discouraged some potential borrowers.
   Nevertheless, ``if and when we do see more volume in the market,
we're going to see increased differentiation'' in yields between
different credit risks, he says.

<HEAD>Bayou Celebration Planned For First Natural Gas Futures Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When natural gas futures begin trading for the first time ever
on Tuesday, the focus will be on the trading pit at the New York
Mercantile Exchange but the ceremony will be in the Cajun prairie
town of Erath.
   Nymex chose Sabine Pipe Line Company's gas interchange center
south of Lafayette in the Louisiana bayous as the designated
delivery site for all futures contracts.
   The first contract was to be delivered to Sabine's facility in
the town of 2,100 during Tuesday ceremonies attended by officials
of Nymex and Sabine, a subsidiary of Texaco.
   The Erath facility is a pipeline that transports gas from
Louisiana, Texas and the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Louisiana is the leading natural gas producer in the continental
United States and a majority of the state's large pipelines pass
through the jungle of pipes at Erath.
   ``The selection of Louisiana as the futures delivery point
affirms Louisiana's role as a leader in the natural gas field,''
said Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   Natural gas producers hope the move will have the same kind of
effect on the industry as oil futures trading did once it began in
1978. Since then, Nymex trading largely has fixed the price of oil,
even in the face price-setting strategies by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``The oil industry has benefited from futures trading and the
gas people are hoping for the same thing,'' said Ron Gomez,
secretary of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.
   A futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell a prescribed
quantity of goods to be delivered at a future date at a price
agreed upon in advance.
   Both producers and consumers use futures as a hedge against
fluctuating prices, buying or selling them to lock in the prices at
which they buy or sell raw goods, eliminating some of their
financial risk.
   ``It can work the same way for gas,'' said Vic Tompkins of the
Louisiana Mineral Resources Division. ``But, remember, the futures
market involves a lot of gambling. The pit can be like a casino.''
   In addition to those wanting to hedge against price
fluctuations, futures attract speculators who buy contracts
essentially to gamble on future price movements.
   The trading of natural gas futures, which first was proposed to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1984, reflects the
enormous growth in the spot market for natural gas as federal price
controls have been lifted.
   Deregulation of the natural gas market began in 1978, and
remaining price controls will be lifted by 1993.
   Nachamah Jacobovits of Nymex said the exchange doesn't expect as
much speculative dealing in gas as there is in oil. That's why
Sabine is excited about its Henry Hub center in Erath.
   The contract with Nymex ``will assist Sabine in achieving its
goal of making the Henry Hub the premier location for trading
natural gas in the United States,'' said Jagjit S. Yadav of
Houston, president of the pipeline company.
   ``We believe that futures contract trading will encourage the
development of a more efficient natural gas market and be of
benefit to the natural gas industry and its customers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Getting Wise to the Claims About What's Environmentally Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Products that claim to be degradable,
recyclable, dioxin-free, phosphate free and ozone-friendly now span
everything from toilet paper to baby food, available everywhere
from mail catalogs to Wal-Mart shelves.
   But as Mobil Corp. and other manufacturers have discovered,
shrewd environmentalists and government regulators are starting to
do something about what they see as healthy-planet hype.
   Mobil announced this past week it was deleting the word
``degradable'' from labels on its Hefty trash bags. The company
took the action because of what it called growing confusion about
what degradable means.
  bil's decision came after a task force of
attorneys general disclosed it was investigating Mobi Nonetheless, Mol
and several
consumer products companies over allegations of misleading
advertising.
   The investigation stemmed partly from concern raised by the
Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups that
well-meaning consumers are buying products falsely touted as
environmentally safe.
   In the case of Hefty bags, Mobil had claimed that a chemical
additive accelerated the bag's decomposition when exposed to
sunlight in landfills. But because most bags are buriedr
image problems in the United States by making corporate charitable
donations and hiring lobbyists to represent them in Washington.
Now, in response to accusations that Tokyo has been buying support
from U.S. officials and academics, some Japanese protest what they
call a ``Japan-lobby hunt'' reminiscent of anti-Communist campaigns
during the McCarthy era.

<HEAD>Union: GM To Spend $140 Million at Linden Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will spend $140 million
to retool its Linden plant to make light trucks and recall 800
laid-off workers as part of a tentative agreement with the United
Auto Workers, a union official said Friday.
   General Motors refused to confirm the union official's report,
and the president of UAW Local 595, Charlie Marshall, said he was
not prepared to comment.
   The plant had been scheduled to cease producing cars in 1991,
but would be spared under an agreement ratified Tuesday by a vote
of rank-and-file union members, said Guy Messina, shop chairman of
UAW Local 595.
   ``We have had and have concluded negotiations, but they must be
approved by the corporation,'' Messina said. ``I think they will
approved in the next week or two.''
   Messina said one of the key negotiating points was the union's
willingness to give up a 10-minute coffee break. He said the
membership voted 1,096-541 to give up the coffee break in exchange
for the new light truck job.
   Messina said the Linden plant was competing with at least three
other assembly plants that put in bids for the production work.

<HEAD>Douglas Gets 10 Orders, 10 Options for New Jumbo Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan Air Lines ordered 10 of
McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new MD-11 jumbo jets and placed options
for 10 more in a deal potentially worth nearly $2 billion,
McDonnell Douglas announced Friday.
   The deal brings to 340 the number of orders and options placed
for MD-11s since the three-engine airplane, based on the DC-10, was
announced in December 1986.
   Other airlines who have ordered it this year include Singapore
Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, whose commitments totaled 35
MD-11s.
   The MD-11 is built by McDonnell Douglas' Douglas Aircraft unit
in Long Beach.
   McDonnell Douglas is flight-testing the first two MD-11s, and
hopes to win government approval and deliver the first ones this
fall.
   The $90 million plane competes with the European consortium
