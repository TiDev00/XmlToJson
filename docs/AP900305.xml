   A national union of the homeless said Monday
it had seized at least seven vacant, government-owned houses as
part of a national protest against housing policies.
   The National Union of the Homeless, which claims 18,000 homeless
and formerly homeless members in 16 cities, said it took five
houses in Philadelphia and one each in Alexandria, Va. and Detroit.
Police prevented a move to take a house in New York City.
   The Philadelphia-based union said it also planned takeovers in
Minneapolis, Chicago and Washington, D.C. Coordinators of those
groups either didn't have information on the activities, or
couldn't be contacted Monday night because of disconnected
telephones.
   Anna Kontradas, a senior adviser to Housing and Urban
Development secretary Jack Kemp, didn't address the union's actions
directly, but said in a statement that HUD's ``immediate goal is to
help provide both housing and supportive services to those who are
homeless today.''
   ``We feel like it's insane to have boarded-up houses when so
many people are homeless,'' said Ronald Darnaby of the Philadelphia
union, which took over five homes.
   In New York, about 30 members of the Tent City chapter of the
union were thwarted by police in their attempt to take a house,
said union member Renaldo Casanova. He said two groups members were
arrested.
   Casanova, 43, defended the group's actions.
   ``I think it is against the law to let people live in the
streets,'' he said.
   In northern Virginia and in Detroit, groups reportedly occupied
a vacant house. No further details were available.
   A member of the Tucson Union of Homeless in Arizona said his
group plans to set up a homeless camp next week in front of a
federal building located downtown.
   The union wants a number of changes in national policies,
including HUD allocation of 50,000 homes it owns to the homeless.
   ``We are sick and tired of empty promises,'' union President
Leona Smith said.
   ``The government is more committed to bailing out mismanaged
savings and loans banks than to saving and restoring the lives of
people who are homeless, chronically unemployed and who are being
pressed into a permanent underclass status,'' she said.
   The organization also wants half of all community development
block grant money earmarked for remodeling or new construction of
low-income housing and for more rent subsidies.
   The coordinator for the homeless for HUD's regional office in
Philadelphia, Pat Mulligan, said his agency considered the seizures
illegal trespassing, but said officials had not decided how to
respond.
   City officials sent in building inspectors, but no police
officers.
   Police Lt. Ed Kachigian said the city had referred the seizures
to HUD and would not act against the homeless unless HUD requested
police assistance.
   Darnaby said the coalition checked with HUD's inventory to
identify houses for sale, then discussed the proposed seizures with
community leaders and neighborhood clergy.
   The two-story houses would house two families each. None of the
houses had utilities, Darnaby said.
   Inside one of the houses on Monday morning, protesters and
homeless people wearing coats huddled around kerosene heaters and
sipped hot drinks while about 20 other members picketed the
sidewalks outside.
   ``We'll stay as long as it takes,'' said Charles Thompson.
   Across the street at Chew Transmission Center, an employee who
would only identify himself as Ed said he had considered buying the
house from HUD, and said the coalition should not be allowed to
seize the house.
   `I think they should have to pay for it,'' he said.
   City Housing Commissioner Ed Schwartz said his department would
not try to force the squatters out.
   Schwartz said he was willing to act as a mediator between
Dignity Shelter, which is part of the union, and HUD, a role he
played two years ago when the group seized several houses. HUD
later sold those houses to Dignity Shelter.
   Mulligan said the federal agency gives priority to shelter
groups when selling houses and offers the groups leases for $1 a
year.

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a thousand miles from the Mexican
border is perhaps the nation's unlikeliest drug battlefield, a
small city in a farming valley that is being compared to Miami and
New York.
   Drug dealers riding a sort of underground railroad to wealth
have turned Yakima County into the heroin and cocaine trafficking
capital of the Pacific Northwest.
   Traveling on long-established migrant farmworker routes from
deep inside Mexico, they have brought death and disrepute.
   The sound of an AK-47 assault rifle shatters the evening calm
one night. On another, a man's arm is chopped off with a machete,
apparently the fallout from a soured drug deal. U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents arrest entire families, and
police use spotlights to illuminate known drug houses.
   Once notable mostly for growing many of the nation's apples,
Yakima County has become a front line in the nation's war on drugs.
   ``There is a war between the people of this city and the drug
cartels,'' says county commissioner Graham Tollefson. ``This is not
a war we are capable of winning ourselves.''
   William Bennett, the federal drug czar, visited the city of
50,000 people last October and was astonished, said his spokesman,
David Robb.
   ``Secretary Bennett came away with the feeling that for a
community its size, there was clearly something wrong there,'' Robb
said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``It definitely
jumps off the map.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., hoping to use Bennett's reaction to
gain more DEA agents and federal resources, asked that Yakima
County be designated a ``high-intensity drug trafficking area.''
   Bennett instead selected New York City, Miami, Los Angeles,
Houston and the southwest border region. But in a letter to Adams,
his office acknowledged the Yakima area's problem and promised more
help.
   Yakima County has become a warehouse and wholesale distribution
point for drugs eventually consumed in other communities, said
Robert Dreisbach, head of the DEA's office here.
   When the DEA opened its full-time office in 1986, agents were
amazed by what they found, Dresibach said.
   ``I never saw anything like it,'' he said.
   But perhaps they should not have been surprised.
   While Yakima County is one of the world's premier food
producers, supplying the nation with asparagus, apples, mint,
pears, fruit juice and hops for beer, the metropolitan area ranked
fifth from the bottom in per capita income in 1988 in a U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics study.
   The county's 186,000 residents easily have the state's highest
metropolitan unemployment rate, 14 percent in January.
   Education levels are low and good-paying jobs are scarce, making
drug-dealing an attractive option for those seeking to avoid the
fields or the Fruit Row warehouses.
   The minority population also is high compared to the rest of the
state. Law officers say the county's 17 percent Hispanic population
provides a perfect cover for drug-dealers from Mexico to move
freely in and out of the area.
   The problem has spread to other counties in central Washington
as well.
   Franklin County, with just 35,000 residents, has the highest per
capita felony caseload in the state, and a $350,000 court budget
deficit. The county seat of Pasco was the site of a mass murder in
1988 in which five men were shot to death in an auto body shop. The
presumed motive was drugs. The presumed killers escaped to Mexico.
   The city of Wenatchee, 100 miles north, has shown signs of
sprouting as a drug trafficking center.
   Along with the drugs come violence and an overloaded criminal
justice system described as near collapse.
   Drug arrests in Yakima jumped from under 300 in 1984 to more
than 700 in 1988. The new county jail is already 30 percent over
capacity, holding more than 400 prisoners a day.
   Law officers time their arrests to days when there is available
jail space, Dreisbach said. Prosecutors are bogged down with
caseloads triple those in nearby cities.
   ``We can't even put people in jail,'' said police officer Maria
Schade, who for two years has been pursuing street-level dealers in
the city's central business district. ``It's got to be a felony or
a warrant.''
   More troubling, violent crime has become almost commonplace.
There were 23 murders in the county last year, following a record
28 the year before. As recently as 1984, only nine murders were
recorded.
   Not coincidentally, requests from county residents for gun
permits jumped from 411 in 1986 to 2,256 in 1989, Sheriff Doug
Blair said.
   Police Chief Pleas Green says nearly all the murders are
drug-related and believes it's only a matter of time before one of
his officers is killed.
   ``We have stepped up training in officer survival techniques,''
he said.
   An example of the scope of the area's drug trade was last
August's DEA raid that broke up two long-time drug-dealing families
in the Yakima Valley and produced 18 arrests in Yakima, Tacoma,
Seattle and Portland, Ore.
   For 15 years, the multi-generation drug families had provided up
to 200 kilograms of cocaine a month to the Seattle and Portland
areas, Dreisbach said.
   The operation was not that sophisticated, but provided another
example of the drug pipeline police have come to know and fear.
   ``They get into a car and drive it south,'' Dreisbach said.
``They put drugs in the car and drive it north.''

<TEXT>
   Like many residents, auto parts dealer
Jose Chavez has developed a fear of teen-agers in his crime-plagued
colonia near the South Texas border.
   His advice for visitors: ``If you stop there at nighttime and
you see a bunch of kids, you better not stop.''
   They might be Tri-City Bombers, a youth gang claiming Lopezville
as its territory. Other gangs roam many of Hidalgo County's rural
colonias, the scores of impoverished subdivisions where migrant
farm workers live along unpaved streets without adequate water,
sewers or drainage.
   In this farming region separated from the rest of the country by
huge ranches, people wonder how they ended up with a social problem
considered symptomatic of big-city angst and alienation.
   How did they get an ``asphalt jungle'' in a place where the
streets aren't even paved?
   Officials say the Lower Rio Grande Valley's gangs remain
relatively unsophisticated. Yet, just as in Los Angeles, Chicago
and other cities, they steal, fight and attack enemies' windows
with rocks and bullets.
   Sometimes, they kill. In January, a gunfight between what police
said were rival gang members left two young men dead in the town of
San Juan.
   It is the despair of poverty, some say, that leads to gang
membership, along with a high school dropout rate that hovers
around 50 percent.
   ``Kids are real bored, man,'' said Gabriel Benavides, a
17-year-old still in school who has been named by the Hildago
County Sheriff's Department as a Tri-City Bombers leader.
   The gang, which claims about 200 members, is named for the
cities of Pharr, San Juan and Alamo, which share a school district.
The spray-painted ``TCB'' initials show up everywhere in Lopezville.
   ``It's like having an outside family. We're all brothers,''
Benavides said, putting his fist on his heart with the index and
pinky fingers extended _ the TCB salute.
   They don't like to fight, he said, but cautioned: ``I have a
tendency to cause pain. If you give me trouble, I have a tendency
to cause pain. If you don't mess with me, I won't give you pain.''
   TCB member Jorge Alberto Cantu, 20, remains in jail without
bond, accused in the shooting deaths of two males who authorities
said belonged to a gang called the Spoilers. TCB members confrnted
a group of Spoilers outside a San Juan video arcade the night of
Jan. 5, said Police Chief Rene Lizcano.
   Parents of the victims, 14-year-old Guadalupe Gonzalez Jr. and
his 21-year-old cousin, Miguel Ojeda, said neither belonged to a
gang.
   ``He was going to get married a week later,'' Oralia Ojeda said
of her son.
   Chavez gave up on keeping glass in the windows at his small
store, Joe's Auto Parts. Gang members would throw rocks through
them in revenge every time he painted over the graffiti they
sprayed on his storefront, he said. Now, the windows are covered
with heavy sheets of plywood.
   One night, a brick sailed through the front window of Chavez's
house and hit his wife in the head, he said. Another day, someone
fired shots into the cab of his truck.
   ``A lot of these people, they don't say nothing because they're
afraid these kids will come and do something at their house at
night while they're asleep,'' Chavez said.
   Two years ago, five area gang members were convicted of beating
a 27-year-old man to death with a baseball bat outside a
convenience store. They left his 33-year-old brother with permanent
brain damage, said Chief Deputy Bob Davis of the sheriff's
department.
   ``Apparently, it wasn't over anything,'' Davis said. ``These
guys were on their turf.''
   Davis estimates about 25 gangs operate in the county's rural
areas, covered by only seven patrol cars. Gang members smashed the
windows out of four patrol cars in a melee last Halloween.
   Some residents say the gangs have been around for nearly a
decade but drew authorities' attention only after the cars were
attacked.
   The developments worry J. Michael Olivero, a criminal justice
professor at the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg.
   Olivero, who studied gangs in the Chicago area, believes the
South Texas groups could become sophisticated crime rings involved
in extortion, drug trafficking and other crimes typical of urban
gangs.
   ``They found a kid with an Uzi,'' Olivero said. ``The things
aren't cheap.''
   Graffiti representing California and Illinois gangs has started
appearing on area walls, which Olivero said could result from
children of migrant farm families traveling to other states.
   Community leaders have been meeting recently to address the gang
problem, and say parks and jobs would help kids stay out of trouble.
   School officials, meanwhile, have promised a late afternoon bus
route to give students in outlying areas a chance to participate in
extracurricular activities.
   Chris Willingham, head counselor at the local high school, said
the transient lives of migrant farm workers keep many children
off-balance at school. Many arrive late in the year and leave
early, she said.
   ``We're going to have to address the educational needs of these
kids,'' Olivero said, ``and we're going to have to get them water
and get them roads and things like that to facilitate a sense of
pride. Kids who are integrated with family, church and school don't
join gangs.''
   But while Lizcano, the San Juan police chief, acknowledges the
county has a problem, he rejects the theory that gangs are fostered
by poverty and hopelessness.
   ``I grew up in a colonia myself,'' he said, ``and I'm a chief of
police.''

   Windows of bungalows lining the streets of the
city's industrial Southeast Side are starting to sport new signs _
an airplane stamped with a red circle and a slash.
   The message: No airport.
   Mayor Richard M. Daley's plan to build a third metropolitan
airport near the Indiana line has sparked heated debate among
politicians in two states and across the neighborhoods that would
be bulldozed and replaced with runways.
   Daley announced the $4.9 billion project two weeks ago, saying
it represents jobs and an investment that would help revitalize the
area, site of shuttered steel mills and toxic dumps.
   But Indiana officials are fighting for a share of any new
airport that might be built to alleviate congestion at Chicago's
O'Hare International, the world's busiest. A bi-state committee
already had been considering four possible sites, none in Chicago.
   And even in Hegewisch, a mixed industrial and residential
neighborhood Daley's Lake Calumet Airport would displace, there is
no consensus.
   ``Why should we have to leave? Why should somebody tell us where
to live?'' homeowner Janet Chibicki said last week.
   But contractor James Amendola, a resident for 26 years, says
there are any number of reasons to bulldoze Hegewisch for an
airport.
   ``I think it'd be really good for the area considering we got
dumps on one side killing us. The water's contaminated. What have
we got left? All's we got left is people got pride,'' he said.
   On one street, a block of white frame houses dead-ends with a
view of a flaming smokestack at the LTV Steel yard. At the William
W. Powers State Fish and Wildlife Area, picnic tables overlook oil
tanks on the opposite shore of Wolf Lake.
   Under the mayor's proposal, 5,510 to 9,360 homes would be
replaced by runways in Chicago's Hegewisch and South Deering
neighborhoods and in suburban Burnham and Calumet City.
   ``It took everything we have to get this house, now they're
going to take it away from us,'' said Mrs. Chibicki. She and her
husband, Gary, saved 10 years before buying it for $64,000 in 1988,
and she does not think they'll get a fair price for it.
   ``I don't think anybody, even the powerful mayor of the city of
Chicago, has the right to literally destroy neighborhoods, when you
have options 20 miles south or east of us,'' said Calumet City
Mayor Robert Stefaniak.
   No option has won federal support and even if Lake Calumet
Airport is built, it would not open for about 20 years.
   The airport would cover 9,400 acres, compared with O'Hare's
7,700 acres. The city intends to pay for it with bonds, federal
grants and either a $2.25 tax on travelers at O'Hare and Midway
Airport on the Southwest Side, or state and local taxes.
   The city estimates the airport would create more than 200,000
permanent jobs and each year would inject $13.7 billion into the
regional economy.
   The city has pledged to reimburse homeowners at fair-market
value and to pay moving expenses and a relocation allowance, said
Marj Halperin, Daley's deputy press secretary.
   Daley's announcement also spawned a political fight, because it
pre-empts the Illinois-Indiana committee that already had chosen
four finalist airport sites, two in Indiana and two south of
Chicago.
   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., has enlisted the aid of fellow
Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, to fight
Daley's plan.
   ``The mayor's plan is clearly unfair to Indiana, which has
played by the rules from the beginning in the selection process for
that new airport,'' Coats said.
   He is trying to block $5.2 million the city requested from the
Federal Aviation Administration to produce a master plan for the
airport.
   Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., has accused U.S. Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner, former chairman of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northern Illinois, of favoring the city.
   ``All I've agreed to do is not eliminate any choices,'' Skinner
said last week after meeting with Coats and Dole.

   While jittery Southern Californians sweated
out earthquake aftershocks last week, officials took another step
in a pioneering effort to issue warnings when they believe stronger
jolts might be on the way.
   ``We're trying to save lives and property with whatever
knowledge the scientists can derive from their instruments,'' said
Michael Guerin, spokesman for California's Office of Emergency
Services.
   Researchers are still a long way from being able to predict the
exact time and place of earthquakes. But they are learning to use
statistics on historical quakes to estimate the odds that one jolt
might be followed soon by a larger one.
   There is about a 5 percent chance a moderate quake in California
will be followed within three days by an equal or bigger jolt,
according to research by U.S. Geological Survey seismologists Paul
Reasenberg and Lucile Jones.
   So, four hours after a moderate quake measuring 5.5 on the
Richter scale shook Southern California on Wednesday, the Office of
Emergency Services issued a formal earthquake advisory to four
counties and the news media. It said scientists believed an equally
powerful or stronger quake could happen within three days.
   The advisory _ officials avoided calling it a warning or
prediction _ expired Saturday without a bigger quake, although
dozens of smaller aftershocks rattled the region, including one
that measured 3.4 on the Richter scale Sunday.
   It was only the fifth time since 1985 the state issued such an
advisory.
   The other advisories, which also expired without a strong quake,
were issued in June 1984 after three magnitude-4 quakes in San
Diego, in July 1986 after a 6.1 quake in the eastern Sierra Nevada,
and in June 1988 and August 1989 following 5.0 and 5.2 temblors on
the San Andreas Fault south of San Francisco Bay.
   The section of the San Andreas involved in the 1988 and 1989
advisories finally ruptured on Oct. 17, 1989, in the 7.1-magnitude
earthquake that killed 67 people in the San Francisco Bay region.
   Officials have said the advisories raised the level of public
preparedness for that disaster.
   Because of differing scientific opinions and a desire to avoid
public panic, the latest advisory was even more vaguely worded than
previous ones, Guerin said. It neither cited a percentage
likelihood for a larger quake, nor said how large that quake might
be.
   ``Right now in this branch of science, vague is
state-of-the-art,'' Guerin said.
   Al Langworthy, a San Bernardino County emergency planner, said
the advisory didn't alter local precautions undertaken after the
main quake.
   But Lt. Gary Schoeller of the Los Angeles County sheriff's
Emergency Operations Bureau said quake advisories can spur
authorities and citizens to take precautions.
   Examples include ``taking fire trucks outside fire stations
(which might collapse and crush them), and alerting our people
there may be a need to call them to duty,'' Schoeller said.
   Guerin said the state hopes citizens heed advisories by avoiding
hazardous old buildings during high-risk periods, moving home
furnishings that might topple, making sure a wrench is available to
shut off gas lines, knowing the whereabouts of relatives, and
stockpiling food, water, flashlights, radios and batteries.
   But the higher the potential for disaster, the greater the
caution by officials.
   A magnitude-6.2 quake near the California-Mexico border on Nov.
23, 1987, spurred an all-night vigil by scientists and officials as
aftershocks migrated toward the San Andreas Fault. They debated
whether to issue an advisory saying the quake might be a foreshock
to the long-feared 8.3-magnitude ``big one'' the government has
said might kill 14,000 people.
   No advisory was issued and the ``big one'' didn't happen, but
the 6.2 quake was followed 12 hours later by a magnitude-6.6 jolt
on another nearby fault. Ninety-four people were injured.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Soviets in Egypt Downed 21 Israeli Planes in 1970</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet gunners disguised as Egyptian soldiers shot
down 21 Israeli fighter jets in the summer of 1970 during
Egyptian-Israeli combat near the Suez Canal, a Soviet newspaper
reports.
   The Soviets openly assisted the Egyptian army until a 1971 break
in Soviet-Egyptian relations, but neither country had formally
revealed that the Soviets engaged in direct combat with Israeli
warplanes.
   The Sovietskaya Rossiya newspaper quoted a retired Soviet
colonel, Konstantin Popov, as saying divisions of Soviet
anti-aircraft gunners were involved in the combat, bringing down
Israeli Mirage and Phantom fighters.
   It said Popov commanded one of the divisions near Suez and
recalled the fights with Israeli planes in detail in a full-page
article.
   The officially Soviet press, which has been reporting on
previously censored chapters of the Soviet military's past, carried
a similar revelation last year about the combat role of Soviet
``advisers'' in the Vietnam War.
   Popov described how Soviet soldiers in civilian dress were
smuggled on a merchant ship from the Black Sea into the
Mediterranean, past corrupt Turkish guards, and then transported to
Egypt.
   On June 30, 1970, a Soviet division brought down its first
Phantom, Popov was quoted as saying. On July 18, eight Soviet
troops were killed when they were hit by Israeli planes.
   ``In all, during the military activity of the Soviet pilots and
gunners, 21 Israeli planes were brought down,'' Sovietskaya Rossiya
said.
   Popov credited the Soviet gunners with stopping Israeli air
attacks on Egypt. They ``forced the Israelis to understand that
Soviet gunners would not allow them to act freely in the skies over
Egypt and heighten aggression,'' the article said.
   Popov was unimpressed, however, by the reward he said the
government of Egypt gave the Soviet troops on their departure: some
hastily stamped aluminum medals.

   Gen. Augusto Pinochet is taking his final
bows, declaring democracy restored after a coup and more than 16
years in power, but the civilians who will follow him say the job
has just begun.
   Pinochet says he is leaving a thriving, orderly nation to
President-elect Patricio Aylwin, who takes office March 11.
   ``We promised to restore democracy and we have done it,''
Pinochet said recently on a farewell tour of this narrow,
3,000-mile-long nation on South America's west coast. ``We gave it
the indispensable stability required for living in peace, freedom
and solidarity.''
   His critics don't see it that way.
   ``The transition to democracy will be very, very hard, but the
alternative to tackling the difficulties is remaining under a
dictatorship,'' said Jorge Arrate, head of the Socialist Party.
   His party is prominent in Aylwin's center-left coalition. Arrate
and others in the alliance say they are inheriting a powder keg of
social problems long ignored or suppressed by Pinochet's military
government.
   They say the new administration will be hard-pressed by the need
for more social services, wage demands from labor and the desire
for justice in cases of human rights abuses.
   Pinochet, 74, insists on retaining command of the 60,000-man
army for up to eight more years, as permitted by the 1980
constitution his government wrote.
   He also hints at an eventual return to power and has not ruled
out running in the 1994 election. At public gatherings in the
waning days of his presidency, supporters can be heard shouting
``You'll be back soon!'' or ``Until 1994!''
   The general held a referendum in 1988, trying to get approval
for an eight-year extension of his presidency, but the voters said
no. That forced him to call an election, and Aylwin, a 71-year-old
centrist Christian Democrat, got 55 percent of the vote.
   Small but enthusiastic crowds have turned out for Pinochet's
farewell tour, which uses the slogan ``Mission accomplished.''
   Pinochet proudly tells them that Chile enjoys one of Latin
America's healthiest economies, one of its lowest inflation rates _
about 20 percent a year _ and a gross national product that has
grown steadily for six years.
   He says the political and social disorder that was rampant when
he overthrew the elected government of President Salvador Allende,
an avowed Marxist, in September 1973 has been replaced by an
orderly society.
   The 1980 constitution provides an institutional bulwark against
chaos or a Communist threat, according to Pinochet.
   Critics, however, consider the claims unfounded and the tour a
disgrace.
   ``This idea that we have to express our gratitude, it's
absurd,'' Arrate said. ``He's the only Chilean president ever to
stage a farewell carnival.''
   Arrate said Pinochet's claim to have laid the institutional
groundwork for democracy was contradicted by last-minute laws that
cut Aylwin's authority and gave armed forces unprecedented
autonomy, among other changes.
   The new government plans to modify many of the laws, but ``the
problem is you lose time in undoing those things,'' said Ricardo
Ffrench-Davis, an economist with Aylwin's Christian Democratic
Party.
   He said Pinochet's pride in the economic growth of the last six
years ``is arbitrary, like so many arbitrary things that have
occurred under this government.''
   Pinochet also must take responsibility for ``the worst recession
in Latin America'' in the early 1980s, when production in Chile
fell by more than 13 percent and unemployment soared to 20 percent
or more, Ffrench-Davis said.
   Improvement since then has represented recovery, with very
little growth, the economist said, and poor people have not had a
proper share in it.
   ``If you take the top 20 percent of the population and the
bottom 20 percent, the gap has been growing all these years,'' he
said.
   Ffrench-Davis said there is a desperate need for better public
education and health services, but he and other economists in
Aylwin's camp praise the existing free-market, export-oriented
economic program and do not plan major changes.
   To distribute Chile's wealth, ``the economy must grow, and for
the economy to grow, you must have stability,'' he said.
   Most unions were suppressed under Pinochet and Aylwin also
expects a chorus of demands for higher wages, but Arrate said
workers and the poor must not expect too much.
   ``We can't correct from one day to the next all the inequities
that have accumulated during 16 years,'' he said. ``All we can do
is give signs that the government has changed its tendency.''
   Democracy is expected to bring a cry for justice in hundreds of
pending cases of alleged human rights violations by security
forces. At least 700 people disappeared after the coup and
thousands were jailed and tortured.
   Demands by rights groups for swift and severe punishment
probably will not be met. Aylwin has stressed the need for national
reconciliation and said justice must be tempered by a spirit of
pardon.

<HEAD>University President Believed Among Americans Dead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former president of Brandeis Univesity and
his wife are suspected to be among the Americans killed in last
week's fire at a luxury hotel, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said
Sunday.
   The spokeswoman said the bodies of Marver Bernstein and his wife
were believed to be in the Cairo morgue but she could not confirm
the deaths until a medical report was received. So far, she said,
they are listed as unaccounted for.
   Dr. Kamal el-Saadani of Cairo's central morgue said Friday that
a man with a similar name was among the dead and that the body of
an unidentified woman was thought to be that of his wife.
   If confirmed, the deaths would bring to four the number of
Americans killed in the hotel fire Thursday at the Heliopolis
Sheraton, in which 17 people died.
   According to The Washington Post, Bernstein, 71, was dean of the
Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at
Princeton University before serving as president of Brandeis in
Waltham, Mass., from 1972 to 1983. He then joined the faculty of
the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, where he taught both
politics and philosophy and coordinated the school's American
courses program.
   After his retirement from Georgetown last year, he remained as a
lecturer. Bernstein, born in Mankato, Minn., and Sheva Rosenthal, a
native of St. Paul, Minn., married in 1943, the paper said.
   Also Sunday, police said all Cairo hotels will be checked for
adequate firefighting equipment.
   Maj. Gen. Fahr el-Din Khaled, head of the tourist police, said a
police committee would check all hotels whether or not they have
canvas tents similar to the one at the Sheraton where the fire
started.
   ``This committee will prepare a comprehensive report which will
be presented to the tourism minister to take suitable procedures so
that such accidents do not happen in Egypt again,'' Khaled said,
according to the official Middle East News Agency.
   Sheraton officials have insisted that a fire alarm was sounded
when the fire spread from its garden tent restaurant to the hotel
building itself early Thursday.
   They said hotel workers tried to put out the blaze with
extinguishers, but strong winds caused it to spread so quickly it
became uncontrollable.
   Survivors said there was no fire alarm or sprinkler system.
   Egyptian officials have said the canvas tents popular at most
luxury hotels in Egypt are illegal because they are fire hazards.
   But spokesmen for four major hotels in Cairo contacted by The
Associated Press said their tents had adequate safety precautions
and there was no plan to dismantle them.
   It was not immediately clear if officials would ban the tents,
which usually house restaurants or nightclubs.
   Tourism is one of Egypt's main sources of foreign currency. In
1989, 2.4 million tourists visited Egypt, bringing $2.3 billion
into the country, according to official figures.

   The huge blue-and-white banner behind the
president of the National Education Association declared: ``No More
Reports, No More Speeches. We Want Action.''
   That backdrop signaled the group's intention to press for
innovations it says are needed in the nation's schools.
   ``Over the past five years, we at NEA have launched program
after program at the cutting edge of the movement to restructure
America's schools,'' said Keith Geiger, NEA president. ``We have
helped launch educational improvement projects at the school,
district and state level in almost every one of our states _ more
than 600 projects and programs.''
   Geiger's speech, delivered at the National Press Club, was
hardly unusual for a labor leader trying to boost the standing of
his membership. But it also illustrated the eagerness with which
the NEA _ along with hundreds of other education leaders and
politicians _ has endorsed the notion of ``restructuring'' the
nation's schools.
   The idea has gained attention and momentum as President Bush and
the nation's governors set and promote education goals.
   Geiger's speech was timed to coincide with the winter meeting of
the National Governors Association this past week. The session
focused on completing six national goals and agreeing on the
restructuring needed to achieve them.
   ``These goals are ambitious, yet they can and must be
achieved,'' said the NGA document. ``However, they cannot be
achieved by our education system as it is presently constituted.
Substantial, even radical changes will have to be made.''
   The NGA defined restructuring as changing what is taught and how
it is taught, to get away from an emphasis on low-level basics and
instead make sure that students are involved in challenging
learning activities.
   The American Association of School Administrators said
restructuring might include changes in the curriculum; variations
in federal-state-local relationships; reform in the way teachers
are prepared and paid; dealing more effectively with at-risk
students, or simply fostering changes in the way people think.
   Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington told reporters at the NGA
meeting, ``All governors made a commitment to lead restructuring
efforts in their states.''
   For example, Maine Gov. John McKernan Jr. pointed to a rural
middle school which has been divided into teams of teachers and
students who spend two years together. The teams have their own
budgets and the flexibility to set their own schedules and goals
within broad school guidelines.
   Officials said discipline problems are down and student
involvement in learning is up.
   ``It takes educators a while to learn that they can go beyond
existing boundaries,'' said McKernan. ``The cumulative effect of
many regulations built up over the years has been to create an
ingrained way of thinking and operating.''
   Gov. Steve Cowper of Alaska told how students from Eskimo
villages are invited to study at an open-enrollment high school in
Sitka. The curriculum focuses on Pacific basin trade opportunities
and includes instruction in Chinese, Japanese and Russian.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said 328 companies in his
state have been encouraged to open classrooms at plant sites. He
said workers can take remedial education courses or upgrade their
skills. The program uses federal-state job training funds, he said.
   Other examples given were of Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin's
focus on services to at-risk 3- and 4-year-olds to ensure they
enter school prepared for learning, and Connecticut Gov. William
O'Neill's investment of state aid to cities and towns and a boost
of teachers' salaries to the second highest in the nation.
   Students at the Lassiter Middle School in Louisville, Ky., who
turn in unsatisfactory work do not get a failing grade. Instead,
the teachers work with them until the students' work is up to
standard.
   ``The goals of these projects are almost identical to the
national goals,'' said Geiger.
   To share information on the projects, the NEA created a network
called the National Center for Innovation in Education. Geiger said
the center has the capacity to involve all of NEA's 2 million
members, ``working in schools in every community in America.''
   Two years ago, the American Federation of Teachers began a
Center for Restructuring to serve as a clearinghouse and to develop
a network among school districts and local unions.
   One of the AFT projects is a joint venture with Apple Computer
to create a multimedia resource that teachers can use to learn
about projects in other areas.
   ``Restructured schools need not start from scratch, and they
need not operate by trial and error,'' said an AFT brochure.

<TEXT>
   From a small, ground floor office in a
Republican stronghold, one of the leaders of the post-Watergate
Democratic surge is plotting his congressional comeback after eight
years in political exile.
   Toby Moffett came to Washington in 1974 as one of the
``Watergate babies,'' reform-minded Democrats bent on cleaning up
the tarnished image of American politics.
   Twice a loser in bids for statewide office in Connecticut,
Moffett has decided the House is what he enjoys after all.
   ``I think it's an important time to go back to Washington,'' he
said.
   Moffett gave up his House seat in 1982 to wage an unsuccessful
challenge to then-GOP Sen. Lowell Weicker. After another
disappointing showing in 1986 when he failed to get on the
Democratic primary ballot for governor, Moffett spent three
unsatisfying years as a television anchor.
   ``I was really looking to do something more challenging,''
Moffett said. ``It's really a process of trying to understand what
you do best and what you enjoy doing best.''
   The 45-year-old father of five recently moved to Newton in
Connecticut's fifth district to run for a seat being vacated by
U.S. Rep. John Rowland, a Republican candidate for governor.
   ``Let's be honest,'' Moffett said. ``Congressional seats don't
open up very often and this seat opened up in an area that I feel
very comfortable with.''
   And as he plots his comeback, Moffett is tailoring his
statements and positions to an audience of rock-ribbed Republicans
and blue-collar Democrats.
   In January, he proposed allowing the president to order the
assassination of foreign leaders who commit criminal acts and
threaten U.S. interests. He says he could accept a ``fair'' version
of a capital gains tax cut and even says there may be enough room
in the federal budget to pass a tax break for the middle class.
   His comments on federal programs do nothing to support the label
of big-spending liberal that one GOP opponent has tried to attach
to Moffett.
   ``We're not going to have for the foreseeable future a lot of
money to play with to do great new things,'' Moffett said. ``We
have to focus.''
   Moffett brings to the race the 90 percent name recognition of
his four terms in Congress and three years as a television anchor
in Hartford. In Washington, he has the backing of some of his
former colleagues, including House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
and other leaders who have promised him first crack at prestigious
committee assignments.
   But Moffett would be the first to admit that his political
comeback is anything but a foregone conclusion.
   He faces a Democratic opponent, Shelton Mayor Michael Pacowta,
who commands strong support in the party apparatus. Five
Republicans are vying for the nomination including one candidate,
James McLaughlin, who recently referred to Moffett as a
``free-wheeling, nutty, cocky big-spending liberal of the 1970s.''
   And Moffett will be running with the ``carpetbagger'' label in
the state's most conservative district at a time when Rowland,
highly popular locally, may be the top Republican on the statewide
ballot. And although Moffett was successful as a congressional
candidate, he is 0 for 2 in his most recent political battles.
   ``Clearly three strikes and you're out in this business. It's a
lot like baseball. And he's got two strikes,'' said Dick Foley,
head of the Connecticut Republican Party. ``He's out of step with
Connecticut and out of step with America and that means you're way
out of step with the fifth district.''
   Moffett came to Congress at age 29 with a background of
grassroots, citizen advocacy and motto of ``making old laws work.''
   In 1979, he became the youngest subcommittee chairman in House
history by taking over an energy and environment panel. Moffett
investigated top Reagan administration officials James Watt, the
Interior secretary, and Anne Gorsuch Burford, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency; worked on acid rain legislation
and new formulas for Medicaid reimbursements, and improved
evacuation plans for nuclear plants.
   Political scientist William Schneider, who has written
extensively on the class of '74, disagrees with those who say
Moffett won't survive in his new, more conservative district.
   ``The class of '74 Democrats were unique in that they learned
how to survive in Republican districts,'' Schneider said. The group
included onetime presidential candidates Gary Hart, Michael Dukakis
and Jerry Brown, all politicians who, in various offices, were able
to set themselves apart from traditional, big-spending Democrats,
Schneider said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Voter Apathy on Congressional Pay Raises</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House of Representatives' legislative
agenda is so light you could hear a bill drop. But you don't hear
second thoughts about the record pay raise the lawmakers gave
themselves last fall.
   The plan to boost House salaries by one-third by 1991 was so
sensitive that only extraordinary cooperation by House Republicans
and Democrats and President Bush made passage possible. The two
parties even agreed to punish their own candidates if they raise
the issue in this year's House elections.
   Now, eight months before election day, the deal is holding.
House salaries have quietly risen from $89,500 to $96,600. The
foremost question in the Capitol is whether the Senate, which took
a similar ``cost of living'' raise this year, will join the House's
decision to take a hefty 25 percent pay installment next January.
   If senators look toward the House to judge the political winds,
they'll find comforting, balmy breezes.
   Both Democratic and Republican leadership offices say
constituent mail on the issue has slowed to a trickle.
   So far, no one has introduced legislation to repeal the House
raise.
   Last fall, 174 members of the 435-member House voted against it.
But even in that group, the pay plan may be settling in comfortably.
   Roll Call, Capitol Hill's local newspaper, found 65 of those who
voted against the pay raise now say they'll keep the dough. Only 15
said they would give it all back to the Treasury. The bulk of the
others either were undecided or didn't respond.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, voted against the pay raise. But
having lost that battle, he has no doubt he should keep the money.
   ``He's obviously doing a better job than 99 percent of the guys
up here,'' says his spokesman, Ed Gillespie. ``He votes against a
lot of federal programs as well, but once they are funded he wants
to make sure his constituents get a fair share. It doesn't make
sense to do a better job than your colleagues and get paid less,
and his constituents would agree.''
   Some who voted against the raise decline to return the money to
the Treasury but instead promise to turn the money over to charity.
They can score political points both for turning down the raise and
as philanthropists.
   For example, Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind., is turning down this year's
pay raise as he did the previous boost. He's putting the money into
a scholarship fund he set up in his congressional district to
provide stipends to deserving students.
   The pay raise was such a big issue with the public in early 1989
that it helped topple former House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Is
it possible that voters have slipped into apathy?
   Marshall Taylor of the National Taxpayers' Union says the public
memory isn't as short as the politicians might like and his group
doesn't consider nex January's pay hike ``a fait accompli.''
   ``It's kind of seething below the surface with voters,'' he
said. ``This ticks a lot of people off,'' he said, and should be a
campaign issue even if the two parties try to avoid it.
   People who vote against the pay and then keep the money are
another issue. It's ``kind of hypocritical,'' Taylor said. ``What
are you telling the voters ... `I went on record, but, hey, I'll
take more?'''
   While slumbering now, the pay issue is almost certain to heat up
as the year goes on.
   The Senate, unless it takes action, faces the uncomfortable
prospect of being paid less than the House. And several senators
including Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.,
are pushing to ban senators from paid speechmaking, as the House
will do next year. Such a ban on outside earnings would further
increase pressure for a salary hike.
   The Senate is so politically fearful but so loath to fall behind
the House that there's already talk of a pay raise bill in a
lame-duck session after the November election.
   The permutations which arise with the pay raise issue can be
baffling.
   In Roll Call's House survey, several respondents said they would
keep the 25 percent pay raise in 1991 only if they were re-elected.
So if they lose, they'll give it back?

   President Bush, whose speeches are not
renowned for their memorable prose, is trying out warmup material
in the Johnny Carson style of news-oriented opening monologues.
   On his just-finished trip to California, the president unveiled
some topical one-liners that registered stronger on the laugh meter
than the ripple of twittering one expects at such political
functions.
   Bush got things off to a rolling start at a New York fundraiser
for congressional candidate Susan Molinari when he mentioned the
headline-grabber of the day.
   ``Here I am in the middle of the battle right here in New York,
where one of the great contests of 1990 will take place. A lot at
stake _ there's been a lot of money spent on both sides, a lot of
press attention.'' Bush paused. ``But I'm not here to talk about
the Trumps.''
   The next day, prolonged chuckling swept a ballroom breakfast of
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles when
Bush said:
   ``Being president does have its advantages ... I have a TV set
there in the White House with five screens, one big one in the
middle, four small ones around it, all of them on at once. Now I
don't have to miss the nightly news while I watch `Wheel of
Fortune.'''
   He told the TV industry audience he had six education goals for
the country to achieve by the year 2000.
   ``And this morning I want to add a seventh goal _ by the year
2000, all Americans must be able to set the clocks on their VCRs.''
   Bush couldn't resist a couple of jabs at his old nemesis, Daniel
Ortega, the leftist president of Nicaragua who was voted out of
office Feb. 25 in an upset by the U.S.-backed candidate, Violeta
Chamorro.
   He said Molinari's father, Rep. Guy Molinari, was one of his
oldest allies, even when no one gave Bush much of a chance to win
the presidency. Back then, ``the pollsters had it figured out about
the way they figured out Nicaragua,'' he said.
   At a San Francisco fundraiser for Sen. Pete Wilson, Bush
predicted Wilson would be California's next governor. But, he
warned, ``Just don't use the same pollster Ortega did.''
   Other snippets from the presidential joke file during his
California trip:
   ``Something that really impresses me about California is the
West Coast's will to survive even triumph in adversity. New ways to
cope spring up, no matter what kind of disaster strikes. Somebody
told me there's even a new support group in Malibu _ called Parents
Without Perrier.''
   Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Los Angeles Rams football team,
``has built one of the toughest teams in pro football. Who says
there's no role for women in combat?''

<HEAD>Librarians Say the Government Hinders Access to its Own Words</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Librarians are asking Congress to guarantee
public access to information generated by the nation's largest
compiler of facts _ the government itself.
   The American Library Association says the Bush administration so
far hasn't lived up to a promise to reverse Reagan administration
policies which curtailed how much information the government
gathers and restricted its distribution.
   Specifically, the 50,000-member association is concerned that
making information available through electronic means, and not on
paper, could wind up limiting access or costing the user for what
he now gets free.
   And the librarians worry about the practice of letting private
enterprise assume the responsibility of disseminating government
information in hopes of turning a profit.
   ``A system of information `haves' and `have-nots' could be
created: big business customers who can afford to buy, while
students, individuals, libraries and others cannot,'' ALA President
Patricia Wilson Berger testified last month before the Senate
Government Affairs Committee.
   The committee is considering legislation re-examining the
government's information distribution policies.
   The association fears that the proposed bill could require
libraries to pay for information they now get free from the
government. It would permit agencies to require libraries to share
distribution costs of electronically relayed information.
   ``The taxpayer already has paid to gather and generate and
maintain this information, and shouldn't be asked to pay again to
get access to it,'' said Eileen Cooke, the ALA's Washington
representative.
   Ms. Berger said she welcomes new technologies which could
enhance access to information, but added, ``they are equally
capable of erecting artificial barriers to citizens' rights to
know.''
   She said the problem arises when libraries lack equipment,
software, indexes, finding aids, trained staff and expertise in the
use of data bases.
   ``Since the earliest days of the republic,'' Ms. Berger
testified, ``the federal government has provided ways to inform the
public of its activities and to collect information essential to
its operations. Today it is the largest collector and publisher of
information in the United States.''
   But Reagan administration guidelines adopted in 1985 encouraged
the distribution of government information through private
enterprise. The guidelines also pared the government's publication
lists.
   ``Thousands of publications were scrapped, data collection
programs were scaled back, libraries of many federal agencies were
turned over to private management companies and access to the
documents of regulatory agencies was made far more difficult,'' the
ALA said.
   ``Under the Bush administration, the OMB has promised to revise
these information policies,'' the association said. ``So far,
however, no concrete action has resulted.''
   A law passed in 1858 requires the government to make its
publications available to 1,346 ``depository libraries'' around the
country. In addition, 51 regional depositories are required to get
and keep every publication issued by the Government Printing
Office. Last year, the GPO distributed 27 million copies of 68,000
different publications to the depository libraries.
   As an example of the problem, the ALA cites an electronic data
base operated by the Agriculture Department to furnish commodity,
statistical, economic and other agricultural reports.
   Until 1985, the department released the information through a
University of Nebraska computer system. Then, under new OMB
guidelines, the government signed an exclusive contract giving the
information to Martin Marietta Data Systems, which sells access to
it.
   According to the ALA, information once distributed free or at
nominal costs through the University of Nebraska to depository
libraries now costs $45 an hour from Martin Marietta or as much as
$96 an hour from clients which get the information from Martin
Marietta and redistribute it.

   A passing generation still talks
about the golden times in Prague when headwaiters shaved twice a
day, coffee houses resounded with freewheeling debate and the
pastries were more delectable than those in Vienna.
   If you want glimpses of what once was along with the proletarian
overlay of recent decades _ and an absence of the West's trendiness
_ come some evening to the Cafe Europa.
   A trio of elderly men plays Hapsburg Empire melodies while a
pair of prostitutes eye new arrivals, homosexuals in leather
jackets embrace and a scruffy man hops through the room on one leg,
clutching his crutches.
   Paintings of semi-nude goddesses, florid mirrors and cut crystal
chandeliers _ hallmarks of the art nouveau style _ adorn the
premises.
   This popular haunt, located in the Grand Hotel Europa, dates
back to the turn-of-the-century, when the Czechs were part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and the coffee houses of Vienna, Prague and
Budapest centers of social and political life.
   Their heyday continued for 30 years of independence, known
nostalgically as the ``Golden Republic'', which many Czechs today
hope will serve as a model for the future.
   ``Prague's coffee houses! Their pale remnants can no longer
evoke the cafe life between the two World Wars,'' wrote Czech poet
Jaroslav Seifert of this era. ``In the coffee houses we discussed,
planned and engaged in passionate polemics, and I never had the
feeling of time being wasted.''
   There were cafes, wrote the 1984 Nobel Prize winner, frequented
by artists; others by high society ``where the headwaiters had
themselves shaved twice a day,'' and places which attracted
students because they carried current newspapers from all over
Europe.
   These vanished with the advent of Communism rule in 1948. But
students and dissidents, like the country's new president Vaclav
Havel and author Ludvik Vaculik, continued to gather although talk
was more circumspect _ and hushed.
   In ``A Cup of Coffee with my Interrogator,'' Vaculik wrote that
it was suspected some tables in every cafe were bugged by the
authorities.
   ``Do you really think that without coffee houses there would
have been no culture? '' Vaculik asks a friend in the book.
   ``No, of course culture wasn't created there but it was an
environment that encouraged it,'' the friend replies.
   These days cafe talk is once again openly freewheeling and while
the snooping devices may have been dismantled, the places
themselves have yet to slough off the outer shabbiness and a
roughness of manner to which Communist societies everywhere seem
prone.
   The Cafe Slavia, one of the last of the great old coffee houses,
still attracts artists from the nearby opera and theater, but
filthy rags and cigarette butts lie unswept by slouching waiters.
   The future of Prague's coffee houses, like many institutions in
the dramatically changing society, seems to hang in the balance.
   Will the country's leaders and leading actresses once again be
mercilessly dissected over coffee and cake? Will the onetime sense
of stylishness return with an improving economy? Will the coffee
houses succumb to upmarket chic, catering more to tourists than
local characters?
   Meanwhile at the Cafe Europa, matrons sip coffee topped with
whipped cream for 10 crowns (25 cents) and earnest young men down
good Czech white wine for 18 crowns a glass. The three gray-haired,
bespectacled men could stand a neater fit to their suits and better
tuning of their instruments.
   During a break, a West German businessman buys the trio beers
and in a booming voice offers a lecture about all the changes they
are to expect when capitalistic ways take hold.
   They nod politely, go back to violin, viola and piano and after
their Strauss and Lehar staples, venture into Broadway tunes and
``As Time Goes By.''

   Nicaraguan rebels said Sunday they
have taken steps toward demobilization and that President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro should replace the Sandinista army with
a civilian police force.
   The U.S.-supported Contra rebels said in a statement that they
are in contact with leaders of the United National Opposition
coalition, which upset the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua's Feb.
25 elections.
   ``The resistance is conscious that there will be an authentic
democratization process in Nicaragua,'' the statement said. ``For
that reason, it is willing to change its role of insurgent army to
one of civic and political positions.''
   ``We have begun to take the necessary steps to demobilize our
combatants in search for mechanisms and guarantees appropriate to
the current situation in Nicaragua,'' it said.
   In Managua, Sandinista President Daniel Ortega said he would
need more information about which elements in the Contras made the
statement but believed ``it would be good news for all the people
of Nicaragua.''
   ``We need to wait for more information because the communique
from Honduras has no signature,'' Ortega told The Associated Press
as he was leaving church Sunday night.
   A commission sent by the incoming government of Nicaragua was to
meet with rebel leaders in Tegucigalpa this week to discuss their
return home.
   The archbishop of Managua, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, said
Sunday he would send two representatives to Honduras to sound out
the plans of the Contra rebels.
   ``I'm sending them to make a sounding before I say a word. I
want to know what the situation is,'' the cardinal told reporters
after saying Mass in his Las Sierritas parish. He said his
representatives would go Tuesday or Wednesday.
   ``I believe that once there is democratization, the armed
resistance has no reason for being,'' he said.
   The rebels said they also had begun to renew contact with the
International Support and Verification Commission on guarantees for
the safety of those returning to Nicaragua. The commission was
created under an Aug. 7, 1989, agreement among five Central
American presidents to disband the Contras.
   The statement, which offered strong support for Mrs. Chamorro,
also said her government should replace the Sandinista army with a
civilian police force.
   It did not say when that should happen.
   The statement from the Nicaraguan Resistance, titled ``Position
of the Resistance on the Triumph of Democracy in Nicaragua,'' said
the speed of demobilization of the Contras and their families would
depend on the guarantees and logistics.
   About 10,000 rebels and their families have been in camps on the
Honduran side of the border since the United States halted military
aid in February 1988. The Honduran government has said another
30,000 Nicaraguans sought shelter the past 10 years in border
provinces.
   The rebels said they have ordered ``an absolute halt in
hostilities'' and asked the coalition and the verification
commission ``to apply a special policy of persuasion'' to the 4,000
rebels estimated to have gone into Nicaragua since September.
   The rebel statement followed three days of talks between rebel
military leaders and Harry Shlaudeman, President Bush's special
envoy.

   Gretchen Polhemus, Miss USA 1989, has some
advice for her newly crowned successor: Get a lawyer.
   Polhemus said in an interview published Sunday she was required
to work 12-hour days during her reign, hadn't received all her
prizes and was denied permission to visit her sick grandmother.
   Miss Polhemus told The Wichita Eagle she considered quitting at
one point.
   The new Miss USA, Carole Gist, 20, of Detroit, was crowned
Friday at the pageant finals in Wichita.
   ``I told her to get an attorney. There's a lot of things in that
contract that are unclear,'' Miss Polhemus said.
   Pageant spokeswoman Sara Meza said pageant officials
renegotiated Miss Polhemus' contract to give her more days off
after she complained.
   Ms. Meza said the $1,300 in wardrobe expense money, $3,000 worth
of airline tickets and some camera equipment will be delivered in
two weeks. She said Miss Polhemus would have gotten the prizes even
without the new agreement.
   Miss Polhemus also said she wasn't allowed to visit her sick
grandmother in Arlington, Texas, as preparations were under way for
this year's pageant. The grandmother has suffered three strokes,
she said.
   ``I just wanted to tell her I love her,'' Miss Polhemus said.
   Miss Meza said she didn't realize the grandmother was that sick.

   Folk singer Tracy Chapman shuns the fame she
quickly found after her 1988 debut album soared to the top of the
charts and won her three Grammy awards, including best new artist.
   ``I guess if there were some way to choose what I wanted or
didn't want from what my success has brought me, I would choose not
to have the celebrity,'' Chapman said in an interview in the March
12 issue of Time.
   ``I don't think I'm very good at it.''
   Chapman's first album, ``Tracy Chapman,'' hit No. 1 on the
Billboard pop charts and sold 10 million copies. Her second album,
``Crossroads,'' has sold 4 million copies since its release five
months ago. The albums mix songs protesting poverty and racism with
love songs.
   Chapman, who begins an American tour in May, said she is hurt by
criticism of her music by other blacks.
   ``There are people who have gone so far as to say that I'm not
black or not part of the black musical tradition,'' she said. ``I
think the reason I don't get played on black radio stations is
because I don't fit into their present format. And they're not
willing to make a space for me.
   ``I'm upset by what has been said because it doesn't speak well
of black people,'' Chapman said. ``You know, it basically says
black people don't respond in a cerebral manner to music, and
that's just not true.''

   Sammy Davis Jr., fighting cancer and unable
to travel to St. Louis for the annual charity telethon that bears
his name, called from a hospital to rally fund-raisers.
   Davis, who has been hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
battling a recurrence of throat cancer, promised on Sunday to be
back in St. Louis in 1991 to again host the Sammy Davis Jr. Variety
Club Telethon.
   ``You're always there for me and next year I will be in St.
Louis with you. Let's do it for the kids,'' Davis said.
   The telethon, in its seventh year, raises money for more than
150 children's organizations in the St. Louis area. Last year it
raised $2.6 million, said Davis' spokeswoman, Susan Reynolds.
   ``The organizers of the telethon said that after the phone call
their operators were just flooded with calls,'' the spokeswoman
added. The show, featuring such celebrities as Angie Dickinson,
John Forsythe, Lou Rawls and Perry Como, was on the air in the St.
Louis area throughout the day.
   Davis hopes to leave Cedars-Sinai Medical Center soon, although
no release date has been set.
   ``The doctors are encouraged by the progress they are seeing and
he continues to get stronger every day,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ``He's
been going down the corridors, talking to patients.''

<HEAD>Quayle Calls US China Policy a `Disappointment'</HEAD>

   The Bush administration's China policy is a
disappointment because it has failed to nudge Beijing's leaders
toward political reform, Vice President Dan Quayle says.
   Quayle, appearing Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' said
he supported ``dialogue and engagement'' between the United States
and China, but he conceded the administration's policy has failed
to bring about the desired results.
   Asked if the policy had been a failure, Quayle responded: ``I
will not say it's been a failure. It's been a disappointment. It's
been a disappointment that China continues to be a holdout of
political reform.
   ``China and the leadership in China refuses to recognize
reality, and that's freedom and democracy eventually.''
   President Bush came under heavy fire from Congress after
revelations that Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser,
and Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, traveled
to Beijing for meetings shortly after the Chinese cracked down on
pro-democracy student activists at Tiananmen Square in early June.
   Some members of Congress have complained that Bush moved too
quickly to establish smooth relations with China, which has done
little to loosen restrictions on dissent since the summer.
   Bush vetoed legislation that would have barred the United States
from sending Chinese students back to their country when their
visas expire, and the Senate upheld the veto after assurances that
an executive order would accomplish the same result.
   Quayle defended the U.S. policy, saying the administration was
not going to ``stick our head in the sand and ... say that China
isn't important.''
   At the same time, he said some U.S. sanctions on China remain in
place.
   On other issues, Quayle refused to make a firm commitment on
what kind of financial package the United States might be willing
to offer Nicaragua's newly elected government.
   ``We will meet the demands of whatever is necessary,'' he said.
A group of Nicaraguans representing President-elect Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro is expected to be in Washington and New York this week
asking for $300 million in aid.
   Quayle also praised Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's ousted Sandinista
leader, as being ``very conciliatory'' after Ortega promised
earlier on the same program to turn over Nicaragua's government on
April 25 and to respect its constitution.
   ``I thought it was on target, and perhaps it appears that we do
have a new Daniel Ortega that is truly committed to democracy,''
said Quayle.
   Chamorro defeated Ortega on Feb. 25.
   Both Chamorro and Ortega have called for the demobilization of
the Contra rebels, many of whom remain at camps in Honduras. The
Contras have said they would remain intact until after Chamorro's
inauguration in April.
   Quayle said the key to demobilizing the 12,000 Contras is a
peaceful transition. While some Contras already have laid down
their weapons and returned to Nicaragua, they have done so on a
voluntary basis, he said.
   ``When democracy is there, and it appears that it's going to be,
and when the Contras feel secure, they will demobilize,'' he said.
``That's part of the peace plan.''

   Town meetings usually come and go
without much of a stir in this quiet coastal community. But a plan
to abolish local taxes promises to breathe new life into Yankee
democracy this year.
   ``A lot of people are going who wouldn't normally be there,''
said Mark Gross, one of 1,200 residents in the blueberry-canning
community.
   The proposal to scrap property taxes in 1991 and replace them
with voluntary contributions and user fees ``has got a lot of
people around town a little nervous,'' said Gross, who calls the
plan ``a lot of crazy ideas.''
   But to Royce Perkins, who is leading the tax-freedom charge from
his hand-built log home deep in the woods, scuttling taxes seems as
natural as lighting a fire in a wood-burning stove or skinning a
weasel.
   Perkins, 53, a father of five whose 150 acres roll over scenic
woodlands along a jagged coastal peninsula, envisions a system in
which non-compulsory payments and pay-as-you-go fees finance only
those services that people really want and really need.
   ``One of the great joys of life is to own your own home outright
and clear. But when you have taxes against your home, it's like a
constant mortgage,'' he said. Property taxation is like ``holding a
sword over the land.''
   A wildlife biologist and salmon fisherman in Alaska for about 20
years, Perkins returned with his family to his native environs
several years ago. Also a former teacher, he educates his children
at home. He runs the local landfill and also operates an
earth-moving business.
   His proposal is on the agenda for Tuesday's town meeting because
35 people _ five more than the minimum needed _ signed a petition.
   The man who oversees Penobscot's $1.2 million budget,
selectmen's board Chairman Jim Henry, said he's never heard of such
an extreme plan. He said he'll definitely be among those taking a
stand against it Tuesday.
   ``It's too idealistic,'' said Henry.
   Still, even Henry allows that ``I love the notion'' of having no
taxes, and he believes the debate among taxpayers is unquestionably
healthy.
   ``Now people know what services the town provides, what they
would lose and what they would have to pay for, whereas before,
they paid their taxes and didn't ask questions,'' said Henry.
   Of the total budget, $1 million goes to the schools, and the
rest is divided among services that include road maintenance, a
volunteer fire department, landfill, general government expenses
and street lights.
   Perkins sees the string of street lights in the center of
Penobscot _ a New England tableau of handsome clapboard homes,
church, school and town hall overlooking the bay and river by the
same name _ as an example of a municipal service that only the
``handful'' of its users should pay for.
   As for the big-ticket question of education, Perkins says the
state should ultimately pick up the entire tab and issue vouchers
so that families can send their children to the schools of their
choice.
   His neighbors remain skeptical.
   ``A lot of people, if they don't have to pay, they're not going
to pay,'' said Gross.
   ``Are you going to put tolls on our town roads and a toll booth
at the town dump?'' asked Kenneth Reynolds, a fish dealer.
   One of the biggest fears is the prospect of being hit with huge
school bills if parents of students are forced to support the
schools alone.
   ``In my occupation I couldn't pay to educate my children _ and
many others couldn't,'' said Rev. James Robertson of the South
Penobscot Baptist Church.
   Perkins said he has received letters of support from people in
other states, but he acknowledged that support among townspeople
appears light at best. But win or lose, he said he is gratified his
one-man tax revolt has at least spurred civic activism.
   ``I've had several say, `I haven't been to a town meeting in 20
years, but I'm going this time,''' he said.

<HEAD>Plant Closings Law Has Not Created Trauma Business Predicted,
Supporters Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year-old law requiring 60 days' notice for
plant closings and major layoffs is not causing the trauma for
business that opponents predicted, according to economists and the
law's supporters.
   But others say its impact on workers is marginal and that
struggling companies find compliance difficult and confusing.
   The measure was passed by Congress in 1988 amid complaints that
it was an anti-competitive threat to industry. Then-President
Reagan, who allowed it to become law without his signature, called
it a ``ticking time bomb'' for companies.
   ``I don't see any devastating effects on businesses,'' said Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts Democrat who pressed the issue
during his failed presidential campaign. Dukakis said the advance
notice lets state economic development officials try to find new
buyers to keep troubled companies in business.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago, said, ``The legislation was not as onerous as had been
feared'' and has not harmed the nation's economy.
   Greg LeRoy of the Midwest Center for Labor Research, a
Chicago-based consulting group that studies plant closings, noted
there is no move to repeal or change the law.
   ``They've got no horror stories they can trot out to Congress
that would compel anyone to change it. Now maybe we can lay all the
malarkey to rest and move on to the more substantive issues, like
severance pay, health care and retraining workers,'' LeRoy said.
   But Renee Reymond, the National Association of Manufacturers'
chief lobbyist against the measure, said the law ``has been as
complicated and confusing and difficult as we expected.''
   The law requires 60 days' advance notice of plant closings by
employers with at least 100 fulltime workers if the shutdown will
cost 50 or more employees their jobs. Advance notice of a layoff is
required if the number of affected workers totals either 500 people
or 33 percent of the company's employees, whichever is lower.
   ``You can't always give notice. It's very hard to predict when
things are going to come up. Companies who are struggling to
survive don't know what their situation is going to be down the
road,'' Ms. Reymond said.
   ``This law has not been the saving grace for American workers,''
she said.
   Even supporters acknowledge that although the law provides two
months' paid notice, it can't provide long-term help to workers in
areas where there are no other jobs available.
   When a Florsheim shoe factory in Hermann, Mo., closed last year,
there was no other major employer in the town of 2,700 able to give
the 250 displaced workers a job.
   The closing was announced before the Feb. 4 effective date of
the law, but the company chose to provide advance notice anyway,
said Joan Saurez, who heads the Southwest region for the
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union.
   Patricia Gentry, who worked at the Hermann plant for 16 years,
said the advance notice ``gives you a chance to prepare yourself,
so you can think straight, figure out what to do.''
   She found out through employment counseling that she could get
government help to return to school, and she now is working toward
an accounting degree.
   Federal figures showed that before the law took effect, 64
percent of the nearly 2 million workers idled annually received no
notice, and of those who did, white-collar workers received 14
days' warning and blue-collar workers got seven days' warning.
   The government has not yet studied the law's effect because
states, not the federal government, keep track of the notices.
   In the past year in one of the largest industrial states, Ohio
officials received 160 notices affecting about 23,000 workers. Of
those notices, about two-thirds were plant shutdowns and the rest
were layoffs.
   Officials speculate that many of those notices came from small
firms that did not have to comply.
   ``Companies feel an obligation to provide the notice, even if
they don't have to,'' said Reuven Carlyle, a spokesman for Ohio
Gov. Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said the law has created
``a subtle pressure on businesses to help in the transition ...
Once you announce it, you don't have time to just cut and run. It's
been a net plus.''
   Still, others said neither workers or businesses have been
affected a great deal.
   ``We had one side saying they're going to save the world with
this and on the other, that it would destroy us. I think it's
turned out no one was right,'' said Illinois Gov. James Thompson, a
Republican.

<HEAD>Siberian Baritone Makes Stirring Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Out of the remote reaches of Siberia, a young
singer has leapt onto the international music scene _ a baritone of
such promise that at age 27 he seems on the verge of becoming a
superstar.
   His name is Dmitri Hvorostovksy, and at his U.S. debut recital
Sunday night, he showed that much of the excitement is justified.
   Hre is a voice of splendor, supple and powerful at the same
time, tinged with a dark, mellow beauty over virtually the entire
baritone range. His only discernible weakness is in the very
highest register, around G, where he sounds less secure. He also
has phenomonenal breath control, giving him the ability to sing
long phrases without gulping for air.
   For his program, Hvorostovksy chose all Russian songs, half
Tchaikovsky and half Rachmaninov. No doubt he felt most at home in
this repertoire; still, more variety would have been welcome _ too
many of the songs were slow, mournful lamentations over hopeless
love or worldly misfortune.
   But there were striking moments and some first-rate
interpretations: Tchaikovsky's familiar ``None but the lonely
heart,'' was nicely restrained; the same composer's ``Don Juan's
Serenade'' had a streak of cruelty as well as bravado. And
Rachmaninov's ``Christ is risen!'' seemed deeply felt in its cry of
anguish.
   The real revelation came at the end, when Hvorostovksy performed
three operatic arias as encores: one from Rachmaninov's ``Aleppo,''
and one each from Verdi's ``Un ballo in maschera'' and ``Don
Carlo.''
   Here, the young Siberian's voice rang out with a thrilling,
hall-filling grandeur that prompted wild cheering from the capacity
audience at Alice Tully Hall.
   Hvorostovsky, who grew up and studied in the city of
Krasnoyarsk, first came to international attention last June when
he won the Young Singer of the World competition in Cardiff, Wales.
Tapes of the BBC telecast of his performance there have circulated
widely _ winning him admiration for both his voice and his matinee
idol looks.
   Before returning to Europe, Hvorostovsky will repeat Sunday's
program in Washington on March 10. He has signed a recording
contract with Philips and is rapidly getting booked up by
orchestras and opera companies.
   One hopes he won't take things too fast _ 27 is still very
young, and his voice surely cannot have reached its full
development.
   But if he gets the right coaching and management, one can easily
imagine that a few years from now he will virtually own the great
baritone roles on record and on stage.

   President Bush, back from summit talks where
he pledged a ``global partnership'' with Japan, now faces the
challenge of proving he can act on his vow to turn around the U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   Even as the president headed back Sunday from the meeting with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt complained that the summit
appeared to be another case of good intentions but no specific
actions to improve the $49 billion annual trade deficit with that
country.
   ``Nothing has changed,'' Gephardt said.
   But the Missouri Democrat said the increasingly protectionist
Congress will wait until summer for concrete action from the two
leaders' promises, before it considers trade sanctions against
Japan.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher acknowledged Sunday that,
``At the end of the year, if there aren't some major changes in
that, we'll know it was more rhetoric.''
   But, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' program, Mosbacher voiced optimism there would be
results.
   Officials described the weekend talks as political in nature
rather than formal negotiating sessions.
   Kaifu pledged cooperation to answer U.S. concerns that the
political push needed to advance trade reforms had been sidetracked
by the recent election campaign in Japan.
   Trade negotiators face a June 18 deadline to produce agreement
on removing Japanese barriers to supercomputers, satellites and
forest products. Failure of those talks would open the door to U.S.
retaliatory sanctions.
   The two leaders announced no specific measures to further those
talks or the stalled Structural Impediments Initiative talks that
are aimed at reforming economic practices that obstruct sale of
U.S. exports to Japan.
   But they promised to move those talks forward.
   Kaifu said he was ``determined to firmly tackle the structural
reforms,'' including product standards, building codes and other
barriers that effectively block sales of U.S. products in Japan's
market.
   Bush said Japan is ``very aware of the mood and concern in this
country about the continuing impediments to further growth of our
trade relationship.''
   ``Make no mistake about it _ I want to see that deficit come
down, not by restricting our markets or managing trade, but by
further increasing our exports to Japan,'' he said.
   Gephardt, a tough proponent of retaliation measures, voiced
skepticism.
   ``How many of these press conferences have we seen over the past
10 years?'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' show. ``What you
never hear is a specific goal, an action that both sides are going
to take to deal with the problem.''
   Gephardt said Bush should have insisted on setting goals with
Kaifu _ ``How much are we going to get the trade deficit down a
year and how specifically are we going to do it?''
   Until the United States takes a firmer line on such targets, the
trade relationship will not improve, he said.
   For the newly elected Kaifu, the meeting offered a chance to
bolster his weak political support at home.
   Bush carefully chose his words for a two-pronged message _
first, lauding the cooperation of the United States and Japan in
such areas as aid to the emerging democracies in East Europe and
Latin America.
   ``We talked about how we can expand even further our global
partnership,'' he said.
   Secondly, Bush nudged Kaifu on the trade question, letting him
know what was expected if that partnership was to continue.
   The president said he took the opportunity ``to be just as clear
as any congressman would have liked me to be on what needs to
happen.''
   Mosbacher said the summit's major result was that ``both our
governments, for the first time ... realize we both have things to
do to close the gap. We've admitted we have problems and are
starting to work to bring them together.''
   Bush is sending Mosbacher later this month for trade talks in
Tokyo. He also directed Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
meet with the Japanese foreign minister to develop a ``trialogue''
with Europe on global foreign policy and economic decisions.

<HEAD>Soviets Face Tobacco Shortage as Planners Would Rather Eat Than
Smoke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is running out of tobacco to
meet the rising demands of cigarette smokers, according to an
Agriculture Department report.
   Although the Soviet Union is the world's third-largest tobacco
producer, this year's harvest is expected to be only 215,000 metric
tons, unchanged from 1989. The peak was 350,000 tons in 1985. Only
China and the United States produce more.
   ``Major acreage reductions are taking place in Moldavia, the
major tobacco producing republic, in order to increase food
production,'' the report said. ``Although the Soviet government
calls for a mandatory six-month supply of tobacco, limited supplies
have reduced stock levels to barely a three-month supply.''
   Since 1970, tobacco smoking in all forms has increased 70
percent, according to official Soviet figures. In 1988, it was
estimated that there were 70 million smokers, spending an
equivalent of $11 billion annually.
   A government anti-smoking campaign has been waged since Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, including a smoking ban on
all domestic air flights and in some work places.
   ``However, public interest in reducing the level of smoking
seems low,'' the report said. ``Smoking is quite acceptable in the
Soviet society, even with the awareness of its potential hazards.
Domestic demand for tobacco increase slightly in 1988, with retail
sales growing 2 percent.''
   The report was written by Laura R. Davis, a tobacco analyst in
the department's Foreign Agricultural Service, and was included
last week in a review of the world tobacco situation.
   Currently, the Soviets rely on other centrally planned countries
for imports of cigarettes and other manufactured tobacco products,
the report said.
   In 1988 almost 55 billion cigarettes were imported, with more
than 95 percent coming from Bulgaria. Residual suppliers included
Cuba, India, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United States.
   But imports of unmanufactured tobacco leaf has declined to less
than half of the peak years in the early 1980s.
   Comparatively, U.S. tobacco production last year was 641,460
metric tons, about three times larger than Soviet output. And U.S.
cigarette production, at 685 billion ``pieces'' last year, was 80
percent larger than the 380 billion produced by the Soviet Union in
1988.
   What happens next is uncertain, the report said. Lacking hard
currency, the Soviet Union will probably continue importing tobacco
and tobacco products through reciprocal agreements.
   ``Although the government has thus far been unsuccessful in
curtailing cigarette consumption, future attempts may succeed in
lowering the demand for tobacco products,'' the report said.
``Meanwhile, the Soviet Union's reduction in tobacco production and
imports, while consumer demand remains high, will continue to draw
down (inventories).''

   Making changes in the amount of cropland
farmers must idle in order to qualify for federal price support
benefits can have little effect on total production, according to
an Agriculture Department report.
   The annual land-idling is provided by the acreage reduction
program, or ARP, in the various annual commodity programs.
   To qualify for benefits, farmers might have to idle 5 percent or
10 percent _ or even 40 percent _ of their acreage for a specific
crop. Under the usual arrangements, farmers are not paid for land
idled in the ARP but have to comply if they want price supports and
deficiency payments on the remainder.
   The department's Economic Research Service said in the March
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine that switching ARP levels in
the feed grain program would produced mixed results.
   Theoretically, it said, if the ARP was increased to 40 percent
from 5 percent the previous year, federal spending would be reduced
by $4.7 billion and net farm income by $2.8 billion.
   But feed grain production _ mainly corn _ would be reduced by
only about 5 percent.
   ``Falling program participation rates, combined with more
intensive use of permitted acres, are behind these results,'' the
report said.
   The participation rate in the programs was said to be the most
important variable in switching to different ARPs.
   ``Participation in the corn program, for example, would drop
from 80 percent to 43 percent if the feed grain ARP were raised
from 5 percent to 50 percent,'' the report said.
   In all, with a 50 percent ARP for feed grain, the program
acreage would decline to 24 million acres from nearly 78 million.

   Wine drinking in Japan hasn't reached the
levels of other industrialized nations, but an Agriculture
Department observer says changes may be underway.
   ``Both the mass and upscale wine markets seem ripe for growth,''
said Laverne E. Brabant, U.S. agricultural trade officer in Tokyo.
``For upscale markets, U.S. exporters have found success by
upgrading their lines to include premium labels.''
   Brabant said in the March issue of AgExporter magazine that
Japanese consumers are new to wine shopping and that marketers
``should concentrate on educating the public about the superior
qualities of these more expensive products.''
   Japanese wine industry sources believe larger imports of bottle
wines will be needed, Brabant said. Growth is forecast at annual
rates of 15 percent to 30 percent for the next several years.

<HEAD>High School Students Test Drug Free; ACLU Says Cost High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARRELL KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BENNINGTON, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at Bennington High School are
100 percent drug free and proud of it. But the peer pressure that
has kept the school clean has taken away youngsters' privacy, a
civil liberties expert says.
   The entire student body volunteered for a countywide drug
testing program, and all 75 students learned last month they
passed. Now they wear special T-shirts, walk with their heads high
and cash in on discounts at local stores.
   ``I just hope that they start doing this drug test all over,''
said 15-year-old sophomore Christie Wilson.
   Rebecca Foster, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said the organization opposes testing
without reason to suspect a student is using drugs.
   ``People right now seem to be willing to compromise their civil
rights if they think they can clean up the drugs in America,''
Foster said. ``The ACLU's not for drugs, but we don't support drug
testing.''
   Students at Bennington have their reasons, however, for
participating in the program in this town of 300 people about 150
miles from Oklahoma City.
   ``A lot of people around here always said Bennington school has
a drug problem,'' Miss Wilson said. ``We wanted to prove that
everybody here's not taking drugs. It feels good to say you're from
Bennington now.''
   Other students said they, too, are proud Bennington is the only
one of 10 Bryant County schools that tested drug free.
   ``We think it should be a big deal,'' said 17-year-old junior
Jeff Henson.
   Katy Morris, education coordinator for Bryant County Youth
Services, said about 1,400 students in the county have taken the
tests, and only about a dozen failed. Bennington, she said, is the
only school at which all the students agreed to give a urine sample.
   ``There's a lot of peer pressure for the kids to remain clean,''
said Olan Ispell, superintendent of the Bennington School District.
   Ispell said students who pass receive a drug-free ID card good
for discounts at restaurants, bowling alleys, video stores and
other establishments.
   Students who fail on subsequent, random tests, lose their cards
and their discounts. The school's counselor is informed, and not
parents, police or teachers. But when a student has to pay full
price at one of the discount establishments, word will spread the
student failed the test, Ispell said.
   This, Ms. Foster said, is a violation of privacy. ``The students
are submitting to peer pressure to submit to drug testing,'' she
said. ``It's giving up their total right to any kind of privacy
whatsoever.
   But people in Bennington apparently don't see this as a problem.
Mrs. Morris said her organization has not had a complaint. Neither
has the ACLU.
   Drug use in Bennington appears small in comparison to big
cities. But Ispell said students and faculty members would be
concerned even with a few instances of drug use.
   Mrs. Morris said every month, 10 percent of the students must
submit to random testing. Students who fail are given counseling
and lose their cards but receive no other disciplinary action.
   Ispell said the program builds a positive image; he said
Bennington students wear their black and green ``Drug Free Youth''
T-shirts with pride.
   ``There is a drug problem,'' he said. ``School officials who
tell you they don't have a drug problem are kidding themselves.''

<TEXT>
   A huge poaching raid that startled this
poor town of 800 a year ago may actually have helped prompt an
artistic and economic renaissance, some community leaders say.
   A local artist is making a religious shrine. Two
bed-and-breakfasts have opened. Empty buildings are being
renovated. Plans are being made for cottage industries using the
skills of local artisans.
   Allen C. Manzanares, director of the state-funded Costilla
County Economic Development Council Inc., thinks the raid has had a
positive effect on a town where one of every four or five people is
unemployed.
   ``It caught the attention of the rest of the state, and of Gov.
(Roy) Romer,'' who got funding for development council, said
Manzanares, whose family has lived here for many generations, as
have most San Luis families.
   ``We want to put it behind us, and I think generally we have,''
he said. ``The community has started to recover from it. ... How do
we turn something negative into a positive?''
   Last March 6, more than 100 state and federal wildlife officials
converged on San Luis and nearby Chama and Fort Garland. They
arrested 57 alleged poachers in the culmination of a 2{-year sting.
   An undercover officer had posed as a taxidermist and wild game
processor, set up shop and bought elk, deer, bear and other game
hides and carcasses, many taken out of season, as well as
endangered birds of prey.
   Of the 57 people arrested, the cases of three are still pending,
charges against four were dismissed, and seven were fined and
sentenced to prison terms of up to eight months. The others pleaded
guilty and were fined.
   San Luis, in an arid valley at 7,900 feet, was founded in 1851
by descendants of Spanish colonists. It is Colorado's oldest town,
and like neighboring San Pablo, San Pedro and San Francisco, the
area's heritage, culture and geography have isolated it.
   The closeknit community remains nearly 90 percent Hispanic.
   ``People here take care of each other,'' said the Rev. Patrick
Valdez, the Roman Catholic priest who is one of the chief
architects of the town's renaissance.
   ``There is no hunger but there is poverty. If there is an
illness or a death, they do take care of each other.''
   San Luis' awakening has come from within.
   Valdez has renovated a convent left in disarray since the 1950s,
turning it into a handicraft gallery and a bed and breakfast,
appropriately called El Convento.
   The gallery is ``the incubator of a whole series of cottage
industries,'' Valdez said.
   ``What I anticipate is that the artisans will start off here and
when they get big enough they will be able to open their own
businesses and open their extra rooms into shops or their garages
into workshops,'' he said.
   Also planned are the town's first motel and a furniture factory
employing local artisans. The town sponsored workshops for artists
and artisans last summer and plans more this summer.
   At the center of activity is a shrine being built on a hill
overlooking the village. The Stations of the Cross _ images that
depict Christ's final suffering, crucifixion and burial _ will be
placed along a nearly mile-long path that hairpins to the top of a
volcanic rock-strewn mesa west of town.
   The stations, to be dedicated in May, are being rendered in
bronze by artist Huberto Maestas, who also plans to open a San Luis
foundry that will employ several residents.
   Valdez saw the poaching case as a setback to an overdue economic
recovery for the region, but said, ``I'm very optimistic about the
future.''
   ``I think it (the recovery) was going to happen. I think the
raid was a stumbling block in our way that we have to jump over.
And it would have been better if it hadn't ever happened.''

<HEAD>Democrats Aren't Seeking the Governor's Endorsement This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Democratic aides are asked if they are
seeking Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' endorsement for their candidates
this year, their first reaction is to laugh, mumble something
unintelligible or give a ``no comment.''
   Their reaction suggests just how far the governor has fallen
since he ran for president in 1988.
   When Dukakis appeared to have a good shot at the White House,
state Democrats were all too happy to have their name associated
with him.
   Now, with the state's worsening budget problems, Democrats
running for statewide office are wary of appearing too closely
associated with him.
   Even Dukakis has joked that the best favor he could do for one
Democratic candidate for treasurer, House Speaker George Keverian,
would be to endorse the Republican opponent, Joe Malone.
   Dukakis press secretary Mindy Lubber said the governor has no
plans to endorse any Democratic candidate in the primary.
   ``Obviously, post primary, he will be far more active in the
race,'' Lubber said. ``For the harmony of the Democratic party, his
position has always been he's going to stay out of a primary
fight.''
   There's no doubt that at one point, during the height of his
popularity, Democrats would have lined up to court Dukakis'
support, said Paul Watanabe, head of the political science
department at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
   ``The level of positive support at the height of the Dukakis
administration was remarkable, and the fall has been about as
dramatic as one can imagine,'' Watanabe said.
   This year even Democrats with a long history in state politics
are calling themselves ``outsiders.''
   An endorsement by Dukakis might not be the kiss of death, but it
would probably do a candidate more harm than good, Watanabe said.
   ``My guess is he would not endorse anyone without first
consulting them, and my guess is that the advice being given at the
campaigns at this point is to forgo an endorsement,'' Watanabe said.
   State Sen. Richard Kraus, a candidate for treasurer, said an
endorsement from the governor would probably hurt his election bid.
``The negatives are so high right now,'' he said.
   Former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, one of the leading
Democratic contenders for governor, ``does not really place any
value on an endorsement at that level,'' said Ernie Corrigan, his
campaign spokesman.
   ``It's just not something Frank Bellotti has even thought
about,'' Corrigan said.
   Mark Longabaugh, campaign manager for Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy,
sounded more enthusiastic about an endorsement than officials from
other campaigns. ``We want everybody's endorsement,'' he said.
   John Silber's campaign spokeswoman, Michael Regunberg, said,
``Uh ... uh ... I don't think we'll comment one way or another.''
   Rep. John Flood, a Democrat who was an outspoken critic of the
governor during the presidential campaign, said he would use a
Dukakis endorsement of any of his party rivals against them.
   ``Obviously, it would be used by the campaign as a negative,''
he said.

   Atlantis' astronauts
marveled at the joys of spaceflight after swooping safely to Earth
and ending a classified but not-so-secret shuttle mission that put
a $500 million spy satellite in orbit.
   ``As one of the rookies on board, I just say, `Wow! What a
fantastic experience,''' the pilot, Air Force Col. John Casper,
said after the shuttle touched down Sunday on a dry lake bed runway
in the Mojave Desert.
   NASA crews today were to prepare Atlantis for a piggyback jet
ride home to Florida's Kennedy Space Center on Saturday.
   Preliminary inspection showed 62 of the shuttle's heat-shield
tiles sustained ``dings,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.
   The shuttle made a fiery descent through the atmosphere,
touching down at 10:08 a.m. PST in a landing closed to the public
but open to invited guests and journalists.
   The five astronauts made it to California just ahead of winds
and bad weather that could have delayed the landing. Their launch
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Wednesday was delayed five times by
weather, a computer glitch and a sore throat suffered by the
shuttle commander, Navy Capt. John O. Creighton.
   ``I probably had the world's most famous cold,'' he said.
   Ground-to-shuttle communications were blacked out during the
flight, the 34th by a shuttle and the sixth dedicated to the
Pentagon.
   About 4{ hours after landing, Casper, Creighton, Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Pierre Thuot, Air Force. Col. Richard Mullane and Marine Lt. Col.
David Hilmers said goodbye to 100 NASA employees and friends at
Edwards Air Force Base.
   Then the astronauts rode two jets home to Houston, where they
were greeted by 200 cheering spectators.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the astronauts
Thursday deployed a satellite to snoop on much of the world,
including the Soviet Union, by taking highly detailed photographs
and eavesdropping electronically.
   A network of amateur astronomers reported seeing both the
shuttle and the satellite speeding overhead.
   The shuttle triggered characteristic twin sonic booms close to
its landing strip, but police over a wide area of Southern
California reported a lack of the usual calls from citizens who
mistake the noise for earthquakes.
   That suggests the shuttle flew an unusual route as it crossed
the coast at a point NASA would only say was somewhere north of Los
Angeles.
   ``We did something that was important for the country,''
Creighton said. ``Everything went very well. We enjoyed doing it.''
   He also joked about the secrecy, telling the Houston crowd:
``Here I'd thought we'd sneak in in the middle of the night and
nobody would know we were back.''
   Unable to discuss mission details, the astronauts gushed about
traveling in space.
   ``All the preparations, all the discussions with the guys and
girls that have gone before me just couldn't quite prepare me for
what ascent is like,'' Thuot said. ``I was in awe.''
   Mullane, who previously announced he would retire after this
flight, said wistfully: ``I will be sitting there and watch space
shuttles fly into space, and I'll envy that.''
   The next shuttle flight is set for April 12, when Discovery is
to begin a five-day mission to deploy the $1.55 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.

   The city that welcomes the elite of the nation's
college students is having a woeful time trying to educate its own
young people.
   Boston schools have been called among the worst in the nation _
even by the people who run them. The city must now find someone
willing to tackle the job since the bitter ouster of the district's
first black superintendent.
   Whoever slips into the superintendent's seat will be asked to
halt a high dropout rate, reform discredited school policies,
settle simmering labor disputes and ensure schools are safe for
both students and teachers.
   He or she must bring together a racially divided School
Committee, recruit dedicated teachers and balance a budget in tight
economic times.
   Meanwhile, the kids need to be educated.
   Four years ago Laval Wilson was going to do all that. But the
School Committee is now buying out the last 18 months of his
contract and members charge Wilson made little headway in school
improvement. Wilson contends he met the committee's goals.
Recriminations _ including charges of racism _ have been traded
among committee members like taunts from opposing sides at a
football game.
   High dropout rates, poor basic skills and disruptive home
environments are not unique to Boston. But many education experts
say the relatively small Boston system _ 55,000 students in a city
of nearly 600,000 _ does not face the overwhelming problems of
mega-systems in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   In fact, said Anne Wheelock of the Massachusetts Advocacy
Center, which has made numerous studies of Boston schools, Boston
has the conditions for success.
   ``We have an extremely active business and university community
that provide resources. We have a relatively small number of
schools,'' she said. ``We have an excellent staff-to-student ratio
in the middle schools.''
   Even State Education Commissioner Harold Raynolds Jr., who has
called the Boston schools among the worst managed in the country,
contends the system is ``inherently manageable.''
   Why is success so elusive for Boston city schools? State and
city education officials and national experts point to a
combination of factors, including Boston's political history,
recent immigration and an insular Yankee mentality.
   Boston's dropout rate is often cited in assessing the school
system, which is about one-quarter white, with the rest mostly
black and Hispanic.
   Figures from 1987-88 indicate that 43 percent of all ninth
graders drop out in the next four years. More than half of all
Hispanics entering ninth grade drop out.
   Dropout rates in Pittsburgh and San Diego, two cities of similar
population and school size, have lower rates; Pittsburgh has a
four-year rate of 22 percent, San Diego a three-year rate of 21.2
percent.
   Only 37 percent of Boston seniors go on to college, compared
with 54 percent in Pittsburgh. More than 10 percent of Boston's
students are held back every year. Students are suspended at a rate
one and a half times the national rate.
   Boston's problems may not be for lack of dollars. Expenditures
per pupil in 1986-87 total $4,982; in San Diego, the amount is
$3,950.
   Harvard education professor Vito Perrone said the system's
problems date to the 19th century and the city's political
structure. Traditionally a high proportion of Boston students have
gone to private, not public schools, thus decreasing the political
stakes in improving public education, he said.
   About 25 percent of Boston's school-age children do not go to
public schools. In Pittsburgh, with its long tradition of Catholic
schools, the figure is about 26 percent, in San Diego only about 9
percent.
   In 1974, federal orders to desegregate Boston schools through
busing contributed to white flight to the suburbs. Busing created a
climate of distrust and racial tension that has lingered, said
Perrone.
   ``There's a history of mistrust. That's another way of saying
racial issues,'' said Charles Glenn, state director of education
equity.
   Glenn also said education suffers because of tension between
state government, which is influenced by Massachusetts' old
families, and city government, which is dominated by immigrant
ethnic groups.
   ``There's never been a sense of, `Hey, this is our system. Let's
get on with it and really make it really superb,''' he said.
   Wheelock said an insular mentality contributes to a reluctance
to try new programs or seek outside solutions. ``In Boston we have
not adopted practices that researchers and pioneers in education
have demonstrated are effective with kids,'' she said.
   In particular, she cites Boston's high rate of flunking
students. Holding students back is an archaic practice that leads
to more dropouts, Raynolds said.
   Raynolds' goals for the school include giving individual schools
more leeway in setting policies and curriculum and a greater
emphasis on pre-school and vocational education.
   But he and other experts stressed the need for parents,
businesses and other parts of the community to participate.
   ``Public education is at a crossroad,'' said John Kellogg, a
staff member of the Boston-based National Coalition of Advocates
for Students. ``It is viewed by the country generally as having
failed students and parents, and education advocates have an agenda
for change.
   ``It's clear that agenda is being advanced. Boston is among
those areas where change is coming last.''

   With Atlantis safely back on Earth,
NASA turns its attention to the April launch of shuttle Discovery
with the Hubble Space Telescope, the biggest observatory ever to be
put in orbit.
   The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built, will offer a view of the universe with a
clarity 10 times greater than what now can be achieved from the
ground.
   That's comparable to the impact of Galileo's telescope nearly
four centuries ago, according to Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist.
   ``Whenever you make that kind of leap in sensitivity and
resolution, you suddenly are able to see parts of the universe that
are only fuzzy to you at the moment,'' Fisk said. ``That increase
in clarity will give real insight into how the universe works which
we don't now have.''
   The Hubble Space Telescope will be suspended in orbit 370 miles
above Earth for 15 years, studying stars and galaxies as they
existed 14 billion years ago. The universe is believed to have been
formed 15 billion years ago with an explosion known as the Big Bang.
   The 25,000-pound, 43-feet space telescope, named after the late
American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered the expanding
universe, will peer into the heavens from above Earth's atmosphere.
This will enable the instrument to detect light of all wavelengths
from distant stars before it is absorbed or distorted by the
atmosphere.
   The first large optical telescope in space will look seven times
more deeply into space and detect objects 50 times fainter than the
best ground-based observatory. Its 8-foot primary optical mirror is
the most precise ever made.
   Astronomers hope to ascertain the size of the universe and
uncover some of the mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black
holes, among other things.
   One of the more pressing questions _ are there other solar
systems and, if so, are they inhabited _ may have to wait for an
even more sophisticated telescope capable of detecting planets
around other stars. Already, NASA is looking ahead to this
so-called ``Son of Space Telescope.''
   Scientific information should be forthcoming one to two months
after Discovery's liftoff on a five-day mission April 12, said Bill
Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer.
   Crews at Kennedy Space Center planned to move Discovery to the
mammoth assembly building today to be joined to the solid rocket
boosters and external tank.
   The space agency can concentrate on that mission now that
Atlantis is back on Earth, having put a spy satellite in orbit. The
shuttle landed Sunday in California's Mojave Desert.
   Fisk said he expects interesting observations to be made
``fairly early just to show everybody it works.'' But, he said,
``the real insight, the real in-depth study of astronomy will come
back over a period of years.''
   The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, five
years after receiving initial funding, but technical problems
postponed liftoff until 1985 and then 1986. The Challenger
explosion in 1986 delayed the mission until 1989, and concern over
the shuttle's solid rocket boosters pushed it back yet again.
   NASA has taken advantage of the delays to improve the telescope.
   ``We ought to have an orbiting telescope that is much easier to
take care of over the long period,'' Taylor said. ``All of that
comes at some price. The biggest penalty is some of the components
have aged. That in and of itself is not and should not be a real
concern.''
   The launch schedule for the rest of 1990:
   May 9 _ Columbia, which will deploy an ultraviolet astronomy
laboratory called Astro 1 to examine hot stars, quasars and galaxy
centers.
   July 9 _ Atlantis, with a secret Pentagon payload.
   Aug. 29 _ Columbia, with a life science laboratory that will
conduct biological research.
   Oct. 5 _ Discovery, which will unleash the space probe Ulysses
to explore the sun's polar regions.
   Nov. 1 _ Atlantis, to deploy the Gamma Ray Observatory, which
will explore gamma ray sources throughout the universe.
   Dec. 12 _ Columbia, on the first International Microgravity
Laboratory mission.
   Eight shuttle flights are scheduled in 1991 and a record 12 in
1992.

<HEAD>``Miss Saigon'' Heads Olivier Nominations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Miss Saigon,'' the first major musical about the
Vietnam War, led the nominations for Britain's Laurence Olivier
awards, London's equivalent of New York's Tony Awards.
   The show, now in its seventh month on the West End and due to
bow on Broadway early next year, earned five nominations, including
best musical, best actor in a musical (Jonathan Pryce), best
actress in a musical (Lea Salonga), and best director of a musical
(Nicholas Hytner, also nominated for his production of the play
``Ghetto'').
   By contrast, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Aspects of Love,'' expected
to be its principal rival, earned no nominations.
   Eclipsing it in the best musical category were, in addition to
``Miss Saigon,'' Trevor Nunn's short-lived production of ``The
Baker's Wife'' and two ongoing shows: ``Buddy,'' a musical about
American singer Buddy Holly, and ``Return To the Forbidden
Planet,'' a rock musical version of Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.''
   The awards, for which nominations were announced Sunday, are
sponsored by the Society of West End Theater and named for the late
great British actor, Lord Olivier. They will be announced April 8 _
the night ``Aspects of Love'' opens on Broadway.
   Nominated for West End play of the year were William Nicholson's
``Shadowlands,'' a stage version of an earlier television film;
Joshua Sobol's Holocaust drama ``Ghetto,'' a flop on Broadway last
May; David Hare's ``Racing Demon,'' about four south London
clergymen; and Alan Ayckbourn's ``Man of the Moment,'' the prolific
author's 36th play.
   Trevor Nunn's landmark staging of Shakespeare's ``Othello''
earned three nominations _ for best director, best actor (Ian
McKellen, also cited for his performance in a revival of the
American play ``Bent'') and best supporting performance, male or
female (Zoe Wanamaker).
   Besides McKellen, the best actor nominees were Michael
Pennington (``The Wars of the Roses''), Oliver Ford Davies
(``Racing Demon''), and Nigel Hawthorne (``Shadowlands'').
   Prunella Scales, who played Sybil Fawlty in TV's ``Fawlty
Towers,'' was nominated for best actress for her performances as
actress Coral Browne and as Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's
double bill ``Single Spies.''
   The other nominees in her category are Sheila Hancock
(``Prin''), Jane Lapotaire (``Shadowlands''), and Fiona Shaw for
three performances: ``Electra,'' ``As You Like It,'' and ``The Good
Person of Sichuan.''
   American plays received relatively few mentions. The London
premieres of ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' and ``Frankie and Johnny
In the Clair de Lune'' were ignored. ``M. Butterfly'' got one
nomination _ for G.G. Goei as best newcomer _ as did ``Anything
Goes,'' for Elaine Paige as best musical actress.
   But the comedy of the year category included both Robert
Harling's ``Steel Magnolias,'' and Richard Nelson's ``Some
Americans Abroad,'' now playing at Lincoln Center in New York.
   Alfred Molina was nominated for comedy performance of the year
for his role as a Hollywood hustler in David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow.'' His competition includes Michael Gambon (``Man
of the Moment'') and Peter O'Toole (``Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell'').

   The free haircuts, bike repairs and other
services offered by thousands of people at roadside stands were
part of an official Communist campaign to revive the spirit of a
selfless soldier-hero dead nearly 30 years.
   As declared by the Chinese Communist Youth League last month,
Sunday was national ``Learn From Lei Feng Day.''
   Chinese were supposed to do good deeds in honor of the soldier,
killed in 1962 when he backed his army truck into a utility pole.
   Lei's deeds are legendary in China, where everyone knows the
stories of how the young soldier washed and mended his comrades'
clothes, gave his rations away and read the works of revolutionary
leader Mao Tse-tung wherever he went.
   But skeptics question the official story because of the
suspicious existence of photographs of Lei doing good deeds that he
supposedly performed in secret.
   Shortly after Lei's death, Mao made him famous with an
inscription to ``learn from comrade Lei Feng.'' For years, every
child was taught to follow ``the Lei Feng spirit'' of being ``a
rustless screw'' in the socialist machine.
   In the recent years of reform and opening to the outside world,
the Lei Feng spirit was considered old-fashioned.
   Since last year's massive pro-democracy movement, however, the
Chinese leadership has sought to summon back the old spirit of
selfless sacrifice for the nation, and has dusted Lei off and put
him back on a pedestal.
   But few of those fixing bicycles and watches, mending clothes,
handing out fliers on prevention of infectious diseases, taking
blood pressure and offering advice on fixing household appliances
said Sunday they were motivated by Lei's example.
   In Beijing, where Lei Feng activities also were to mark 200 days
before the Asian Games, most people said they were motivated by a
desire ``to bring glory to the nation'' by helping prepare for the
September sports event.
   Few seemed to wonder how cutting hair or fixing bikes
contributed to Asian Games preparations.
   Gui Dalu, a 50-year-old repairman, acknowledged the futility of
what he and his 100 colleagues were doing.
   When asked why they were picking up trash at the Asian Games
village six months before the event, Gui said, ``In fact, we were
just discussing that ourselves.''
   Of Beijing's 10 million residents, hundreds of thousands
participated in organized ``voluntary service'' activities,
according to Sunday's Beijing Evening News.
   Much of the activity seemed pointless. Gangs of college students
with pickaxes hacked at earth near an overpass, but planted
nothing. Schoolchildren marched up and down bicycle lanes near
their schools waving banners.
   The day was more festive than productive. Bright, colorful flags
and banners with exhortations of every kind _ Learn from Lei Feng,
Warmly Welcome Asian Games, Be A Civilized Driver, Protect the
Environment _ filled street corners and dotted the roadsides.
   At the Asian Games village, officers of the People's Armed
Police banged on drums and crashed cymbals, while a police trio at
the Beijing Railway station serenaded the crowds with a mix of pop
and patriotic songs.
   The hype for Lei Feng Day had been building for weeks. His name
began reappearing in newspapers after last year's pro-democracy
movement was brutally suppressed, and an intense campaign to drum
up enthusiasm for Lei Feng Day began in January.
   Among the stories that have filled Chinese newspaper and
television reports daily is one claiming that even cadets at the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point are studying Lei Feng and that
his portrait hangs in a prominent position among military heroes at
the academy.
   West Point spokesperson Andrea Hamburger told The Associated
Press, ``There is no specific part of the curriculum at West Point
that discusses Lei Feng. ... This seems to be a rumor that's gotten
out of control.''

<HEAD>Machinists Rally On First Anniversary of Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Machinists union members held out little hope of
getting their Eastern Airlines jobs back as their strike began its
second year today, but they aim to hold out ``one day longer'' than
company boss Frank Lorenzo.
   ``At the beginning of the strike, there was a lot of waiting to
get it over with,'' said Jim Bertram, a former flight simulator
technician who was among hundreds of protesters rallying outside
Eastern headquarters here Sunday.
   ``Now all I want to do is see Lorenzo burn.''
   Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. bought Eastern four years ago and he
has been the focus of the nationwide strike over wage and work-rule
concessions.
   Police estimated at least 500 people rallied in Miami on the
strike's anniversary Sunday.
   Hundreds more strikers and supporters rallied at Logan
International Airport in Boston, LaGuardia Airport in New York and
in other cities with large Eastern union memberships. Strikers
rallied Saturday at Atlanta.
   In Miami, protesters _ most wearing bright red union T-shirts _
rallied next to the union hall, across the street from Eastern's
corporate headquarters. Police guarded the company buildings, some
of which were splattered red and yellow by paint bombs and had
windows broken out.
   The strikers chanted ``One day longer,'' meaning they hope to
endure one day more than Lorenzo.
   They then went by bus to Miami International Airport to march
through the Eastern terminal.
   ``The enthusiasm and determination and spirit of the real
Eastern employees has not wavered one bit,'' Charles E. Bryan,
president of Machinists District 100, told the crowd. ``It's become
a cause for justice.''
   But in Boston, chief steward Leo Romano admitted being downcast.
   ``I can't lie and say that spirits are high at this point, but
the flying public was out there today and I think they see what we
really are,'' Romano said.
   ``We're not a group of radicals. We're a group of people
dedicated to a cause.''
   Most Machinists, who at Eastern represented mechanics and other
maintenance worker, have gone on to other jobs, in most cases for
less pay.
   Though there seems to be no serious hope for settlement of the
strike, the Machinists said they are showing they won't give in to
what they call Lorenzo's union-busting and dismantling of Eastern.
   ``I think basically the accomplishment of the strike is a
philosophical, idealistic one,'' said Elaine Segura, a 20-year
Eastern veteran clerk who struck with her husband, Paul, a 23-year
mechanic. ``These people who have suffered for a year still have
the enthusiasm and perseverance. The answer to Lorenzo is still
no.''
   The strike virtually shut down Eastern at first when pilots and
flight attendants joined the nearly 9,000 Machinists.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days
later and began hiring new workers while trying to rebuild as a
smaller carrier. Today, Eastern has 18,000 employees, compared to
more than 30,000 before the strike, and 800 daily flights, compared
to nearly 1,100 when the strike began.
   The carrier is losing $2 million a day as it struggles to emerge
from bankruptcy protection. The pilots and flight attendants ended
their sympathy strikes three months ago, but Eastern has taken only
a few back, saying it has no openings.
   Management did not mark the strike anniversary, spokesman Robin
Matell said. ``The bottom line is a year later, there are no
winners, only losers,'' Matell said. ``There were an awful lot of
people who got hurt.''

<TEXT>
   In 1946, Zbigniew Szadkowski's parents
were rousted out of the Soviet-annexed Polish Ukraine and moved
west, to settle the emptied formerly German lands of Poland's new
frontier.
   Now these aging refugees and the children they bore on the
forfeited German territories east of the Oder and Neisse rivers are
haunted by fears they might be swept away once again _ this time by
a resurgent, united Germany.
   ``They are afraid about the border,'' said Szadkowski. ``These
are people who lost all their property, everything, in the East.
Now they are afraid their children will lose everything again.''
   ``It is Polish history,'' he added, with a shrug.
   Szadkowski, a middle-aged Polish army lieutenant serving in the
border guard, is standing on the Bridge of Friendship. Behind him
is the East German city of Goerlitz, in front of him the Polish
town of Zgorzelec.
   Below him is a dirty brown swath of the Neisse River, the
natural boundary used to create a man-made border that divided the
German city in 1945.
   In a 1950 pact, East Germany confirmed Poland's western border.
Two decades later, West Germany also formally recognized the
Oder-Neisse border.
   But the quest to regain lost lands has lingered in some German
hearts and, now that Communist rule has collapsed and the two
Germanys are striding toward reunification, the muddy Neisse seems
a thin and vulnerable line.
   Many Poles are reminded of another Polish border, across which
German troops crashed in 1939 to unleash six years of Nazi horror.
   Poland's government is demanding that the Oder-Neisse border be
guaranteed before German reunification, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of West Germany has refused to give an unequivocal promise on the
border.
   Kohl must face voters in December and, with polls showing him
running just a few percentage points ahead of the opposition Social
Democrats, apparently does not want to alienate conservative
supporters.
   Many West German politicians, even leading figures of Kohl's
governing coalition such as Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, favor guaranteeing Poland's western border before
reunification.
   But Kohl's murky stance has fed feelings of anxiety in this town
at the western edge of the land ceded to Poland by a defeated
Germany _ land that comprises one-third of modern Poland.
   ``The older people especially are afraid of this reunification
... Life teaches that history often repeats itself,'' said Zbigniew
Daniluk, an economist and Zgorzelec Solidarity leader.
   As World War II ended, more than 12 million ethnic Germans were
expelled from newly Polish territories and transported west.
   The victorious Allies had allowed Stalin to give the land to
Poland in exchange for the greater territory he took from Poland in
the east and annexed to the Soviet Union. Poles were never
consulted.
   There is bitterness in some German quarters about the severing
of long-nurtured German ties to lands now labeled Poland's
``recovered territories'' _ a reference to Polish prior ownership
of the land in the Middle Ages.
   Trepidation about German unification is widespread in Poland,
but is particularly acute for those who resettled in formerly
German territories after leaving the eastern lands seized by the
Soviets.
   Forced to repopulate the new western region stretching from
Baltic coast to Zgorzelec and south, these Poles have long lived
with a sense of impermanence.
   ``This fear is well evident in the small (formerly German)
villages which are not restored and are not neat and tidy,'' said
Walery Wysoki.
   ``People, for all this time, have been wondering whether they
will stay here forever, or not.''
   His father, who had lived in eastern Poland and was forced by
the Soviets to labor as a miner in the Soviet Caucasus, settled in
Zgorzelec in 1956.
   In Zgorzelec, there is a sense of artificial division, a feeling
that the town could so easily become united, and German, again.
   The trolley rails that linked the two sections of the prewar
German city are still embedded in the bridge over the river border.
On both sides of the river the archetecture is turn-of-the-century
German.
   The soaring cathedral is in Gorlitz, as is the old heart of the
city. Zgorzelec, says Szadkowski, ``doesn't have a real center like
every Polish town.''
   Poles returning from jobs or vacations on the west side of the
border describe anti-Polish sentiment surfacing: a restaurant
refusing service or a store posting a sign, ``Toys for German
children only.''
   In western Poland, grafitti demanding ``Germans go home'' has
appeared on bus stop walls.
   It has long been easier for East Germans to enter Poland on
shopping forays than it is for the Poles to go west, and Germans
have developed a reputation in Poland as rapacious consumers of
scarce goods.
   And yet a Polish-German familarity has also been spawned by the
border traffic _ ``We have shared a few vodkas,'' says Szadkowski _
and a common sense of new freedom after casting off Communist rule.
   Local Poles remember that when East Germans swam the Neisse last
year, seeking to reach the West through the fracturing East bloc,
the people of Zgorzelec welcomed them with dry clothes and lifts to
the West German embassy in Warsaw 300 miles away.
   Now thoughts are focused on whether the Warsaw government can
wield enough international influence to ensure the Neisse remains
the permanent border.
   It is an emotion-stirring question. Solidarity parliament leader
Bronislaw Geremek recently told a Paris audience that it would take
a war to change the border.
   Said Wysoki, ``Simply, we will not allow them to do it.''

<TEXT>
   A group of Oneida Indians faced trial in
federal court today on charges of seizing a reservation bingo hall
and burning it down in a dispute over alleged profit skimming.
   Nine residents of the 32-acre Oneida Indian Reservation were to
stand trial. Four other Oneida Indians from Canada were indicted in
the takeover of the $1 million-a-month operation and the arson but
were never arrested.
   Seven are charged with pilfering $60,000 in bingo hall profits
during the takeover, while seven are charged with conspiring to
burn down the hall in 1988. A new bingo hall is expected to open
this spring.
   The 800-seat bingo hall that opened in 1985 was hailed by
supporters as way to generate revenues for reservation schools,
services and other improvements. It provided jobs for nearly 100
people.
   However, another faction contended the hall did not have the
blessing of the entire tribe and was not approved by the Iroquois
Confederacy Grand Council, to which the Oneidas belong.
   In late 1987, William Beglen and other dissidents began
questioning what had become of the bingo profits, estimated at
between $28 million and $43 million. They accused the hall's
operators of embezzlement and seized the hall.
   Stephen Lance Cimino, who is representing Beglen, said the
defendants did not set the fire. He addded, ``There was a lot of
money involved, and there was no accounting of it.''

   Andy Rooney returned after a three-week
suspension to his end-of-the-show slot on ``60 Minutes'' to take up
the ``demeaning'' job of defending himself against charges he is a
``racist bigot.''
   At the same time, the 71-year-old humorist let it be known
Sunday night he would not be silenced. ``Do I have any opinions
that might irritate some people? You're damn right I do. That's
what I'm here for,'' he said.
   Rooney was given a three-month suspension without pay from CBS
News President David Burke on Feb. 8 after a gay magazine, The
Advocate, quoted him as saying blacks had ``watered down their
genes'' because the least intelligent had the most children. Burke
later cut short the suspension.
   Rooney, who has repeatedly denied making the remarks in the
magazine interview, which was not tape-recorded, said on ``60
Minutes'' he spent a lot of his suspension worrying he'd be
remembered as the bigot he isn't.
   ``I'd be known for the rest of my life as a racist bigot and as
someone who had made life a little more difficult for homosexuals.
I felt terrible and I've learned a lot,'' he said.
   At the time of his suspension, Rooney was under fire for a
letter in which he said he found gay sex ``repugnant'' and for a
CBS special Dec. 26 in which he put ``homosexual unions'' on a list
of things that cause ``self-induced'' death.
   ``What do I say to defend myself? Do I say, `I'm not a racist'?
That sounds like saying, `I'm not a crook,''' he said in his return
broadcast. ``How do I apologize to homosexuals for hurting them
with a remark I made that I didn't realize would hurt them?''
   He said it found it ``demeaning to have to sit here and defend
myself'' against allegations of racism. He cited among other things
the night he threw out a guest for using the word ``nigger'' and
his arrest while in the Army during World War II for insisting on
sitting in the back of a bus with black soldiers.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
last week said it was satisfied that the racial remarks attributed
to Rooney were distorted and didn't reflect his views. The group
declined to comment on Sunday's broadcast.
   Craig Davidson, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation, applauded Rooney's comments.
   ``Mr. Rooney's anecdotal remarks contain an acknowledgement that
his statements about gay people were unfair and harmful,'' Davidson
said Sunday. ``That is what GLAAD has sought all along and we
welcome it.''
   CBS said it got more than 5,000 calls asking for Rooney's return
to ``60 Minutes,'' which has ended most broadcasts since 1978 with
Rooney's wry commentary.
   The program got high ratings in his absence but dropped to 18th
place last Sunday against a rerun of ABC's hit ``America's Funniest
Home Videos.''
   Roy Brunett, a CBS News spokesman, said the network would not
know how many calls it received about the broadcast until some time
today.
   Rooney ended his broadcast in usual wry fashion, telling his
viewers that the suspension had given him time to lose weight.
Holding up before and after photographs that showed he hadn't lost
any weight, Rooney said, ``If I'd only had two more months.''

   A decorated FBI agent who took part in a
discrimination lawsuit against the agency has been suspended and
stripped of his security clearance amid allegations of espionage,
it was reported today.
   Colleagues of Fernando E. Mata, 48, told The New York Times that
the allegations against the 15-year veteran and counterintelligence
specialist are unjustified and that he appears to be a victim of
retaliation for the lawsuit.
   The newspaper reported that Mata, who is based in Miami, lost
his clearance as a result of a three-year investigation.
   FBI spokesman Robert Davenport in Washington confirmed only that
Mata had been placed on administrative leave. He would not say why.
   An FBI official who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity
said that ``no matter what you think of the FBI, it's ridiculous to
think'' the agency would retaliate by making such a serious
allegation.
   Mata aided in several major FBI investigations to counter spying
by foreign countries. Co-workers said he risked his life in covert
assignments.
   An unidentified friend of Mata's told the Times that the FBI
claimed to have information that Cuban agents had approached Mata
and sought to enlist him as a spy.
   An affidavit filed in the discrimination lawsuit in which Mata
was a plaintiff showed Mata had requested psychiatric care after a
traumatic stint as an undercover foreign counterintelligence agent,
but that the FBI refused to grant security clearance to a
psychiatrist outside the bureau.
   ``What the bureau is doing to Fernando Mata is unspeakable,''
said Leo A. Gonzales, an FBI agent who retired last year. ``There's
no doubt in my mind that Fernando is a patriot and a loyal
American.''
   Gonzales told the Times that the allegations appeared to be a
maneuver to force Mata out.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton of El Paso, Texas, ruled in
1988 that the FBI had demonstrated a widespread pattern of
discrimination against its Hispanic employees in both promotions
and working conditions.
   The FBI was ordered to make sweeping changes in its policies.
   Mata's attorney, Hugo A. Rodriguez, said Mata has been
repeatedly questioned about the possibility of contacts with Cuban
intelligence agents several years ago.
   ``They haven't told us what he's being charged with,'' said
Rodriguez. ``He has not done anything wrong. He has not compromised
the interests of his employer or the government.''
   Rodriguez said it was unlikely Mata could be charged with
espionage because he was granted limited immunity from prosecution
in exchange for agreeing to undergo lie-detector tests and other
questioning last year.
   Mata in 1983 won the Attorney General's Award, the highest award
given by the Justice Department. Friends said the work that
prompted the award is classified.

   The 7,500 workers on strike against 11 major
hotels are threatening to picket other hotels.
   ``There's a number of hotels that we do business with that also
have operations here as well as on the mainland, and we may be
looking at expanding our picket lines in front of those hotels as
well,'' Tony Rutledge, leader of Local 5 of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees Union, said Sunday.
   The workers went on strike over wages Saturday after their
leaders rejected an offer from the Council of Hawaii Hotels. The
old contract expired Wednesday.
   The strike has forced the cancellation of room service and
entertainment at some resorts, and some tour buses have refused to
enter hotel property to pick up passengers.
   Management personnel were being flown in to help temporary
workers, who were doing the work of bellhops, maids and cooks.
   The 11 hotels account for one of every five hotel rooms in
Hawaii and two of every five in Waikiki, the state's main tourist
destination.
   No talks have been held since picket lines went up. Federal
mediator Frank Shoeppel said it may be a week before he calls the
sides back to the bargaining table.
   The Kahala Hilton, where only one restaurant was open and no
room service was available, offered 25 percent discounts for the
inconvenience.
   Even so, some guests, including comedian Robert Klein, said they
would have canceled if they knew they would be crossing a picket
line.
   ``They're nice people and I think they're entitled to a good
wage,'' he said.

Attempt</HEAD>

   Gunfire crackled through a northern
provincial capital today as troops searched for a governor charged
in the bloody December coup attempt whose followers fought the army
to prevent his capture.
   A general and at least 13 other people were killed in Sunday's
fighting, which broke out after suspended Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo
refused to surrender.
   Aguinaldo, who fled during Sunday's fighting in Cagayan
province, was indicted last week on charges of rebellion and murder
in connection with the bid to topple President Corazon Aquino that
claimed 113 lives.
   Today, officials ordered the arrest of three mayors, one village
chief and a lawyer for supporting Aguinaldo.
   In Tuguegarao, capital of Cagayan 250 miles north of Manila,
government forces conducted house-to-house searches today but
failed to locate Aguinaldo. Sporadic firing continued until late
morning and tension in the city was high.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters today she ordered the armed forces to
arrest Aguinaldo ``using such force as is necessary but taking all
feasible measures for the safety of civilians.''
   Among the dead in Sunday's fighting was Brig. Gen. Oscar
Florendo, sent to Tuguegarao to negotiate with Aguinaldo. He was
among officials trapped in a hotel seized by Aguinaldo supporters,
who Mrs. Aquino said killed Florendo before fleeing the hotel.
   ``The act of cowardice and treachery of Aguinaldo's followers
will not go unpunished,'' Mrs. Aquino said after those trapped in
the hotel were freed.
   Casualty figures were incomplete, but regional commander Col.
Miguel Fontanilla said at least 14 people died, including 10 killed
during a clash at a checkpoint near a bridge, three in fighting
near a gasoline station and Florendo at the hotel, he said.
   The decision to arrest Aguinaldo has been widely seen here as
part of the government's effort to display strength in cracking
down on those suspected of involvement in the six armed attempts to
topple Mrs. Aquino since she took office four years ago.
   But share prices closed 1.38 percent lower today on The Manila
Stock Exchange. Traders said investors feared a new wave of
political unrest in the wake of the Tuguegarao bloodshed.
   In a statement to news organizations, mutinous soldiers
responsible for the December coup attempt deplored Florendo's death
but declared support for Aguinaldo.
   ``We call upon the Filipino people to express their indignation
and rejection of the illegitimate (Aquino) regime before our
beloved nation is torn apart,'' the statement said.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered troops to
capture Aguinaldo ``at all costs.''
   Aquinaldo, who told a Manila radio station on Dec. 1 he was
sending tanks and artillery to the city to support mutineers trying
to oust Mrs. Aquino, was indicted Tuesday on rebellion and murder
charges along with opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and five
others.
   Enrile appeared in court today in suburban Quezon City, but his
arraigment was deferred until the Supreme Court rules on the
validity of the charge.
   The high court is expected to hear arguments Tuesday on Enrile's
contention that a 1956 Supreme Court decision invalidated the dual
murder-rebellion charge.
   Marines were flown from Manila on Sunday to reinforce security
in Tuguegarao, a city of more than 80,000 people. Philippine
Airlines canceled flights to the city and schools were ordered
closed today.
   Acting provincial Gov. Melvin Vargas said Aguinaldo's forces
released about 30 hostages taken late Sunday. De Villa said 227 of
Aguinaldo's followers had been arrested, including 63 members of a
military-backed militia raised, trained and equipped by the Aquino
administration.
   Florendo and Local Governments Secretary Luis Santos had gone to
Tuguegarao to convince Aguinaldo to surrender. But he refused,
saying he should be charged only with rebellion because he killed
no one.
   Rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years' imprisonment and
defendants are allowed bail. Murder with rebellion carries a life
sentence and is non-bailable.
   Before dawn Sunday, Aguinaldo's supporters surrounded the
six-story Delfino Hotel in Tuguegarao and took Florendo, 51, and
three aides prisoner and trapped Santos and others on the second
floor.
   Thousands of Aguinaldo's supporters poured out into the streets
around the hotel and set up makeshift barricades near the hotel.
   Aguinaldo, dressed in combat fatigues and brandishing a weapon,
appeared before them at the hotel to rally support.
   Aguinaldo was also implicated but never charged in a August 1987
coup attempt. Later, he raised a private army, ostensibly to fight
Communist guerrillas. He ran for provincial governor in January
1988 and was elected by a landslide.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains, Stocks Lose Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained more ground against the Japanese
yen today despite heavy central bank intervention, and the weak yen
helped push down share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders
said.
   The dollar closed at 149.95 yen, up 0.20 yen from Friday's close
of 149.75 yen. It opened at 150.15 yen and traded above the 150-yen
mark most of the day, ranging between 149.90 yen and 150.30 yen.
   In recent days, the dollar has been at its highest level since
closing at 151.30 yen last June 15. With a few pauses, it has
gained 5.43 yen since Feb. 19.
   In today's stock trading, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 227.98 points Friday, fell 212.36
points, or 0.62 percent, closing at 33,845.20.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's strength in New York on
Friday contributed to its gains in Tokyo today.
   ``The dollar's strength remains unchanged,'' said Norio Takeda,
a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo. ``But it doesn't seem like it will
rise sharply at this time.''
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan sold large amounts of dollars in
support of the yen, but the exact amount was not known. The central
bank does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   Market players were anxiously watching whether there would be
joint market intervention with other countries' central banks,
including the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, they added.
   President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reportedly
discussed the matter in their meeting Friday and Saturday in Palm
Springs, Calif.
   ``The general perception of the market was that no significant
agreement was reached at the meeting, but the market is somewhat
nervous about whether the two leaders agreed to intervene jointly
or not,'' said a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank.
   The market also was watching whether the Bank of Japan would
raise its official discount rate before Yasushi Mieno, the bank's
governor, leaves Wednesday on a nine-day European trip, the Bank of
Tokyo's Takeda said.
   An increase in the discount rate, the interest charged for loans
to commercial banks, has been expected for the last two weeks, and
traders have cited this as one reason for the recent decline in
Tokyo share prices.
   Securities dealers said the yen's weakness sent the Nikkei
falling despite some active buying by private investors.
   ``There were some private investors actively buying shares
because they thought share prices had fallen enough, but
institutional investors remain sidelined because of uncertainties
in the currency and bond markets,'' said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bond prices rose slightly, however. The benchmark government No.
119 issue rose 0.20 yen and closed at 87.02 yen, with the yield
down 0.040 percentage points to 7.120 percent.
   Dealers said the Nikkei also was pushed down by computer-guided
selling by arbitrageurs, who seek profits from price differences
between different markets, for example the spot and futures
markets. A fall in the Nikkei futures index led to sales in the
spot market, they said.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated
at 400 million shares.

<HEAD>Shamir: As Many Soviet Immigrants As Possible In East Jerusalem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says Israel does
not consider Jewish neighborhoods in predominantly Arab East
Jerusalem to be settlements and will try to direct as many Soviet
Jews to the area as possible.
   Shamir was responding to statements by U.S. leaders, among them
President Bush, who linked American aid for immigrant resettlement
to a halt in Israeli settlement activity in the occupied
territories and Jerusalem.
   ``There are no settlements in Jerusalem,'' Shamir declared in a
speech to Jewish fundraisers. ``It is part of Israel and it will
never be divided again.''
   Shamir later explained to reporters that he made the statement
``because some people are talking about settlements in Jerusalem. .
.. The great, the big suburbs of Jerusalem like Gilo, and Ramot,
and Ramat Eshkol _ for them they are settlements.''
   ``For us, they are part of Yerushalaim,'' Shamir said, using the
Hebrew name for the Holy City. ``We want to have as many Soviet
Jewish olim (new immigrants) in Yerushalaim as possible.''
   Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war, and has declared the unified city _ home
to 350,000 Jews and 130,000 Arabs _ its capital.
   Most Western countries, including the United States, do not
recognize that claim and say the status of Jerusalem should be
determined in negotiations. Recent U.S. statements, however, seemed
to go beyond that point by objecting to Israeli housing projects in
East Jerusalem.
   Tens of thousands of Israelis live in new neighborhoods built on
the outskirts of East Jerusalem since 1967. The population of Gilo
alone, for instance, now reaches 30,000.
   However, the Israelis living there do not get the same financial
incentives _ tax deduction and cheap housing _ as those living in
the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   His statements came as the government was debating its response
to U.S. proposals for starting Middle East peace talks.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, trying to work out a
compromise between Israel and Palestinians, who demand an
independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, has suggested
including an East Jerusalem Arab in preliminary peace talks with
Israel.
   Israeli hard-liners oppose the idea, saying it would amount to
negotiating the status of Jerusalem.
   Referring to Baker's stand on Soviet immigration, Shamir said he
hopes Baker would ``reconsider his position and change it.''
   On Thursday, Baker said the United States could not extend a
$400 million guaranteed loan to Israel for housing for Soviet Jews
if they were settled in the West Bank or in Gaza or if Israel
continued its settlement projects there.
   Israel, which receives $3 billion in annual American aid, says
it needs the extra money to accomodate the wave of Soviet Jews,
expected to reach 80,000 to 100,000 this year. Some Israeli
officials say as many as 230,000 may come.
   Shamir created a furor in the West and the Arab world by
suggesting Israel needs to retain the occupied territories to house
Soviet immigrants.
   The government later said it had no policy of directing
immigrants to Jewish settlements in the occupied lands, where some
200 Soviet Jews have settled in 1989.
   Amid mounting Arab protests over the influx of immigrants, the
government last week announced that Soviet immigration figures must
be submitted to Israel's military censor prior to publication.

   These are days of delicious irony
for Enrique Bolanos, days a decade in coming.
   Bolanos, one of Nicaragua's leading businessmen and Sandinista
critics, was stripped of his business by the leftist Sandinistas.
   Many people like Bolanos left Nicaragua long ago, convinced
there was no place for them in a Sandinista state. But Bolanos
stayed, a tenacious critic to the very end.
   ``I wanted to see them crying,'' he says softly. ``I wanted to
see them crying and crawling.''
   His wait was rewarded last week when a pro-business, pro-U.S.
opposition coalition led by now President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in the general elections.
   One of the key planks in the United National Opposition's
platform is privatizing as many confiscated enterprises as possible.
   A few miles away and a pole apart from the cool, dark study
where Bolanos savors fate's intricate twists and turns, a
Sandinista party official sits in Bolanos' old business office.
   An AK-47 assault rifle leans against the wall.
   ``We're not giving up a shred of this,'' Esteban Corea says.
   Corea, 35, runs what used to be SAIMSA in the days when it
belonged to Bolanos. Now it is a state-owned and operated
agricultural business with 1,800 workers named after the brother of
President Daniel Ortega, Camilo, who died in the revolution.
   ``The business has 60 rifles, most of them AK-47s. But many of
the workers have AKs at home as well,'' Corea says.
   It would be nice, he says, to have more weapons to fight off
anyone who tries to privatize the confiscated company with its
cotton gin, its airport, its farms and its cattle.
   The Sandinistas have said they'll hand over power. But
unpredictability is a Sandinista hallmark and they have vowed to
``defend the gains of the revolution'' despite repudiation at the
polls.
   Bolanos isn't sure the Sandinistas will be able to let go after
more than 10 years in power.
   ``They are stashing arms everywhere. In the city, in the
country, everywhere,'' Bolanos says. ``It is going to be very
violent, Nicaragua, very dangerous. Everyone has weapons.''
   He says it calmly, quietly, like a survivor.
   Bolanos, 61, was president of the Superior Council of Private
Enterprise, the nation's leading business group, from 1982 to 1988.
A tenacious and outspoken critic of Sandinista economic policy, he
was jailed, put under house arrest, threatened and finally, in
1985, stripped of his business.
   ``They told me it was punishment, that I has misbehaved,'' he
says with a dry little chuckle.
   ``But it wasn't punishment. A punishment is something that is
deserved. This was revenge. Pure revenge.''
   Bolanos, a likely candidate for a top Cabinet post, would like
at least some of SAIMSA's assets back and compensation for that
which cannot and, he says, should not, be returned, such as land
now occupied by peasants.
   Peasants are one thing. Bolanos' arch-foes are another.
   He savors the dilemma of the top Sandinista comandantes, people
like Ortega or Interior Minister Tomas Borge, ensconced for a
decade in comfortable homes confiscated from affluent capitalists.
   ``Did you see that story in the paper how the comandantes are
afraid they'll lose their homes?'' Bolanos says. ``THEIR homes it
said.''
   These homes _ some even call them modest mansions _ are now
state property. And suddenly the Sandinistas aren't the state
anymore.
   ``They thought they'd be in power forever,'' Bolanos says.
   The Sandinistas, he says, will have to watch the tools they
fashioned used to undo much of what they built in the name of
revolutionary reform and military expediency.
   ``The president has the powers of an emperor in the
constitution. It's as though Daniel Ortega thought he'd be
president forever,'' Bolanos says.
   ``Just wait. He'll be the one now asking for a change in the
constitution.''

   Lobbyists and lawmakers aren't the only fat
cats hanging around the Capitol as the Legislature meets in special
session.
   A self-described ``basic bleeding-heart cat lover'' has been
providing veterinary care to an assortment of felines who make the
Statehouse grounds their home. She hopes to find people to adopt
them.
   Diane Odegard, a clerk for the Senate Journal, said at least
five cats _ some of which, to be fair, are actually rather slim _
have been prowling around the Capitol for more than a year.
   ``Sometimes in the morning they'll be sitting out sunning
themselves,'' she said. ``Sometimes they'll be sitting on the steps
of the Capitol just like they belong there.''
   Ms. Odegard and Capitol parking attendants believe some of the
cats were abandoned at the legislative hall as kittens last winter
and have survived on squirrels and pigeons _ plus a little help
from Captol workers.
   ``As it turns out, a lot of us have apparently been feeding
them. I'm sure we all thought we were the only ones,'' Ms. Odegard
said. ``You'll walk around the Capitol and see a plate of cat food
here and there.''
   Nevertheless, she said the irregular feeding, exposure to the
weather and danger from cars and people prompted her to try to
improve the cats' lot.
   Ms. Odegard and Carolyn Seelig, another Capitol employee, have
been taking donations to have the cats vaccinated and neutered. So
far, Ms. Odegard said, she has trapped and altered three cats and
has found one male tabbie a home.
   Strays still hanging about the halls of power include a female
tabbie and a female calico, both altered, and three males _ a
tabbie, a large white cat and one with black and white fur.
   ``There may be more than we think. This may be fairly futile,''
Ms. Odegard said.

<HEAD>Mongolian Reformists Stage Biggest Rally Yet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Up to 10,000 Mongolians rallied in their capital
in the largest gathering yet of opposition groups seeking
democratic reform in the world's second-oldest Communist country, a
foreign source said today.
   At Sunday's rally in Ulan Bator, representatives of the Social
Democratic Movement announced formation of Mongolia's second
opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, said the source, who
spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Unlike the Mongolian Democratic Party, which was formed last
month and advocates bringing the country to a ``higher state of
socialism,'' the Social Democrats favor an entirely new political
and economic structure based on an end to the Communist monopoly on
power and dependency on the Soviet Union.
   The two groups are the most active of the half-dozen unofficial
political organizations that have sprung up in the past 2{ months
in Mongolia, a vast pastoral land of 2 million people ruled by the
Communist Party since 1921 and long a Soviet client state.
   Sunday's rally was the sixth since late December.
   Some 8,000-10,000 people gathered at about noon in front of the
Lenin Museum, then marched to the Great People's Hural, or
parliament, on central Sukhbator Square, to present a petition to
the government.
   Rallies and demonstrations have been banned at the square, but
there was no attempt to disperse the crowd that gathered there for
about an hour before returning to the Lenin Museum. It was the
second time an opposition rally has been held there despite the ban.
   The protesters delivered a joint petition to the government
demanding a special congress of the Communist Party, formation of a
new party Central Committee, promulgation of a new election law and
election of new deputies to the Hural.
   The petition set a deadline of Wednesday for the government to
respond but did not say what would happen if there is no response,
the source said.
   Speakers reiterated calls for quicker reform and for the
Communist Party to give up its 69-year monopoly on power.
   They criticized Mongolia's economic relations with the Soviet
Union, alleging that Premier Dumaagiyn Sodnom, who just concluded a
six-day visit to Japan, is responsible for unfavorable economic
agreements with the Soviet Union. The groups also called for
Mongolia to withdraw from COMECON, the Soviet bloc trading group.
   There was no police or military presence at the rally, and
police even helped direct traffic when the demonstrators marched to
and from the central square, the source said.
   The gathering drew many young people and families with children,
who played under sunny skies and temperatures near freezing, which
the source described as balmy for Ulan Bator.

   The United States may sharply curtail the granting
of asylum to Nicaraguan refugees because of their nation's switch
to democracy, but there is little chance political exiles already
here will be forced to return.
   In theory, people granted asylum are subject to review each
year, and could have that status revoked, said Duke Austin,
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Washington.
   ``But I know of no single case since political asylum has been
an avenue in the United States when we have involuntarily returned
someone because conditions in their homeland improved,'' Austin
said. ``It's in the law, but it's never been done.''
   What is more likely is that new applicants will get tougher
scrutiny of their applications.
   An estimated 80,000 to 90,000 Nicaraguans are now in the United
States legally, including both political and non-political cases.
Some exile advocates say twice that number actually live in this
country if the count includes illegal immigrants _ many of whom
were hoping to win political asylum.
   In fiscal 1989, the INS granted just under 6,000 Nicaraguan
requests for asylum and denied more than 10,000. Between October
1989 and January of this year, about 500 were granted and 650
denied. But INS reports that some have been dropping their requests
for asylum.
   Most of those voluntarily dropping asylum requests, like Marlene
Falcon, say they are eager to return.
   ``We're here not because we want to be, but because of the
repression,'' she said. ``I couldn't see any use to continue
battling a political asylum claim that didn't have any validity.''
   The INS rules on political asylum in large part are based on
State Department advisory opinions for each case. Most denials
occur because analysts rule applicants are economic, rather than
political, refugees.
   The State Department cautioned it is too early to be assured
that democracy will stick in Nicaragua, but a spokesman said policy
toward asylum will clearly be reviewed.
   Nat Kingsley of the State Department's Human Rights Bureau
emphasized that under U.S. law, each application is treated
individually, whether it comes from England or Albania.
   ``Obviously the conditions within a country play a role, but it
is the individual's relations in that country that are the deciding
factor,'' he said. Teams of State Department analysts are
constantly revising evaluations of many factors in each country,
including its human rights record.
   ``For Nicaragua, it's pretty early to tell how it will affect
asylum,'' Kingsley said, noting that the constitutional transition
is not scheduled to occur until April 25.
   Last year Poland and Hungary were in effect dropped from the
list of nations that violated human rights _ making political
asylum almost impossible.
   ``A few years ago Solidarity people from Poland were granted
asylum almost automatically,'' Austin said. ``Now they're running
the government and we no longer accept applications.''
   In the week since U.S.-backed Violetta Chamorro beat the
Sandinistas' Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua's presidential election,
Miami immigration officials noted the decrease in the asylum
requests.
   Dozens of Nicaraguan exiles have either dropped their petitions
to stay or have stopped fighting deportation.

<HEAD>Drug Lords Call State of Alert, Renewed Attacks Feared</HEAD>

   A week before elections, Colombia's
cocaine barons have declared a ``state of alert'' in a message that
suggests they intend to end a 6-week-old cease-fire in their war
against the government.
   The announcement Sunday by the Extraditables, the name adopted
by the Medellin drug cartel, came a day after President Virgilio
Barco announced he will keep extraditing suspected drug traffickers
instead of trying them in Colombia as they have requested.
   The traffickers declared a unilateral cease-fire Jan. 17 in an
effort to persuade Barco to end extraditions of drug suspects to
the United States.
   The government has not extradited any drug trafficking suspects
since Jan 21 and currently holds sixteen. In the previous five
months of the drug war, it sent 14 suspects to be tried in the
United States.
   Resumption of the drug lords' assassinations and bombings, which
had killed more than 200 people since the war began in August,
could disrupt balloting on Sunday for mayors, city councilmen,
state assemblies and a new congress.
   Campaigning already has been plagued by almost daily attacks by
leftist guerrillas.
   The traffickers did not say what they meant by a state of alert,
but there was little doubt it was a message that more bloodshed may
lie ahead.
   The traffickers' announcement was published Sunday by the Bogota
daily El Tiempo and broadcast by the radio network Caracol.
   Barco has rejected all appeals by the traffickers that they be
given guarantees they would be safe from extradition if they were
to surrender. He reiterated his position Saturday night upon return
from a state visit to Argentina and Uruguay.
   In its fight against the drug cartels, which began after the
August assassination of a leading presidential candidate, the
government has wielded extraditions as its chief weapon.
   It has also tracked down and killed a top Medellin figure,
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, raided drug labs and seized cocaine,
weapons and $38 million in cash, gold and platinum hidden at
traffickers' ranches.
   In their announcement Sunday, the traffickers denied any role in
the recent murders of members of Colombia's leftist party, the
Patriotic Union.
   Diego Montana, president of the Patriotic Union, has blamed the
army and the secret police for killing many of the 72 party members
slain this year.
   In the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla, the headquarters
of many drug traffickers, election officials said Saturday night
that they had discovered that 34,000 voters were paid money for
their votes.
   Some candidates have said traffickers are financing some
campaigns, but no names have been mentioned and no one has been
arrested.
   On Sunday, leftist rebels ambushed an army patrol, killing 12
soldiers, the 7th Brigade said in a statement.
   The ambush by the rebel Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces
took place near the town of San Jose de Ocune, about 250 miles east
of Bogota, the army said.

   If Gianni Versace was daring last season
when he hiked his hemlines 10 inches above the knee, this time he's
darn right fresh with skirts so tiny they no longer cover anything.
   The peek-a-boo effect of the new fall-winter collection
presented in Rome on Sunday was no accident. The flamboyant
designer, favorite son of the showbiz crowd, presented them in a
variety of styles from derriere hugging jersey dresses and skirts,
to elaborately embroidered silk cocktail gowns.
   Also super short was the 1990's Versace version of the loose
trapeze dress first launched in the 1960's.
   Gianni was a bad boy when it came to his evening wear too,
slitting the side of a floor length gown straight up the leg. The
same gown has a plunging backline which joins the slit at the waist
in a single snap. What happens if the snap were to pop is anybody's
guess.
   Apart from a few raised eyebrows, mainly from the staid Milanese
crowd on the first day of the four day ready-to-wear collections,
the general consensus was that whatever Gianni does he does so well
he can get away with it.
   One of the things Versace does best is jeweled embroidery, which
this season he uses heavily to divert attention from the many bare
spots in his collection.
   Thus a tiny A-line silk dress, which is really no more than a
slip, becomes a sumptuous cocktail gown when Versace stiches a
myriad of shimmering crystals and pearls in the form of a heart
down the back or across the front.
   Bustier tops made up entirely of encrusted jewels give substance
to the micro skirt below, while simple silk stretch pants turn into
sophisticated evening wear when decorated with paisely or floral
prints shaped entirely out of rich sequins.
   Plumage on hemlines and waistlines are another filler in the
collection.
   To further make up for the skimpy styles underneath, the Versace
jacket is loose and full with wide sleeve and generous shawl
collar, in bright shades of blue, green, yellow and red.
   Speaking of red, Versace uses cardinal red heavily in his new
winter fashion, throwing down the gauntlet to fellow Italian
designer Valentino, who up to now had the monopoly on the rich and
elegant shade.
   The four-day Italian ready to wear shows got off to a fresh
start Sunday morning with the Emporio Armani (a Giorgio Armani
label aimed at the younger set) fall-winter 1990-1991 collection
full of fun ideas for the chilly months ahead.
   According to Armani, heavy knit sweaters will be worn over
jackets next winter, boots will reach the thigh to protect legs
bared by melon shaped mini skirts and bermuda shorts, and jump
suits will be knitted and worn with a scarf tied around the waist
for extra coziness.
   During the trend-setting Milanese fashion week such top Italian
names as Krizia, Ferre, Fendi, Missoni Gennyi and Byblos will
present their new winter wears. Most of the shows take place in the
fashion pavillion of the modern trade fair on the outskirts of
Milan. However some of the big names in Italian style prefer to
show in more exclusive surroundings.
   The five Roman Fendi sisters have rented an elegant palazzo for
their much awaited fur show Tuesday night, while Armani, the
``numero uno'' of Italian ready to wear, will close the shows
Wednesday night with his label collection presented in the theater
of his downtown Milan headquarters.

<HEAD>New Storm Moves into Rockies; Dry Weather Over Much of U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A snow storm was expected to move into the Rockies today, and
dry weather was to prevail across much of the nation.
   Light rain that fell on parts of the central Plains on Sunday
was to taper off today, as temperatures cooled in the 40s.
   Flurries were expected today over the Great Lakes and Upper Ohio
Valley in a pattern similar to Sunday, when light snow also fell in
northern New England.
   In most of the the Great Lakes and New England Sunday
temperatures dipped to below freezing all day and were expected to
stay there today.
   In the Plains as far north as Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday,
temperatures climbed into the 60s and afternoon highs in the 70s
warmed Florida, southern Georgia and most of Texas.
   The Southwest basked in the lower 80s Sunday.
   A new storm was to spread snow across the Sierra Nevada and
upper Rockies into Colorado today and Tuesday.
   The storm also was to bring rain to western Oregon and northern
California, where snow fell in the region's highlands on Sunday.
   In California, more than a half inch of rain fell Sunday in
Marysville and more than a third of an inch fell at Shelter Cove.
   Skies were fair Sunday from the northern Plains to the southern
Atlantic.
   The nation's high for Sunday was 83 degrees at Buckeye and Gila
Bend in Arizona, and Presidio, Texas.

<HEAD>Government Will Slash Spending, Raise Income, Economy Minister
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its latest drastic attempt to
end hyperinflation, the government says it will fire and retire
civil servants, radically trim bureaucracy and raise taxes and
duties on farm products.
   Economy Minister Antonio Ernan Gonzalez announced the new
package in a nationally televised speech Sunday night.
   He called for public ``support, tolerance and comprehension to
prevent bankruptcy from dragging us into anarchy and social chaos.''
   Banks and exchange houses were to remain closed today to allow
implementation of measures aimed at stabilizing the country's
financial system.
   The government of President Carlos Menem, who took office in
July, has been beset by recession, inflation that soared more than
8,100 percent over the last 12 months, the plunging value of the
national currency, rising interest rates, labor strife and record
unemployment.
   The package Gonzalez announced was approved during marathon
weekend Cabinet sessions. He said the government plans to trim $2
billion from expenses through the retirement and dismissal of
government workers and elimination of state bureaucracy.
   Effective immediately, Gonzalez said, all state workers who have
reached retirement age but continue to work will be retired while
those who are within two years of retirement will be laid off and
paid their salaries until they reach retirement. Vacancies will not
be filled.
   The minister did not say how many state workers would be
affected. State employees now total 2.5 million in a total national
labor force of 12.5 million.
   In addition, the minister said, all 56 government secretariats
will be eliminated and sub-secretariats will be cut from the
current total of 112 to 32, with their duties being taken over by
the ministries from which they now depend.
   Speaking to reporters after the speech, Gonzalez described the
elimination of secretariats and sub-secretariats as the ``most
drastic'' of the new measures and denied that the retirements
constituted ``massive dissmissals.''
   The minister also announced intervention in the management of
the National Development Bank and the closure, effective today, of
the National Mortgage Bank, used principally to finance building of
low-income housing.
   The banks lose tens of millions of dollars a year through bad
loans, poor collections and the political decision to finance
provincial budgets at the expense of the national government.
   Steps also will be taken to solve the problems of a few private
banks that encounter chronic difficulties, Gonzalez said, without
specifying what would be entailed.
   Other steps included suspension for 60 days of payments to
holders of state contracts and continuation of an earlier measure
suspending state subsidies for industrial promotion.
   Gonzalez said the state will raise an additional $600 million in
income through a 1.5 percent increase in the tax on capital goods
and an average 5 percent boost in duties on agricultural exports.
   Guillermo Alchouron, president of the Argentine Rural Society,
which represents the country's leading producers of beef for
export, said the minister's description of the crisis ``was
realistic and impressive'' and recommended postponement of sectoral
complaints ``no matter how just and reasonable they may be.''
   The printing of money to finance the state deficit has been
prohibited, Gonzalez said.
   The minister also announced that all state employees will be
paid a minumum monthly salary of $90, beginning April l.
   Many state employees now earn far less than that amount. The
largest teachers' union announced last week it would strike today,
the first day of the 1990 school year, if the government did not
grant a basic wage of $66 a month.
   Gonzalez made no mention of expected increases in public utility
rates. Fuel prices, however, rose by 124.5 percent on Sunday,
following a Saturday night announcement by Energy Secretary Julio
Cesar Araoz.
   Menem has raised public service rates drastically during his
eight months in office, and pledged to open up Argentina's state
dominated economy by selling public companies, deregulating
monopolies, lowering tariff barriers, raising taxes and cutting
subsidies.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
European trading this morning but gained against the British pound.
Gold prices were steady.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 149.95 yen, up 0.20 yen from
Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar eased to 149.25 yen.
   In recent days, the dollar has been at its highest level since
closing at 151.30 yen on June 15. It has gained 5.43 yen since Feb.
19.
   ``The dollar's strength remains unchanged,'' said Norio Takeda,
a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo. ``But it doesn't seem like it will
rise sharply at this time.''
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan sold large amounts of dollars in
support of the yen, but the amount was not known. The central bank
does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   Other morning dollar rates compared with late Friday:
   _ 1.7035 West German marks, down from 1.7200
   _ 1.5015 Swiss francs, down from 1.5130
   _ 5.7540 French francs, down from 5.8065
   _ 1.9275 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9365
   _ 1,256.50 Italian lire, down from 1,268.00
   _ 1.1915 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1939
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6420, down from $1.6515 late
Friday.
   The pound, under pressure from disappointing trade figures and
the government's declining position in opinion polls, has retreated
steadily from its recent peak of $1.7145 on Feb. 22.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $403.00 per
troy ounce this morning, compared to $403.25 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $403.00, up from $402.50 late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $403.44 per troy ounce, up 70 cents
from Saturday.
   Silver was quoted in London at bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's 5.12.

<HEAD>4,000 Re-enact Civil-Rights `Bloody Sunday,' March to Montgomery</HEAD>

   Civil-rights leaders assessed their
movement's progress as about 4,000 people re-enacted the historic
voting-rights march to Montgomery and ``Bloody Sunday''
confrontation with police on a bridge 25 years ago.
   ``Lord knows we're not where we ought to be, but thank God we're
not where we used to be,'' Hosea Williams said Sunday as he crossed
Edmund Pettus bridge.
   ``We've come a long way. But Lord knows we've got a much further
way to go,'' Williams said.
   From that bridge, named for a confederate general, Williams on
March 7, 1965, first saw the state and local police who ordered the
marchers to disperse, then used billy clubs and tear gas to chase
them back across the bridge.
   The day went down in civil-rights annals as Bloody Sunday.
   About 300 people marched to a point four miles beyond the bridge
and returned to Selma on Sunday night before resuming the 50-mile
trek this morning. Marchers plan to cover the distance in several
daily segments, arriving in Montgomery March 10 for a rally at the
Alabama Capitol.
   After the 1965 clash and the death a few days later of James
Reeb, a white Unitarian minister from Boston who was hit in the
head while on a Selma street, President Johnson made passage of the
Voting Rights Act a priority.
   The Selma-to-Montgomery march took place two weeks later.
   Killed after that march was Viola Liuzzo, a white homemaker from
Detroit shot by night-riding Ku Klux Klansmen while she drove
demonstrators back to Selma.
   On Sunday, as marchers reached the midpoint of the bridge, smoke
was released simulating tear gas. Marchers retreated, some falling
to the ground.
   Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King, widow of slain
civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., were among participants
Sunday. Also marching were Albert Turner, F.D. Reese and U.S. Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., who were among those attacked on Bloody Sunday.
   ``We shed a little blood here that made a difference. People are
now registering to vote,'' Lewis said.
   Jackson told about 600 people at the First Baptist Church that
King did not die and Nelson Mandela did not languish in a South
African prison for 27 years for blacks not to exercise their right
to vote. He said 35 percent of all eligible black voters are
unregistered.
   ``You cannot walk around here with these unused blessings,''
Jackson said. ``God has given us all these votes. When you drop
them they become snakes and go to Washington and bite us.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Hopeful Editorial Not Government Statement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper said today that a
weekend editorial interpreted as a hopeful sign for the release of
Western hostages in Lebanon was the personal opinion of the writer
and not a government statement.
   The statement came amid reports from Damascus, Syria, that a
senior Iranian envoy met with Syria's foreign minister and
discussed efforts to free the hostages. Syria is the power broker
in neighboring Lebanon by virtue of its 40,000 troops there.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the English
daily Kayhan International as saying Western media distorted its
editorial by reading it as an official hint of contacts between and
Iran and Washington over the hostages, who are believed held by
pro-Iranian factions.
   In the Saturday editorial, also excerpted by IRNA, the paper
suggested U.S.-Iranian ties might be improved in the ``post-hostage
era'' if Washington agrees to release three American Moslems
imprisoned in the United States in exchange for two Americans in
Iranian jails.
   But today the government-run paper distanced itself from the
statement, said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``Neither the writer of that column nor the author of this
present one is a government spokesman or employee,'' IRNA quoted
Kayhan as saying. ``No officials of any sort were consulted before
putting pen to paper.''
   ``What was and is now being expressed are privately held
views,'' Kayhan said.
   Western media reports took the editorial as another in a series
of signs from Tehran in recent weeks that a new effort was under
way to free the 18 Westerners held in Lebanon.
   They include eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans,
two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. Most are believed held by
Shiite Moslem factions loyal to Iran. The longest-held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The editorial followed a spate of statements from Iranian
newspapers saying the hostages should be released because they are
fueling propaganda against Iran.
   A Syrian source, who refused to be identified further, said a
meeting Sunday between Mahmoud Hashemi of Iran and Farouk al-Sharaa
of Syria ``appears to be to coordinate efforts between the
governments of Syria and Iran to gain the release of all the
hostages.''
   The source said Hashemi, the brother of Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, had arrived from Beirut, where he met with
senior Shiite Moslem figures on the hostage issue.
   Another source said: ``This appears to be a serious effort, the
first in some time, to end the hostage ordeal. ... But I don't
think we'll see anyone out tomorrow.''
   The Iranian paper on Saturday had suggested that two Americans,
David Erwin Rabham and Jon Pattis, could be released if Washington
freed Dhoruba-al-Mujahid, Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt and Khalifa
Hammas Abdul Khalis, who it identified as ``political prisoners''
in the United States.
   Pattis, a 53-year-old engineer, was arrested in June 1986 for
allegedly passing Iranian military secrets to the CIA for use by
Iraqi bombers in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Businessman Rabham has been in jail for almost 10 years. He was
arrested after a phone conversation with former President Jimmy
Carter when Iranian militants stormed the American Embassy in
Tehran in November 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage.
   Of the three Americans mentioned, Khalis was the leader of a
Hanafi Moslem group that took over three Washington buildings in
1977, holding several hundred people hostage for several days
before surrendering. One person was killed by gunfire from the
group.
   Pratt, the one-time ``defense minister'' of the Black Panthers,
is serving a life sentence for a 1972 murder conviction.

<HEAD>Soldiers Isolate Uzbek City Hit By Rioting, Activist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rioting prompted security forces to seal off a
city in Uzbekistan, where about 30 demonstrators were killed when
soldiers fired on them, an activist said. Officials reported only
the death of one soldier.
   Yadigar Abidov, spokesman for the Uzbekistan grassroots
organization Berlik, said Sunday that soldiers would let no one
leave or enter Parkent, about 30 miles from Tashkent, the capital
of the republic considered the cultural and geographic heart of
traditionally Moslem Central Asia.
   There were conflicting reports over what sparked the violence.
   Abidov said the city was blocked off after a regional Communist
Party leader was stoned to death Saturday by the protesters, who
demanded their own candidate in a local election Sunday. Officials
denied it.
   A newspaper said the clashes broke out after residents demanded
the government move out several hundred Meskhetian Turks who had
fled ethnic violence in the nearby Uzbek region of Bukinsky.
   Grigory Kuplin, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Moscow,
said at least one soldier died in a clash between demonstrators and
Interior Ministry troops Saturday. He said he had no information on
other dead or wounded and knew nothing of a curfew in Parkent, a
city of 200,000.
   The Uzbekistan Interior Ministry and other official sources
contacted in Tashkent refused all comment on the violence. One
national newspaper printed a small report Sunday on unrest, but
other official media, including the official Tass news agency,
provided no information.
   The republic of Uzbekistan has been the most recent area of the
Soviet Union to erupt in violence as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
loosens decades of tight Kremlin control.
   Twenty-two people were killed in rioting in Dushanbe, the
capital of the neighboring Tadzhikistan republic, last month.
Tensions persist in the Caucasus republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan, where hundreds have been killed in the past two years.
   In addition to ethnic tensions, residents of Uzbekistan are
frustrated by low wages in the cotton-growing republic, ecological
devastation, and poor housing exacerbated by large families.
   The Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported Sunday that the
Parkent violence occurred during a meeting of residents demanding
the evacuation of Meskhetian Turks.
   The Turks were forcibly resettled in Uzbekistan from the
Caucasus republic of Georgia by Josef Stalin. In June, they were
targeted in ethnic violence in the Fergava Valley of eastern
Uzbekistan that left about 100 people dead.
   Abidov said the violence broke out when a crowd of Parkent
residents gathered in front of local Communist Party headquarters
Saturday to demand registration of their candidate in runoff
elections to the Uzbekistan parliament.
   Uzbekistan held elections of its parliament Feb. 18 and runoffs
were held Sunday.
   Abidov said Parkent residents were angry that Ismail Salimov, a
regional Communist Party first secretary, had refused to allow any
other candidates on the ballot.
   At one point, soldiers gave demonstrators three minutes to
disperse and when the crowd refused the troops opened fire, Abidov
said.
   In the ensuing pandemonium, some protesters grabbed stones and
began to pelt Salimov and another party official who died as a
result of their wounds, the activist claimed.
   His account could not be confirmed. Kuplin said he had no such
information, and an official with the local Election Commission in
Parkent, who refused to give his name, said Salimov was alive and
voted Sunday.

   Communist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin easily won his
contest but dozens of other local and regional races were headed
for runoffs after old guard Communists in the Slavic heartland
faced their first challenges at the polls, early returns indicated
today.
   Sunday's balloting _ the first contested local elections for the
Russian, Ukranian and Byelorussian republics, was seen as a key
test of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to transform
Soviet politics.
   While the vote was only partially democratic, pro-democracy
candidates were expected to unseat many long-entrenched Communists.
   In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, pro-independence activists
said results in runoff elections Sunday assured them of the quorum
they need to covene the republic's parliament, where activists are
expected to push for creating a mechanism to secede from the Soviet
Union.
   Nearly 150 million voters were registered to choose among more
than 11,000 candidates for 1,800 seats in the legislatures of
Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia. Thousands of seats in local
governing councils were contested.
   Official results were not expected to be announced until
Tuesday, election officials said, but preliminary results showed
that runoff elections will have to be held in dozens of districts
where none of the candidates won a majority of the votes. The
balloting is expected in two weeks.
   Yeltsin easily won a Russian parliamentary seat with 72 percent
of the vote in his home district in the Ural Mountain city of
Sverdlovsk, Anatoly Moisyev, a member of the republic's election
commission, said today.
   Yeltsin hopes to be elected president of the Russian republic by
legislators. That post is currently held by Politburo member Vitaly
Vorotnikov, who also won a seat Sunday with a majority of 71.3
percent.
   The Russian presidency traditionally merits a seat on the
nation's ruling Politburo, and Yeltsin could possibly return to the
ruling body from which he was ousted by Gorbachev in February 1988
for criticizing the pace of reform.
   In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, preliminary results showed
that Communist Party First Secretary Vladimir A. Ivashko, a member
of the Politburo seen as a Gorbachev protege, failed to win a
majority over 11 opponents and will have to stand again in a runoff
election.
   Although Communist leaders have at Gorbachev's urging endorsed a
multiparty system, non-Communist parties are not yet permitted.
``Opposition'' candidates ran Sunday as members of grass-roots
citizens' groups or as reformist Communists.
   ``Our elections involve a new type of people, people who have
been given new impetus from perestroika,'' a relaxed, confident
Gorbachev said after voting. ``The essence of it is that it is a
people's referendum on perestroika.''
   ``Perestroika'' is Gorbachev's name for his program of
restructuring Soviet politics and the economy so the system is more
democratic and the bureaucracy that has strangled the economy is
dismantled.
   In the Slavic republics, reforms _ where they have managed to
get started _ have proceeded more slowly and quietly than in other
areas. There have been neither the concerted drives of the Baltic
republics nor the violence of the Caucasus and Central Asia.
   In the Ukraine's Donetsk coal basin, however, miners went on
strike Friday demanding resignation of the local Communist Party
leadership and complaining that promises made after coal strikes in
the region last summer were not implemented quickly enough.
   Gorbachev has pressed the Communist Party to relinquish its
monopoly on power and pushed for a new, more powerful presidency.
Hundreds of thousands of people have turned out for pro-democracy
rallies.
   Responding to reporters' questions after he voted in Lenin
Hills, the Soviet leader said it was not particularly important
whether the victors in Sunday's elections were Communists.
   The 20-million member party is trying to get much closer to the
people, ``and so the question of proportions is not crucial,'' he
said. ``It is important that people are there who support
perestroika and are prepared to move this process ahead. Communist
or non-party members, all will be good enough.''
   Voters in the Ukraine selected a 450-member Supreme Soviet
legislature, Byelorussia chose a 310-member legislature and Russia
elected a 1,068-member congress that will choose a legislature and
leadership from among its members.
   The balloting in the Slavic republics follows local elections in
Lithuania swept by candidates endorsed by the pro-independence
Sajudis movement, and several other republics.
   Voters in 28 Lithuanian districts cast ballots in runoff
elections Sunday. Runoffs in the remaining 17 districts not settled
in the Feb. 24 election will be held later in the week, the
official Tass news agency said.
   On Sunday, at least nine deputies to the Lithuanian Supreme
Soviet were elected, eight of them supported by the
pro-independence movement Sajudis, said Longinas Vasiliauskas, a
Sajudis spokesman. Two-thirds of the 140-member parliament must
have been elected before a session can be called.
   Observers have speculated that Sajudis wants a quick parliament
session so Lithuania can vote to secede from the Soviet Union
before Gorbachev gains his expected broad new powers, which include
the right to suspend republic parliaments and send in troops.
   The Soviet Congress meets in one week to consider Gorbachev's
proposal.
   Vasiliauskas said the Lithuanian parliament would not vote to
leave the Soviet Union immediately but wants to create the
mechanism for secession because ``We don't know what Gorbachev will
do after he's elected president.''

   A minor earthquake measuring 3.9 on the Richter
scale shook eastern Idaho but caused no damage, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Geological Survey said early today.
   The temblor, at 11:51 p.m. MST Sunday, was felt by residents of
the Jackson, Wyo. area near the Idaho line, according to Pat
Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif.
   The epicenter of the quake was about 30 miles southwest of
Jackson, Jorgenson said. The last recorded quake in eastern Idaho
was in the early 1980s, she added.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale is considered capable
of causing slight damage in the local area; a quake of 4 can cause
moderate damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

   The 12-year-old girl who is the world's
longest surviving heart-liver transplant remained in fair condition
early today at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Stormie Jones' condition had been upgraded from serious to fair
on Sunday.
   Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, is recovering from her
second liver transplant, which was performed Feb. 20.
   Stormie received a new heart and liver at Children's on Feb. 14,
1984, to control a condition in which her cholesterol level was 10
times higher than normal.
   Doctors decided to implant a new liver after Stormie's first
transplanted liver was damaged by hepatitis caused by an unknown
virus. Her donor heart was not affected by the disease.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor said some kinds of rock
music help trap teen-agers into devil worship, and he disclosed
that two exorcisms have been performed in the New York area within
the past year.
   ``Diabolically instigated violence is on the rise,'' O'Connor
said in his sermon Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   Divorce and abortion are two examples, he told parishioners.
   O'Connor said heavy-metal rock music in particular ``can help
trap people, especially teen-agers,'' into devil worship. He
singled out the song ``Suicide Solution'' by Ozzy Osbourne as an
example.
   The parents of a teen-ager who killed himself while listening to
the song sued Osbourne in 1986. The lawsuit later was dismissed.
   ``I think the industry had better police itself,'' O'Connor told
reporters after the sermon. He avoided calling for music censorship.
   O'Connor described how young devil-worshippers gather in
cemeteries for ``disgraceful'' satanic ceremonies. Such a ceremony
could end in suicide, he said.
   He said the Roman Catholic archdiocese's vicar general,
Monsignor Patrick Sheridan, approved the use of exorcism, a ritual
to cast out an evil spirit, in two recent cases of demonic
possession.
   ``As far as we know they have been successful,'' the cardinal
said.
   Possession ``seems to be very rare ... Psychological, medical
and other causes of what appears to be possession must be ruled
out,'' O'Connor said.
   He said the novel ``The Exorcist'' is a ``gruesomely authentic''
portrayal of demonic possession.

   Nelson Mandela laid a wreath today at a
memorial to those who sacrificed their lives in the independence
war that transformed white-ruled Rhodesia into black-governed
Zimbabwe.
   Mandela, 71, said Zimbabwe's victory was an inspiration to the
people of South Africa, where some 5 million whites wield political
and economic power over a voteless black majority of 28 million.
   Mandela began his fourth week of freedom from South African
jails at the North Korean-built Hero's Acre shrine _ a monument to
the blacks' wartime victory.
   ``Today I have seen something altogether new,'' he later told
South African trade unionists and exiles at the University of
Zimbabwe in Harare, referring to the country's multiracial society.
``And this has convinced me that we are on the threshhold of
something altogether new in our country.''
   ``Nothing can ever stop an idea whose time has come,'' he added,
``and the time of the idea of liberation, freedom and peace has
come in our country.''
   Mandela, now vice president of the African National Congress,
was freed Feb. 11 after more than 27 years in prison for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the Pretoria government.
   President Robert Mugabe, who led the Zimbabwean guerrillas in
the seven-year conflict, declared today Mandela Day, a public
holiday. But many Zimbabweans flocked to work anyway, unaware
they'd been given a day off.
   At a state banquet Sunday night, Mugabe spoke of ``discordant
voices'' being heard in the face of efforts towards peace talks
between the anti-apartheid groups and the white-led government.
   This was a clear reference to the Pan-Africanist Congress, the
ANC's main rival which opposes contacts with Pretoria and pledges
to escalate an armed struggle.
   The ANC, the PAC and the South African Communist Party were all
legitimized by President F. W. de Klerk last month as a prelude to
Mandela's release.
   The ANC, which embraces the Communist Party, has agreed to talks
expected to begin in Cape Town mid-March. But the PAC, which Mugabe
once favored over the ANC, refuses to engage in any discussions.
   Mugabe noted that his own country's independence came as a
result of direct talks between guerrilla leaders and the government
under British chairmanship in 1979. This was after Mugabe himself
was detained by Ian D. Smith's Rhodesian regime for 10 yeers.
   Mandela is due to leave Harare Tuesday for Dar es Salaam, the
capital of Tanzania where most ANC exiles live, before traveling to
Sweden.

   South Africa sent troops into
the Ciskei homeland today to suppress riots by mobs that burned
factories and looted shops after the territory's authoritarian
president was ousted in a military coup.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said his government intervened at the
request of Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo of the Ciskei army, who seized
power in a military coup Sunday in the nominally independent
homeland.
   Doctors at Cecilia Makilwane Hospital said three people had been
stabbed to death and dozens of others injured in the rioting.
   Botha said South Africa intervened after mobs threatened to
attack government buildings in the Ciskei capital of Bisho. He gave
no details and did not say whether South African forces were
involved in fighting with rioters.
   There was no immediate word from Gqozo's junta on the
developments.
   Botha had said earlier that South Africa would not ``entertain
any request'' to intervene. He did not say if South Africa would
recognize the new government in Ciskei.
   More than 50 factories, many of them owned by Israeli and
Taiwanese firms, were set ablaze today as major rioting and looting
flared for a second day in Mdantsane, a sprawling township and
industrial area in eastern Ciskei near the South African city of
East London, officials said.
   Mobs attacked and burned businesses and shops in Fort Jackson,
Dimbasa and Zwelitsa, they said.
   Gqozo said Sunday after the coup that the ultimate aim of the
new government of Ciskei was to reincorporate it into South Africa.
   ``We are looking for a new future,'' he told a news conference.
   Gqozo was flanked at the conference by officials of the African
National Congress, the main South African black anti-government
group, and its allied Mass Democratic Movement.
   He said the coup was aimed at ending widespread violence,
detentions of citizens, corruption and deteriorating education and
health services. Human rights monitoring groups say at least 700
people have been detained in the homeland this year, and about 200
were still in detention Sunday.
   Gqozo said all security forces, including police and prison
service officers, supported the new Council of State.
   But order was not being kept today as hundreds of looters, many
of them drunk, broke into shops, removed the contents and then set
buildings ablaze with firebombs, officials said.
   ``All the shops and factories were burning ... Everybody was
looting and there was complete chaos,'' said an employee at a local
hotel.
   Some onlookers attempted to stop the looting, but the local
police made little effort to intervene, eyewitnesses said, adding
that some shots were fired, apparently by security forces, but
there were no reports of injuries.
   Residents said the factories were a symbol of the oppressive
rule of the old government and people were burning them because of
poor wages and bad working conditions. The previous government
attracted major foreign investment with subsidies and by providing
workers for wages of $50 or less a month.
   But many of the people who looted shops were simply taking
advantage of the lawlessness, others said.
   Botha said South African forces would protect all threatened
property.
   At least two supermarkets and dozens of shops and houses were
burned and looters used wheelbarrows to haul away stoves,
refrigerators and other goods taken from shops, officials said.
   ``Everybody in Mdantsane has TVs now,'' said one man watching
the looting.
   Ciskei, a 3,600-square-mile territory of about 1 million people,
is not recognized as sovereign by any country other than South
Africa.
   South Africa has made it and three other homelands independent
as part of efforts to create separate homelands for blacks, but no
other nations recognize them as independent. Residents in the
homelands lose South African citizenship, but the Pretoria
government pumps millions of dollars into the homelands to keep
them afloat.
   No casualties were reported in Sunday's overthrow of President
Lennox Sebe in which troops seized control of the capital, Bisho.
Sebe was in Hong Kong on a trade mission.
   Jubilant soldiers and civilians danced, sang and embraced in the
streets of Bisho to celebrate the coup.
   Gqozo said Sunday that he and three other officers had formed an
executive committee for a Council of State to run the government.
   The coup leaders arrested Lt. Gen. Kwame Sebe, the president's
son and commander of the defense force's special services; Brig. A.
Sixishe, chief of the defense force; and Brig. Solly Swelindaba,
chief of the army.
   President Sebe, 63, led the territory to independent status in
1981, although a commission had found the majority of residents
opposed losing their South African citizenship.
   The other members of the Council of State were identified as
Col. O.M. Guzana; Cmdt. S.S. Pita; and Maj. P. Hauser, who is
white. There are often white officers in the homeland security
forces, either seconded South African officials, former mercenaries
or immigrants.

<HEAD>Kaifu Defends Summit Results, Says Didn't Cave in To Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told critics in
Parliament today that his summit with President Bush had ``very
good results'' in reducing economic friction and was not a case of
one-sided yielding to U.S. pressure on trade issues.
   ``The United States is willing to have a dialogue with us. Do
you really believe dialogue is bad?'' Kaifu asked Japan Socialist
Party Chairwoman Takako Doi, who delivered a lengthy criticism of
his party's policies.
   ``To avoid going backward, we must continue cooperating,'' Kaifu
said. ``I would like to ask for the help and understanding of the
whole nation in doing so.''
   While ruling Liberal Democratic Party officials saw the summit
in Palm Springs, Calif. as contributing to relations with the
United States, leaders of the Socialist Party, the largest
opposition group, accused Kaifu of weakness.
   ``What promises did you make to President Bush in the United
States?'' Doi asked after charging that Kaifu's trip, on a week's
notice, lacked ``adequate preparation or consultations.''
   On Sunday, Socialist Party Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi
charged that Kaifu had unilaterally yielded to Bush's demands for
economic reform in Japan aimed at slimming this nation's $49
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Kaifu denied he had merely yielded to U.S. pressure.
   He said a decline in the trade imbalance from a peak of $59.8
billion in 1987 to $49 billion last year was the result of both
countries' efforts. He also defended Bush's pledges to cut the $155
billion U.S. federal budget deficit.
   ``The United States is committed to resolve its problems, and we
must also follow through with our reforms and continue our
cooperative dialogue with them,'' said Kaifu, who returned late
Sunday from the weekend summit.
   He faced skepticism, however, over his ability to follow through
on promises to Bush that he will reform Japan's distribution system
and land use policies, improve living standards and tighten
enforcement of anti-monopoly laws.
   In talks called the ``Structural Impediments Initiative,'' U.S.
officials have said these reforms are needed to eliminate what they
call informal trade barriers.
   The nation's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, said Bush's
requests to Kaifu would ``severely test Kaifu's leadership
ability.'' Another major paper, the Asahi, said the challenge would
test the entire Japanese leadership.
   ``The Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative will end in
empty talk unless Japanese companies' overly strong competitiveness
and the nature of Japan's closed economy are subjected to close
scrutiny,'' the Asahi said in an editorial.
   In Palm Springs, Bush also said he wanted to help cut the trade
imbalance by reducing the U.S. federal budget deficit, improving
education and worker training, increasing savings and investment,
and encouraging long-term management strategies aimed at boosting
industrial productivity.
   Japan is under pressure to show it will implement promised
reforms before early April, when trade negotiators are to issue an
interim report on the structural trade talks.
   Japanese officials expressed concern Kaifu will have problems
gathering support for reforms soon enough to satisfy the United
States. Kaifu lacks political clout within his own party and faces
an upper house of Parliament dominated by the Socialist-led
opposition.

   Moslem militants ambushed a government
patrol in the heart of Srinagar while curfew was lifted briefly
today, and one civilian was killed when the troops returned fire, a
senior officer said.
   The militants claimed they killed 12 members of the Border
Security Force, but a senior officer of the paramilitary force said
only two of his men were wounded and none were killed.
   The officer said the ambush in Srinagar was one of the boldest
and best organized ever carried out in the Kashmir city, center of
the pro-independence movement by Moslems who want to secede from
predominantly Hindu India.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attackers fired Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles from three directions,
using at least 100 rounds of ammunition.
   The attack occurred on the main shopping street in the heart of
Srinagar. The curfew, which had been in effect since Friday
morning, was lifted for the first time for a few hours early today
to enable thousands of stranded villagers to return home.
   The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying it was to avenge the killing of 49 Moslem
demonstrators by army and paramilitary troops last Thursday.
   ``We have killed 12 Indian soldiers. We carried out the
operation this morning to take revenge for the deaths of our Moslem
brothers who were killed by the army,'' a telephone caller told a
local journalist.
   The Border Security Force officer said one civilian was killed
and a suspected militant was seriously wounded when the ambushed
troops returned fire.
   About 150,000 people _ many of whom had participated in a
massive anti-India demonstration on Thursday _ were stranded by the
curfew, the intelligence officers said on condition of anonymity.
   An estimated one million people streamed through Srinagar
Thursday to demand Kashmir's independence from predominantly Hindu
India. It was the largest pro-independence demonstration ever
staged in the Kashmir Valley.
   The government said its troops opened fire in self-defense.
Witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the
marchers had tried to grab the weapons of soldiers and paramilitary
police.
   The killings by government troops prompted rebukes from
neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic nation, and appeals for restraint
from the U.S. State Department.
   Gov. Jagmohan, a federally appointed Hindu who is the top
administrator of Jammu-Kashmir state, met army and security
officials during the weekend and was to receive a delegation of
federal officials from New Delhi today, sources said.
   Jagmohan, who uses only one name, said in an interview Sunday
the government was prepared to call new state elections within six
months. But this seemed unlikely to appease the Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front and other militant groups who say they will be
satisfied by nothing less than independence.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
The southern Jammu region of the state is mostly Hindu, while the
Kashmir region that includes Srinagar is predominantly Moslem.
   Spurred in part by the Hindu ruler of the old princely state of
Kashmir, the valley acceded to India rather than join Pakistan. The
two countries went to war in 1949 and 1965 over Kashmir, but the
region still remains divided by a cease-fire line separating Indian
and Pakistani troops.
   Kashmiri secessionists initially sought to join Pakistan, but in
the past year the militants have been pressing for full
independence.
   Jammu-Kashmir's population of 6 million is 64 percent Moslem and
32 percent Hindu with small minorities of Buddhists, Sikhs and
Christians. Nationwide, Hindus account for 82 percent of India's
880 million people, while Moslems comprise 12 percent.

   To the cheers of hundreds of
onlookers, workers succeeded in lifting Bucharest's imposing statue
of Lenin from its foundation today after a weekend of intensive
demolition work.
   ``He was built to last a thousand years, but luckily he couldn't
withstand us,'' said Duri Gomfedele, a member of the crew that
finally brought down the 25-foot, seven-ton bronze statue.
   Workers labored all day Saturday and Sunday with jackhammers and
blowtorches to bring down the statue, located in front of the
Stalinist-style state publishing house in the recently renamed Free
Press Square.
   This morning, the statue was lifted from its marble base, placed
on a flatbed truck and driven away to a storeroom in Fondul
Plastic, the city's plastic art foundation, workers said.
   ``I can't believe it's finally happened,'' said Mihai Radulescu.
``I've been here every day since Saturday, waiting to see Lenin go.
This morning I didn't go to work.''
   Demolition crews had been slowed by the thick bronze rods
implanting the statue deep in its foundation. A small wrecking ball
that slammed against Lenin's arm Saturday failed to do more than
shake the statue slightly.
   ``To our surprise, there was a bronze plate ... protecting the
concrete foundation that also went up through his legs,'' said
Gomfedele. ``It was much more difficult than we expected.''
   The ruling Provisional Council of National Unity, acting as a
mini-parliament until national elections scheduled for May 20,
decided on Friday to remove the 30-year-old image of Lenin.
   The statue had become a symbol of the 45 years of Communist rule
that ended in December with the ouster of dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu by a popular revolt. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were
executed on Christmas day after a summary trial.
   The demolition provided weekend entertainment for hundreds of
Bucharest residents who monitored the job and joked about the
statue's resilience.
   Authorities said Saturday they had not decided what to do with
the statue, which depicts Lenin holding his cap and the lapel of
his overcoat. From where he stood, he stared down a broad avenue
towards Bucharest's Arch of Triumph.
   The now empty pink marble base is covered with anti-Communist
graffitti and blue writing that reads, ``Down with the Statue.''

<HEAD>East German Prime Minister in Moscow for Kremlin Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow arrived
today in Moscow for talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
expected to focus on prospects for future trade and security after
the March 18 East German elections.
   The Tass news agency said Modrow was met at the airport by
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly
Adamishin.
   Before Modrow's departure from East Berlin, the East German news
agency ADN suggested Gorbachev was concerned about Moscow's future
military and economic ties with a unified Germany. East Germany has
been the Soviets' chief trading partner and firmest defense ally.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised Gorbachev during a
meeting in Moscow Feb. 10 that the Soviet Union wouldn't lose vital
supplies as East Germany moves towards unification.
   The Kremlin is at odds with West Germany and its allies over
Western demands that a single Germany should remain in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Gorbachev is insisting on neutrality
for a unified Germany.
   Another key topic likely to be on the agenda will be Kohl's
refusal to give Poland a binding promise that a united Germany
would respect Poland's current frontier with East Germany.
   Poland gained territory from Germany after World War II, but
also lost large regions to the Soviet Union.
   Poland has requested the two Germanys to begin work on a treaty
that would guarantee the Oder and Neisse rivers as the permanent
border between Germany and Poland.
   Modrow supports Poland on the issue. The East German Foreign
Ministry has declared that all neighboring countries should be
represented at an international summit, where the two Germanys will
plot the course for unification with the World War II victors:
Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   East Germans go to the polls March 18. The Communists, running
under the new party name Party for Democratic Socialism, are a
distant third in the campaign for 400 parliamentary seats to be
distributed by East Germany's first competitive election in its
40-year history.
   The Communists are intent on preventing what they see as 40
years of accomplishments in East Germany from being wiped out in a
hasty merger with their Western neighbor.

<TEXT>
   Francois Truffaut's 1981 film ``The Last Metro''
was named France's best movie of the 1980s today by the 2,500 film
professionals who also pick winners of the annual Cesar awards, the
French Oscars.
   In ceremonies Sunday, ``Too Beautiful for You,'' the story of a
salesman who drops his beautiful wife for a passionate affair with
his dumpy secretary, won five Cesars, including best film, best
director and best screenplay.
   ``The Last Metro'' starred Gerard Depardieu and Catherine
Deneuve as an actor and a theater owner. It takes place in World
War II during the German occupation of Paris, when a strict curfew
made it essential to catch the last subway train home.
   Depardieu was chosen best actor of the decade. The award for
best actress went to Isabelle Adjani for her performances in such
films as ``Camille Claudel.''
   The 1980s ``Super Cesars'' were announced in a statement the day
after Sunday's awards, at which actor Kirk Douglas was master of
ceremonies.
   Bertrand Blier won best director for ``Too Beautiful for You,''
and Carole Bouquet, who played the wife, was named best actress.
Among those she edged out was Josiane Balasko, who put on weight to
play the fat and apparently ordinary temporary secretary who wins
the heart of the car salesman, played by Depardieu.
   Depardieu was nominated for best actor, but the award went to
Philippe Noiret for his portrayal of a French army officer in the
aftermath of World War I in ``Life and Nothing Else.''
   The fifth award for ``Too Beautiful For You'' went to Claudine
Merlin for best editing.
   Best foreign film was ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' by the British
director Stephen Frears, an adaptation of the 18th century French
epistolary novel, ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' by Choderos de
Laclos.
   A French-made film adapted from the same novel, ``Valmont,'' won
the award for best costumes. Its director, Milos Forman, was
nominated for best director.
   Before the ceremonies, Culture Minister Jack Lang made Douglas
an officer in France's Legion d'Honneur.

<HEAD>Appeal by Cleveland Company Rejected in Case Steeming from Hostage
Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from the
1981 settlement of the Iran hostage crisis, today rejected an
appeal by a Cleveland, Ohio, company seeking to avoid paying $3.6
million to Iran.
   The court, without comment, let stand what was described as a
first-of-its-kind ruling that American courts have authority to
enforce such payments.
   The agreement between the United States and Iran that freed 52
American hostages in 1981 included release by the U.S. government
of billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets.
   The settlement also set up a process permitting those with
claims against Iran to take them to an international tribunal.
   The Supreme Court previously upheld the power of former
President Carter to approve the settlement.
   At issue in the appeal acted on today was whether U.S. courts
can force American companies to pay claims the international
tribunal has awarded to Iran.
   Gould Inc., a high technology firm, was ordered by the
international tribunal to pay $3.6 million and return military
radio equipment to Iran.
   Iranian officials asked U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois
Jr. in California to enforce the tribunal's decision.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that U.S.
courts have such power, although the appeals court said the
authority does not derive directly from the 1981 settlement.
   The appeals court said the settlement was designed to secure
payment of claims against Iran and provided ``no specific vehicle
for the enforcement of awards in favor of Iran.''
   Instead, the appeals court relied on a 1958 United Nations pact
called the New York Convention. It provides for enforcement of
international arbitration awards.
   ``Party-states to the convention agree to recognize arbitral
awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with their own
rules of procedure,'' the appeals court said, noting that the
United States signed the pact in 1970.
   The $3.6 million payment order against Gould qualifies as such
an arbitral award, the appeals court said as it sent the case back
to Gadbois for further review.
   Gould acquired Hoffman Export Corp. in 1978. The Hoffman company
sold electronic military equipment to Iran when it was a U.S. ally
ruled by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
   The case is Gould Inc. vs. Iran, 89-1103.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal From Western Pilots in Suit Against Delta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by 661 pilots who say their seniority rights were violated
after Delta Air Lines acquired Western Air Lines.
   The court, without comment, let die the pilots' lawsuit against
Delta and the Air Line Pilots Association.
   The pilots, most of whom had worked for Western and now are
employed by Delta, said Delta reneged on a promise to arbitrate
labor disputes arising from the 1986 merger of the two airlines.
   The former Western pilots also accused the Air Line Pilots
Association of failing to represent them adequately.
   They said Delta used illegal coercion to enforce new seniority
rankings, threatening to lay off more than 300 pilots if the
rankings were rejected.
   As a result, the pilots said they occupy just 95 of the top 600
positions instead of the 189 they are entitled to by seniority.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a
California judge's dismissal of their lawsuit.
   ``The integration of a seniority list involves much more than
listing pilots according to the date that each began work,'' the
appeals court said. ``It encompasses such variables as the pilot's
rank and the kind of aircraft with which a pilot has had
experience.''
   The appeals court said the post-merger agreement between Delta
and the pilots union was acceptable to most of the union members,
although it was opposed by most of the former Western pilots.
   ``Only the collective bargaining representatives _ or the
carrier _ may submit a dispute over the integration of seniority
lists to arbitration,'' the appeals court said.
   That rule is designed to allow a union ``to focus on the needs
of its whole membership without undue fear of lawsuits from
individual members,'' the 9th Circuit court added.
   The case is Herring vs. Delta Air Lines, 89-1119.

<TEXT>
   Hank Gathers, one of college basketball's
premier players, collapsed and died after sinking a slam dunk
during a game. He was 23.
   The cause of the Loyola Marymount University star's death Sunday
night was not immediately known, but he had fainted during a game
in December because of an irregular heartbeat and had been taking
medication for the condition, doctors said.
   An autopsy was planned but not before Tuesday, said an official
in the Los Angeles County coroner's office who refused to identify
himself.
   The 6-foot-7, 210-pound senior center from Philadelphia was
expected to be a first-round choice in this year's National
Basketball Association draft. He was known for his intensity and
his will to win.
   ``If there can be any good in this, at least he died doing the
thing he loved best,'' said his high school coach, Rich Yankowitz.
   Yankowitz, who coaches at Dobbins Technical High School, said he
talked with Gathers three weeks ago, and the player said he felt
good and looked forward to the rest of the season.
   ``He was pleased with the way everything was going. He seemed
real happy, again focused properly on what was important to him.
Everything was fine,'' Yankowitz said.
   Gathers averaged 28.8 points and 11.2 rebounds a game this year.
During his junior year, he averaged 32.7 points and 13.7 rebounds,
and his 1,015 points last season ranked him 11th on the all-time
single-season scoring list.
   Gathers had dunked the ball during the first half of a West
Coast Conference tournament game against Portland and headed
upcourt with a big smile.
   Seconds later, without warning, he crumpled to the court. He
tried to rise but got only to his knees before collapsing again. He
appeared to suffer convulsions for a few seconds while his mother
and aunt raced to his side.
   Their cries could be heard throughout Gersten Pavillion as the
crowd of about 3,000 sat in stunned silence.
   Efforts to resuscitate Gathers on the court, in an ambulance and
at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital failed. He was pronounced dead
less than two hours after he collapsed.
   ``I thought the chances (to save him) were good,'' cardiologist
Dr. Mason Weiss said. ``We were unable to generate any activity.''
   The game and tournament were canceled and Loyola, which was
leading Portland 25-13, was declared the league champion by virtue
of its 13-1 record in conference games. The team planned to meet
today to decide whether to accept a bid to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament.
   ``Words are hard right now,'' Loyola coach Paul Westhead said in
a statement. ``This is the hardest thing I've experienced ... to be
so close to a player and see him fall and for it to be over. I feel
a deep hurt for his family.''
   Gathers had collapsed Dec. 9 because of what doctors suspected
was an accelerated heartbeat. He was hospitalized several days for
tests, returned after missing two games and began taking medication
to regulate his heartbeat, doctors said.
   Yankowitz said he had spoken to Gathers' doctors and college
coach and had been told that he would be fine. ``That's what makes
it so alarming; he was playing with the doctor's blessing,'' he
said.
   Jerome ``Pooh'' Richardson of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves
said Gathers recently told him that doctors had allowed him to
lower his dosage of medication because it was making him drowsy.
   ``He said he felt great. He was in good spirits,'' said
Richardson, who played against Gathers in high school. He said
Gathers had planned to watch the Timberwolves play the Los Angeles
Lakers after Loyola's game Sunday.
   After Gathers' death, ``This game means absolutely nothing,''
Richardson said.
   Two of Gathers' closest friends from Philadelphia, La Salle
University players Lionel Simmons and Doug Overton, began sobbing
when they learned of the death during a game Sunday night in
Albany, N.Y.
   ``We're going back to the hotel and we're going to talk about
it,'' La Salle coach Speedy Morris said later. ``They're having a
cry right now. Their feelings and emotions are pouring out. It's
very difficult to talk to them right now.''

<HEAD>Congressman Challenges Sections of ``Born on Fourth of July''
Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Dornan is challenging the
accuracy of ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' saying the hit movie
could mislead viewers about the record of author Ron Kovic, who may
be his election opponent.
   The Republican congressman said he was attacking the movie
because it could leave people in his district with the impression
that all of the events actually happened to Kovic, whose wounds in
Vietnam left him paralyzed from the waist down.
   The movie recounts Kovic's transformation from patriotic Marine
to war opponent.
   ``The movie is in effect his political resume. And Kovic has
engaged in resume padding,'' Dornan said recently.
   Sid Galanty, Kovic's media representative, dismissed Dornan's
remarks.
   ``It's an entertainment vehicle, not a documentary,'' said
Gallanty, who did not dispute the discrepancies brought out by
Dornan. ``People who want a strictly factual account should read
the book.''
   Kovic, 43, whose autobiography was made into the Tom Cruise film
directed by Oliver Stone, has been wooed by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Kovic has not said if he will run against Dornan, but said his
``time of dedicated service to my country has come again.''
   In February, Dornan sent out 20,000 fund-raising letters that
called Kovic the favorite of the ``ultra-liberal ... Hollywood
left.''
   Among the inaccuracies cited by Dornan and backed by others were:
   _Kovic is shown accidentally killing a fellow Marine during
combat, then later going to the dead Marine's parents to tell them
of the incident.
   Marine Lt. Col. Fred Peck, responding to media inquiries, said
Kovic's commanding officer concluded that Kovic did not shoot the
Marine. Kovic told KNBC-TV that the scene of the visit to the man's
family did not actually happen, but was a recurring nightmare that
he had.
   _Kovic is shown being attacked with other students by
nightstick-wielding riot police in 1970 at Syracuse University
after a speech by the late activist Abbie Hoffman.
   New York state Sen. Nancy Hoffman and Washington attorney David
Ifshin, who both participated in the protest, say Abbie Hoffman was
never on the campus.
   ``The movie is totally inconsistent with the facts,'' said Ms.
Hoffman, adding that police ``displayed remarkable restraint.''
   _Kovic also is shown being spat on and roughed up by security
guards at the 1972 GOP national convention in Miami. But former CBS
correspondent Roger Mudd, who was near the scene of the alleged
action, doesn't remember it that way. Mudd also denies Kovic's
account in his autobiography that Mudd interviewed the activist
during the incident.

<HEAD>Palestinian Leaders Insist PLO Be Involved in Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian leaders from the occupied
territories demanded today that the PLO be involved in proposed
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a move Israel has consistently
opposed.
   The statement, signed by more than 30 prominent Palestinians
from the occupied lands, was released as Israeli leaders were
deadlocked over accepting U.S.-backed compromises aimed at getting
preliminary peace talks under way.
   The hardened stance by the Palestinian leaders lessens the
chances of Israel accepting the compromises, which were aimed
partly at avoiding even the appearance of PLO involvement.
   Israel's right-wing Likud bloc, headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, has resisted proposals by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to include residents of Arab east Jerusalem and two
Palestinians deported by Israel among the negotiators.
   Party hard-liners fear such a move would allow indirect
participation by the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist
organization.
   The statement by 34 Palestinian leaders from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip was circulated in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
   It called for ``the immediate opening, without pre-conditions,
of a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue'' and chided the Israeli
government for ``placing obstacles in the way of any effort to move
the peace process forward.''
   But it also repeated the Palestinian demand that the PLO
represent them in the talks.
   ``The PLO alone has the right both to form and to announce any
Palestinian delegation to the peace dialogue,'' the statement said.
``No Palestinian from the Israeli-occupied territories will
participate in any delegation that is not formed or announced by
the PLO.''
   The U.S. compromises for getting talks started reportedly
specify that Egypt will announce the makeup of the Palestinian
delegation.
   Asked about the statement, Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner
reiterated the government's position on the PLO, saying that,
``anything that is connected to the PLO is disqualified by us. We
won't agree to the PLO participating in any way, directly or
indirectly, in the talks.''
   Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, said they were not concerned
their statement might deepen the rift between the Likud bloc and
its partner in the coaltion Cabinet, the left-leaning Labor Party,
which supports the U.S.-backed compromises.
   ``We do not care about the dispute between Labor and Likud,''
said Jamil Tarifi, a pro-PLO lawyer from the West Bank town of
Ramallah who signed the statement.
   Another signer, Saeeb Erakat, a political science professor from
the West Bank city of Jericho, said the statement was issued
because ``there are a lot of rumors and confusion created by Israel
insisting Israel will have a say in the delegation.''
   ``We are not a herd of sheep. We have a leadership. Israel knows
it, but pretends it doesn't know,''he said.
   The statement also called for ``an open agenda'' for the talks
and said they should lead eventually to an international peace
conference.
   Israel has repeatedly said it wants the agenda focused on
Israel's call for elections in the territories. The elections plan,
put forward in May 1989, would select Palestinians to hold talks
with Israel on limited autonomy for the territories.
   The statement called for continued pressure on Israel to accept
PLO participation in negotiations, including continuation of the
nearly 27-month uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
lands. In the uprising, which began in December 1987, at least 659
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians and
43 Israelis have died.

   The leader in the Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race hit the highest point in the 1,160-mile competition today
on the third day of the wilderness trek, but others were slowed by
volcanic ash.
   Four-time champion Rick Swenson reached a 3,500-foot pass in the
towering Alaska Range after holding back Sunday at Skwentna during
the warmest part of the day while others went ahead, sparing his
dogs and waiting for the trail to freeze. Temperatures have risen
into the 30s.
   Three-time winner Susan Butcher of Manley continued to move up
the pack, having hit 11th place after starting the race in
Anchorage as No. 68 of 70 mushers.
   A quarter-inch of gritty volcanic ash from Sunday's eruption of
Redoubt Volcano was reported on the trail at Finger Lake, slowing
the sleds, said race spokeswoman Theresa Daily.
   The race across Alaska from Anchorage to Nome, on the Bering Sea
coast, has been run since 1973.
   It was founded to commemorate the delivery by sled dog relay
team of diphtheria serum to Nome in 1925. The serum staved off an
epidemic.

<TEXT>
   Medical records confirmed today that a
former president of Brandeis Univesity and his wife were among four
Americans killed in last week's fire at a luxury hotel, a U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman said.
   Also today, a tourism official said the fire safety procedures
of all Cairo hotels will be reviewed.
   Seventeen people were killed in the hotel fire early Thursday at
the Heliopolis Sheraton, which started in a garden tent restaurant.
   Among the victims were Prof. Marver Bernstein, 71, a former
president of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. and his wife,
Sheva Rosenthal.
   Spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba of the U.S. Embassy said the couple's
dental and medical documents arrived today, providing positive
identification.
   Bernstein was dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs at Princeton University before becoming
president of Brandeis in 1972.
   In 1983 he joined Georgetown University's School of Foreign
Service, where he taught both politics and philosophy and
coordinated the school's American courses program.
   He retired last year but remained as a lecturer.
   Bernstein was born in Mankato, Minn.. He married Rosenthal, a
native of St. Paul, Minn., in 1943, the Washington Post said.
   Also today, officials said security systems at Cairo's hotels
and firefighting equipment would be reviewed. Hamdy el-Shamy of the
Tourism Ministry said there would be ``coordination to organize
regular checks.''
   He said most of Egypt's luxury hotels had tents similar to the
one that caught fire at the Sheraton and that they were legal.
Officials have charged that the Sheraton set up the tent illegally.
   Survivors of the Sheraton fire have said there was no sprinkler
system or fire alarm, but Sheraton officials have insisted an alarm
was sounded when the fire spread from the tent restaurant to the
hotel.
   Scores of brightly colored canvas tents decorate many of the
country's major hotels to create a Middle Eastern flavor in
nightclubs and restaurants. They are popular with Egyptians and
foreigners.
   About 2.4 million tourists visited Egypt in 1989, bringing in
$2.4 billion in revenue.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS lead to specify that court's ruling concerned right
to legal help; Inserts graf 5, The court, with background.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that even when
police question criminal defendants in violation of their right to
legal help, the responses may be used to contradict trial testimony
by the defendants.
   By a 5-4 vote in a Michigan case, the court said the
Constitution does not bar use of such statements when they are used
by prosecutors to rebut a defendant's testimony and impeach the
accused person's credibility.
   ``The prosecution must not be allowed to build its case against
a criminal defendant with evidence acquired in contravention of
constitutional guarantees,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
wrote for the court.
   ``But use of statements so obtained for impeachment purposes is
a different matter,'' he said. ``If a defendant exercises his right
to testify on his own behalf, he assumes a reciprocal obligation to
speak truthfully and accurately.''
   The court previously has ruled that statements obtained by
police in violation of a defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination may be used to challenge the defendant's
trial testimony. Today, the court extended those rulings to allow
use of statements obtained in violation of a defendant's Sixth
Amendment right to legal representation.
   The court ordered further lower court hearings that could lead
to reinstatment of Tyris Lemont Harvey's criminal sexual conduct
conviction and 6-to-10-year prison sentence.
   Harvey was accused of sexually assaulting a woman on June 11,
1986.
   Two months after his arrest and after he was assigned a
court-appointed lawyer, Harvey was questioned unlawfully by police.
The police told Harvey he did not need to speak to his lawyer first
because the attorney ``was going to get a copy of the statement
anyway.''
   The statement was used at the trial when prosecutors
cross-examined Harvey to challenge his testimony on the witness
stand.
   Harvey testified the woman agreed to remove her clothes
voluntarily and said the two did not engage in sexual intercourse.
The woman said she was forced to engage in sexual acts.
   Harvey's conviction was overturned by a Michigan appeals court
which ordered a new trial. The state court said any statements to
police as the result of an unlawful interrogation may not be used
for any purpose at the trial.
   Rehnquist said the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution,
guaranteeing legal representation to defendants, does not prohibit
use of Harvey's statement to police as long as it was made
voluntarily.
   ``We have never prevented (all) use by the prosecution of
relevant voluntary statements by a defendant,'' Rehnquist said.
``The search for truth in a criminal case outweighs the speculative
possibility that exclusion of evidence might deter future
violations of rules'' by the police.
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``The
tragedy of today's decision is not merely its denigration of the
constitutional right at stake. It also undermines the principle
that those who are entrusted with the power of government have the
same duty to respect and obey the law as the ordinary citizen.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and Harry A. Blackmun.
   The case is Michigan vs. Harvey, 88-512.

   Two house fires in Alabama killed six
people early today, including three children whose father suffered
burns while trying to reach them in their burning Albertville home.
   The others were a woman and two men who died of asphyxiation
after fire broke out in their home at Dothan.
   Authorities in Albertville, about 60 miles northeast of
Birmingham, identified the victims as Brandy Leigh Michael, 12,
Terry Lynn Michael, 8, and Jeremy Daniel Michael, 4.
   Albertville Fire Marshal Guy Campbell said the father, Larry
Daniel Michael, 31, escaped through a window and was burned when he
went back into the home trying to save the children. He was taken
to University Hospital in Birmingham for treatment of second- and
third-degree burns.
   Campbell said the cause of the blaze, which was reported at 1:52
a.m., was not immediately determined.
   The fire in Dothan, which occurred at about 3 a.m., was blamed
on either cigarette smoking or an electric heater. The three
victims were identified as Mildred B. Cook, 70; Johnny Lee Ward,
68, and Ward's son, Irvin Price, 51.
   Dothan is in southeast Alabama, 105 miles from Montgomery.

<HEAD>Lawyers Protest Human Rights Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 500 lawyers walked off their
jobs and sat on the lawns in front of the Supreme Court building
Monday to protest what they called human rights violations by the
government.
   The hour-long demonstration, organized by the Nepal Bar
Association, brought work in the court to a standstill, court
officials said.
   Bystanders and visitors to the court were held back from the
site of the demonstration by riot police.
   Lawyers say 59 of their colleagues were arrested in the
government's crackdown on a movement for greater democracy. Several
have been released and one alleged police tortured those detained.
   ``For five days I had to sleep on damp floors, with only rotten
food to eat. Even drinking water was not available,'' said Asik Ram
Karki.
   He said some of those arrested were beaten on the soles of their
feet.
   A nationwide movement was launched Feb. 18 by the Nepali
Congress Party and the Communist Party of Nepal demanding the
restoration of multiparty democracy and an end to a 1961 royal
decree banning all political parties.
   According to the government, 12 people have been killed in
demonstrations and police firing since then, but activists say the
toll is double that figure.
   Nepal's 2-year-old experiment with Western-style democracy ended
in 1961 when King Mahendra, father of the present monarch, King
Birendra, dissovled the government of the Nepali Congrees Party,
accusing it of corruption and poor administration.
   The government accuses the multiparty advocates of trying to
impose their version of democracy on a nation that they say already
has a working deomcracy.
   Power in Nepal is shared between the king and the non-partisan
Rashtriya Panchayat, or national assembly. One-fifth of the
Panchayat's 140 members are nominated by the king; the rest are
elected.
   The government of King Birendra says the campaign to lift the
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum which
narrowly voted for retaining the Panchayat's system of non-partisan
membership.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Conviction of Death-Row Inmate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today used the case of a
South Carolina death row inmate to limit the ability of criminal
defendants to challenge their convictions in federal court.
   The court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld the conviction of Horace
Butler, sentenced to die for the 1980 murder of Pamela Lane.
   The court refused to apply retroactively a 1988 ruling that bars
police from questioning a suspect about any crime once the suspect
has invoked his right to have a lawyer present.
   The body of Ms. Lane, an 18-year-old clerk at a convenience
store near Charleston, was discovered near a bridge July 17, 1980.
   Butler was arrested six weeks later on assault and battery
charges unrelated to the woman's death.
   He obtained a lawyer's representation after refusing to talk to
police without an attorney present. Sometime later, police
questioned him about Ms. Lane's death and Butler confessed he shot
her.
   Butler asked a federal judge to throw out his conviction on
grounds that, under the Supreme Court's 1988 ruling, his rights
were violated by unlawful police questionning.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
it was too late for the 1988 ruling to be of any help to Butler.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
decision _ by refusing to apply new court rulings to previous
criminal cases _ ``strips state prisoners of virtually any
meaningful federal review of the constitutionality of their
incarceration.''
   He was joined in dissent by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The case is Butler vs. McKellar, 88-6677.

<HEAD>Negotiators Unhappy With Progress in U.S.-Japan Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. trade negotiators told Congress today
that they have been disappointed with the lack of progress so far
in efforts to reduce Japanese barriers to American imports.
   But the negotiators held out hope that the weekend summit
between President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
may re-energize the stalled talks.
   Two senators warned of growing congressional unhappiness with
the seemingly intractable $49 billion trade deficit America is
running with the Japanese. They raised the possibility of
legislation that would force the administration to retaliate
against Japanese products sold in this country.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative S. Linn Williams told a Senate
trade subcommittee that in the three rounds of talks held so far
little progress has been made. He said the Japanese negotiators
have raised a number of reasons for being unable to make the
reforms sought by the American side.
   ``We are not satisfied with the progress of the talks,''
Williams said. ``The basic question is whether the Japanese side
sees (the negotiations) as damage-control and a public relations
exercise or as a substantive effort. On that, the jury is still
out.''
   Williams appeared with officials from State, Treasury, Commerce
and the Council of Economic Advisers to give a progress report on
the so-called structural impediments initiative, which aims at
eliminating economic shortcomings in both countries viewed as
culprits in the massive trade imbalance.
   On the Japanese side, negotiators are focusing on various
exclusionary business practices that keep out foreign competition.
The American issues include a low savings rate and high federal
budget deficit, which increases the need for foreign capital to
finance the U.S. savings shortfall.
   The negotiators, who face a deadline of April for an interim
report and July for a final report, have achieved no breakthroughs
so far.
   Trade held center stage at a two-day summit between Bush and
Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif., over the weekend. The administration
officials today said they were encouraged by the pledges both
leaders made after the discussions concerning the need to make
progress.
   However, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the trade
subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Kaifu's
promises of reforms made to Bush were not enough.
   ``Every U.S. president since Nixon has gotten promises of a more
open market from Japan. Most of those promises have been empty,''
he said.
   Baucus and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., both said that Congress'
patience was growing short and if the talks failed it was likely
that Japan would face legislation requiring mandatory legislation.
   ``The next few months are going to be telling months for Japan
and for the Bush administration,'' Danforth said.

<TEXT>
   Seven women were sent into a pool of potential
jurors today for the Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter,
including a lawyer who worked in George Bush's presidential
campaign.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene disqualified one of
eight prospective jurors as the jury selection process got under
way for the trial of the former national security adviser.
   One of those questioned by Greene and lawyers for both sides was
a real estate lawyer who worked in Bush's campaign on a team that
did background reviews of potential vice presidential candidates.
The woman said one of Poindexter's defense lawyers, Joseph Small,
had babysat for her when she was a child.
   ``Just because counsel babysat for her doesn't cast any doubt on
her,'' said Greene, who sent her into the pool.
   Richard Beckler, one of Poindexter's lawyers, started off the
questioning by asking the first prospective juror what she thought
of Reagan.
   The young woman, an unemployed delivery driver for an auto parts
firm, wasn't given a chance to answer. Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan
Webb objected to Beckler's question, without giving a reason, and
U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene sustained the objection.
   A pool of 206 potential jurors was set up for the Poindexter
trial and 50 of them were in the U.S. courthouse for the first day
of questioning. Seventy-six of the 206 prospective jurors said in
questionnaires filled out last week that they had seen, read or
listened to portions of Poindexter's immunized testimony to
Congress in 1987, according to Greene.
   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, obstructing Congress and
making false statements for allegedly covering up Oliver North's
secret Contra resupply network and lying about a 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Theformer president gave videotaped testimony last month in the
case and Poindexter's lawyers are expected to replay it in court.
Reagan said he instructed his staff that all efforts to assist the
Nicaraguan Contras ``should be done within the law.''
   Reagan said he didn't think Poindexter had made any false
statements to Congress and that ``I'm in complete support'' of
letters by Poindexter which form the basis of one of the
obstruction charges against him concerning the Contras.
   Poindexter is the highest-ranking Reagan administration official
to go on trial in the scandal. U.S. District Judge Harold Greene is
presiding in the Poindexter case and a jury of 12 people will be
selected from a pool of residents from the District of Columbia.
   Directing the prosecution is Chicago trial lawyer and former
U.S. attorney Dan Webb, while Poindexter is being defended by
longtime Washington D.C. attorney Richard Beckler.
   The Iran-Contra affair began unfolding in October 1986, when an
ammunition-laden C-123 that was part of North's operation was shot
down inside Nicaragua. North later testified under a grant of
immunity that he began shredding documents after the cargo plane
was shot down.
   The next month there were news reports from Beirut of U.S. arms
sales to Iran. North later testified that then-CIA Director William
Casey advised him to destroy evidence relating to the initiative.
   The Contra and Iran parts were linked on Nov. 25, 1986, when
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III announced that Iran arms sale
money had been diverted to the Contras.
   The indictment against Poindexter deals with his alleged
assertions to Congress on Nov. 21, 1986, that he didn't find out
that Hawk missiles had been shipped to Iran in November 1985 until
two months after the delivery.
   Poindexter ha said his recollection of the Hawk shipment was
``very, very fuzzy'' in November 1986 and that while he may have
made incorrect statements, he did not lie to Congress.
   National Security Council computer messages support North's
testimony last year that he kept Poindexter advised of the November
1985 shipment both before and immediately after it occurred, but
Poindexter said he forgot.
   ``My best recollection is ... that I did not remember anything
about, or know anything about the Hawks until January '86,''
Poindexter told congressional investigators in immunized testimony
in 1987.

<HEAD>Andy Rooney's Return Boosts ``60 Minutes'' Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Viewer curiosity over Andy Rooney's return to
``60 Minutes'' after a shortened suspension helped the CBS show
trounce its competition in preliminary ratings, a CBS research
official said Monday.
   With Rooney back at work, commenting on his suspension, Sunday's
``60 Minutes'' got a 36 per cent share of the audience and a 22.7
rating in the A.C. Nielsen Co. overnight audience estimates. Those
estimates are from 23 cities that collectively represent 45.3 per
cent of the nation's TV households. The show's share usually
averages 32 or 33 percent in overnight ratings.
   ABC's ``Life Goes On'' averaged a 15 per cent audience share and
a 9.6 rating. NBC's Walt Disney movie series was third, averaging a
14 per cent audience share and an 8.5 rating.
   National ratings are due Tuesday.
   Athough still top-rated, ``60 Minutes'' had begun falling in the
ratings since Rooney's three-month suspension, on Feb. 8.
   On Feb. 25, the show slipped to 18th place in the weekly
Nielsens. But research analysts at all three networks said that
primarily was due to ABC's competition that night, a rerun of the
one-hour premiere of its hit ``America's Funniest Home Videos''
series.
   The ABC special, in the time slot normally held by ``Life Goes
On,'' beat ``60 Minutes'' in the ratings.
   Rooney was suspended without pay after a homosexual-oriented
magazine quoted him as making disparaging racial remarks. Rooney
denied the remarks attributed to him.
   He had drawn fire earlier from gay-rights groups for a December
special on CBS in which he cited ``homosexual unions'' as among the
causes of premature deaths.
   On Thursday, CBS News president David Burke, who never
specifically said why he suspended Rooney, ordered an early lifting
of the suspension, allowing the 71-year-old commentator to return
to work.
   ``Obviously, the return of Andy Rooney had a lot of people
tuning in,'' said CBS research vice president Michael Eisenberg.
``People were curious about the whole matter, and we probably
picked up people who don't normally watch `60 Minutes.'''
   Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' averaged a 33 per cent share of the
audience in New York, and a 39 per cent share in Los Angeles. Those
cities are the nation's first and second largest TV markets in size
of audience.
   In San Francisco, which has a large homosexual population, the
program averaged a 41 per cent share of the audience, according to
Eisenberg.

   A teen-ager snubbed by youths playing basketball at
a schoolyard returned with a shotgun and sprayed the group with two
blasts of birdshot, wounding 10, police said Monday.
   The group, which included two junior-varsity players from Edison
High School, was playing Sunday outside an elementary school when a
stranger asked to play but was told he couldn't, witnesses told
police.
   The teen-ager left, but soon returned, riding in the passenger
seat of a small van. The van slowed as it passed within 20 feet of
the court and the teen-ager fired a shotgun twice into the group,
the witnesses said.
   Police were looking for the youth but had little to go on, said
spokesman David Rivero.
   ``It's shocking,'' said Dorothy Jackson, grandmother of one of
the wounded players. ``Where can these boys go now if they want to
stay out of trouble? They can't even go to the school.''
   None of the injuries were serious. All 10 were released after
hospital treatment.

<HEAD>Union Leader Defends Stamp Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the union representing mail
carriers came to the defense of higher postage rates Monday, a day
before the Postal Service was expected to announce plans to raise
the price of a stamp.
   ``A stamp today, in terms of real dollars, is cheaper than it
was in 1971,'' said Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National
Association of Letter Carriers.
   The U.S. Postal Service has scheduled a Tuesday news conference,
at which it is expected to announce plans for a rate increase
affecting all classes of mail.
   The new rates would take effect sometime in 1991, probably
including a 30-cent price for first-class stamps. Currently, the
first-class rate is a quarter.
   It cost 8 cents to mail a first-class letter when the current
postal service was set up in 1971. Adjusting for inflation since
then, the cost should of a stamp now should be just what it is, 25
cents, Sombrotto said.
   But, he added, in 1971 the postal service received several
million dollars in tax subsidies that have been eliminated. If that
value were included, stamps should be selling for 33 cents today,
Sombrotto said.
   Sombrotto said he anticipated that a planned rate increase will
renew discussions of turning the postal service over to private
business, or allowing private companies to compete in mail delivery.
   ``It would be an absolute disaster'' if that were to happen, he
said.
   The postal system is designed to provide service to everyone in
the country at the same price, he said, contending that private
companies could choose to serve only profitable urban areas,
leaving the costly rural deliveries to the postal service. That
would mean either higher costs for rural residents or taxpayer
subsidies, Sombrotto said.

   A man was rescued from a cramped, wet
cave Monday 16 hours after he fell 30 feet from a ledge and
suffered lacerations and broken ribs.
   More than 75 rescuers worked through the night to extricate
Aaron Howell, 20, from the cave on private property about five
miles west of Bloomington.
   Howell, of Franklin, and two friends entered the cave Sunday
morning. He slipped off the ledge about three hours later.
   Jeff Schepper, one of Howell's spelunking partners, said Howell
fell about 30 feet and was unconscious for about 10 minutes.
Schepper went for help but it took him about two hours to find his
way out of the cave.
   Paramedics and cave rescue workers found Howell conscious and
coherent about 1,300 feet inside the cave Sunday night but had to
use hand chisels and mallets to clear a path to him at the base of
the ledge.
   ``It was all hand labor; they didn't take any specialized tools
in,'' said Capt. Paul Spicer with the Van Buren Township Fire
Department.
   ``It's very low,'' Paquette said. ``It's rocky. We have deep
pools of water. There's a lot of obstacles they have to get
through,'' said Don Paquette of Bloomington Grotto, a cave
exploration group.
   Paramedic Jeff Rogers, who spent about six hours with Howell in
the cave, said Howell was uncomfortable but in good spirits
throughout the rescue. The temperature in the cave was estimated at
about 53 degrees.
   Howell was finally removed from the cave about dawn Monday.
   He was listed as stable at Bloomington Hospital with multiple
lacerations and rib fractures. Hospital spokeswoman Beth Maxwell
said he also suffered hypothermia and dehydration.

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a hill overlooking the center of
Vilnius, three tall, white crosses stand in simple defiance to
history.
   Hidden by locals to prevent destruction by the Soviets in the
late 1940s, the stone crosses were brought out again last year and
given their former place of prominence.
   The crosses are emblematic of the city of about 400,000 people
that is surrounded by low wooded bluffs and bisected by the
green-gray ribbon of the Nera River: Vilnius has learned to survive
foreign conquest and re-emerge with its essential character intact.
   Today, as electric trolleys whoosh along its stone-paved streets
past colorful kiosks and centuries-old churches, Vilnius presents
an attractive face in contrast to the gray monotony of other Soviet
cities.
   As the capital of Lithuania, the Baltic republic incorporated
into the Soviet Union in 1940 and now struggling to restore its
sovereignty, Vilnius finds itself at the center of a peaceful
rebellion against Soviet control.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party officially broke ranks with
Moscow in December and multiparty elections on Feb. 24 brought to
office what will be the Soviet Union's first
non-Communist-dominated parliament. Its first duty will be to lead
Lithuania back to full independence.
   Despite the momentous changes, the city seems curiously calm and
rancorless, as though it would not be wise to get too excited just
yet.
   On the spring-like day last month when the voting took place,
townspeople lounged in Lenin Square, reading books or chatting with
their grandchildren.
   At the center of the park stands the 30-foot-tall statue of
Lenin, but his oratorical posture seemed out of place with the
relaxed mood around him.
   If Lithuania follows the rest of Eastern Europe, the Lenin
statue may not be standing much longer and the Communist Party will
find itself on the sidelines.
   ``The situation is not yet ripe for the Communists to leave, but
in the long run, yes, they will go,'' said Kastas Kumstys, a
student sharing a park bench with his girlfriend.
   They had voted earlier in the day for a professor from the
Sajudis independence movement, but Kumstys said he had no illusions
the situation would quickly improve.
   ``My parents had Stalinism and now we have a time of everything
overturning,'' he said. ``I don't think it will be better soon.''
   What most people talk about is not the elections, but the
terrible state of the shops.
   On otherwise elegant Gedimino Street, where a huge placard
proclaims ``A Lithuania without sovereignty is a Lithuania without
a future,'' scores of Saturday shoppers lined up for small green
oranges being unloaded from moldy boxes marked ``Cuba.''
   Elsewhere in the market, barriers kept people back while workers
filled a stand with grapefruit. When the barriers were removed,
shoppers raced to the stand, elbowing aside each other as they
greedily grabbed for the citrus.
   At a music store up the street, the only records being offered
for sale were Comecon music: LPs from Czechoslovakia, Cuba,
Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.
   ``The kind of music I like, they don't have here,'' said a
20-year-old disgruntled shopper walking out the door.
   The young man spoke in Russian-accented Polish, one of the three
languages of Vilnius.
   Lithuanian is spoken most, followed by Russian. But many
residents are ethnically Polish and retain the language that
dominated the city _ then known as Wilno _ when it was part of
Poland from 1920 to 1939.
   Poland and Lithuania were united from 1386 to 1795 and its upper
classes remained Polish into modern times.
   Marshal Jozef Pilsudski so loved his home town that he conquered
it for newly restored Poland in one of the small wars that followed
the collapse of the Russian empire in World War I.
   The nascent state of Lithuania was forced to set up its capital
in Kaunas, 60 miles away, a fact Lithuanians have neither forgotten
nor forgiven.
   After Poland fell in the early days of World War II and the
Soviets annexed Lithuania, Vilnius was made capital of the
Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic _ one of the 15 republics
making up the U.S.S.R.
   A year later, the Nazis swept in. During a brutal occupation,
they killed nearly all of the city's Jews. The partisan Polish Home
Army drove out the Germans in 1944, but then came Soviet commissars
who arrested the Poles in turn.
   After the war, Vilnius' damaged old town was lovingly repaired,
including the 400-year-old Vilnius University, where the Polish
faculty was deported to Poland and replaced by Russian professors.
   At Ostra Brama (The Pointed Gate), in the last remaining segment
of the old city wall, Polish pilgrims come again to pray before the
painting of Our Lady of Ostra Brama, which used to rank with Our
Lady of Czestochowa as the most revered of Polish icons.
   A synagogue also remains and bakeries still sell round rings
very much like bagels in addition to brick-like loaves of black
bread, a local specialty.
   The mixture of cultures is what gives Vilnius its special charm,
says a Lithuanian-speaking resident of Russian, Polish and Jewish
descent who asked that her name not be used.
   ``Vilnius was always so,'' she said. ``It has always been a
crossing of nations. There were four nations living here: Poles,
Lithuanians, Russians and Jews. They lived here peacefully. ...
Because of this Vilnius has this open, tolerant character.''

   Costa Rica's ambassador called on fugitive
rancher John Hull on Monday to return to Costa Rica to face trial
on charges ranging from aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to
alleged involvement in a terrorist bombing.
   Ambassador Danilio Hernandez stood up in the middle of a news
confernece called by friends of Hull to declare: ``He should be
tried by the courts of Costa Rica, not by the press or by his
friends.''
   ``Mr. Hull is a (naturalized) Costa Rican citizen and therefore
he is subject to Costa Rican law,'' Hernandez said. ``He has been
accused; the investigation has been carried out.''
   Hull, 70, had been scheduled to appear at the news conference to
discuss plans to sue people he contends fabricated the evidence on
which the Costa Rican charges are based.
   Associates said Hull was seriously ill and recovering from
recent heart surgery in Indiana, his home state.
   Gus Breene, who identified himself as a former test pilot who
has investigated charges against Hull, said the suit would seek
several million dollars in damages and would be filed within the
next few weeks in a federal court.
   He would not name either the likely defendants or Hull's lawyers.
   Hernandez said a request for Hull's extradition to Costa Rica is
moving through that nation's legal system, but indicated it might
be months before it is ready to be filed.
   The ambassador denied accusations Hull has made that he was
denied medical attention for more than 50 hours after his arrest.
   ``That is not true,'' Hernandez said.
   Hull, in comments read by Breene, denied the charges against him
and contended they were based on perjured statements.
   Breene said Hull has told him he intends to return to Costa Rica
and face the charges ``as soon as his health is repaired.''
   Among other charges, Costa Rica wants Hull to stand trial for
allegedly planning the bombing of a news conference being held in a
house in La Penca, Costa Rica, on May 31, 1984, by Eden Pastora, a
Contra commander who had defected from the Sandinista cause.
   An Amercan reporter, two Costa Rican journalists and a a
Nicaraguan rebel were killed. Pastora and about a dozen other
people were injured.
   ``We're going to prove all of this is made up,'' said Hull's
18-year-old son, John Jr.

   A judge today reluctantly agreed to a month's
delay in the trial of four young white men accused of killing a
black teen-ager. The prosecution had sought the delay to find a
missing witness.
   Judge Thaddeus Owens had first ruled that jury selection should
begin today as scheduled. ``If you can't move the case, that's your
problem,'' he told the prosecution.
   But he changed his mind less than an hour later after
prosecutors insisted they were not ready to proceed.
   ``I have no choice,'' Owens conceded. ``The law is clear on
that.''
   He set a new trial date of April 2, a date which he said was
``written in stone.''
   Prosecutors announced last week that an important witness was
missing and said that if he were not found by today they would seek
an adjournment.
   The four defendants are among seven young white men who are
charged in the slaying of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, who was
surrounded and killed Aug. 23 after he ventured into the
predominantly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to look at a
used car.
  Zistrict Attorney Charles J. Hynes had said the disappearance of
John S. Vento would not ruin the rosecution's case. ``Obviously,
you want as many building blocks as possible, but without him we'll
be able to proceed to trial,'' he said earlier.
   Privately, though, prosecutors said the setback was a severe
blow, and defense lawyers _ who had pressed for an immediate start
of the trial _ maintained the disappearance would seriously affect
the prosecution's case.
   A second blow to the case came when it was revealed several days
ago that another key prosecution witness, Gina Feliciano, a woman
who has been under police protection since the attack, has entered
a drug rehabilitation center.
   The judge was expected to empanel two juries to simp,waneously
hear testimony against two sets of defendants.
   Lawyers on both sides said Vento, 21, has admitted participating
in the attack and maintains he saw a gun passEdXto the man accused
of fatally shooting Hawkins in the chest.
   Vento was given a deal to testify; if he fails to surrender in
the next few weeks, Hynes said he will void the plea bargain and
charge Vento with murder.
   Authorities have described the killing as a racial attack
sparked by a dispute between one of the defendants and accused
ringleader, Keith Mondello, 20, and Miss Feliciano, a former
girlfriend.
   As word spread through the mainly white neighborhood on the
evening of the slaying that Miss Feliciano had invited black and
Hispanic friends to her 18th bcrshday party, Mondello allegedly
recruited several friends to take on what they saw as intruders.
   Police said the whites mistook Hawkins and his three pals, all
black, for Miss Feliciano's guests and set upon them. As the gang
of up to 30 whites surrounded the young blacks, Joseph Fama, 19,
allegedly opened fire with a pistol.
   Hawkins collapsed on the sidewalk and died as members of the mob
fled.
   Fama and five others have been charged with murder; a seventh
defendant, Steven Curreri, 19, was charged with assault.
   The remaining three defEnants will be tried later.
   Miss Feliciano is considered a key witness by prosecutors who
planned to call her to the stand to establish a motive for the
attack and to identify gang members.

   A judge Monday dismissed a misdemeanor
prostitution charge against a man accused of killing 11 women.
   Arthur J. Shawcross was to be tried on a charge of patronizing a
prostitute. But the prosecution did not want to proceed with the
case because of the possibility that Barbara Mae Dodson, a key
witness, would invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify
about her alleged prostitution activities.
   The Monroe County district attorney's office also was concerned
about generating publicity before Shawcross' murder trial, Abate
said.
   Jeffrey Abate, an assistant district attorney, had asked that
the prostitution trial be postponed until after the murder trial,
but City Court Judge John Manning Regan had denied the request.
   Shawcross' attorney, David Murante, opposed the dismissal of the
charge, saying the trial would have been an opportunity to test
Dodson's testimony.
   Dodson gave police a statement on Jan. 3 detailing two alleged
encounters she had with Shawcross.
   Shawcross was arrested the next day on the prostitution charge,
and subsequent questioning led to his being charged in the
slayings, which occurred during the past two years.

   Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican
National Committee, fainted while speaking at a fund-raising
breakfast today and was rushed to a local hospital, a spokeswoman
said.
   Atwater recovered immediately after he collapsed at the podium,
said Leslie Goodman, RNC communications director.
   Atwater, just back from the West Coast where he accompanied
President Bush to several GOP fund-raisers, recently has been on a
special liquid diet. Ms. Goodman said, however, that Atwater was
not now on a diet and she did not believe it was a factor in his
collapse.
   Atwater is a frequent jogger.
   One aide said Atwater had been using a diet food sold in powder
form in grocery and drug stores and designed to be mixed with milk.
   The aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said however
that Atwater had lost little weight on the diet because he
frequently supplemented its milkshake-like regimen with regular
high-calorie foods.
   Ms. Goodman said Atwater was not a strict adherent of any diet.
   She said that he had encouraged ``everyone who wanted to'' at
the RNC to go on a voluntary diet. ``It was Lee's suggestion that
we be lean and mean for the 1990s, and that the only thing we were
going to lose this year was weight.''
   Atwater told a reporter last week that he was no longer using a
liquid diet supplement, and recentlty had gained several pounds.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Atwater told
the White House that he expected to be released soon from the
hospital.
   On the issue of a liquid diet, Fitzwater said: ``How can he be
on a diet? He only weighs 25 pounds.''
   Ms. Goodman said that Atwater, 39, had not been ill and that his
collapse was a ``total surprise.''
   He was being kept at George Washington Hospital for tests.
   Atwater was attending a fund-raising breakfast for Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel.
   ``He was in the middle of a speech,'' Ms. Goodman said.
   She said that a doctor at the event ``immediately attended to
him'' and that an ambulance was quickly summoned.
   ``He is up and about at the hospital, but he is going to remain
there to undergo a series of tests,'' she said.
   ``We don't have any more information. He's coherent. He knows
what's going on,'' she added.

<HEAD>Mongolians Express Resentment of Decades of Soviet Domination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolians are showing resentment of
the generations of domination by Moscow that began when their
country followed the Soviet Union to communism in the early 1920s.
   Growing anti-Soviet feeling is expressed in many ways, from
heated exchanges between Mongolian journalists and Soviet diplomats
to a hissed ``Russkie!'' when a Mongolian driver mistook an
American for a Russian.
   Soviet influence has been strong since the founding of the
Mongolian People's Republic. When its two neighbors, China and the
Soviet Union, parted over ideology in the 1950s, Mongolia sided
with Moscow.
   A foreign reporter who had spent five years in the Soviet Union
described Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, as ``a typical Russian
town.''
   The Mongolian language is written in Cyrillic, the same script
as Russian. Nearly all educated Mongolians speak Russian and almost
all intellectuals studied in the Soviet Union, which has put a
great deal of money into the vast pastoral nation of only 2 million
people.
   Ulan Bator's debt to Moscow has been estimated by Western
economists at the equivlalent of nearly $6 billion.
   In recent years, Mongolians have begun emerging from the Soviet
shadow. Nationalism, which sometimes takes the form of
anti-Sovietism, is growingre usually
averages 32 percent or 33 percent in overnight ratings.
   ABC's ``Life Goes On'' averaged a 15 percent audience share and
a 9.6 rating. NBC's Walt Disney movie series was third, averaging a
14 percent audience share and an 8.5 rating.
   National ratings are due Tuesday.
   Athough still top-rated, ``60 Minutes'' had begun falling in the
ratings since Rooney's three-month suspension, on Feb. 8.
   On Feb. 25, the show slipped to 18th place in the weekly
Nielsens. But research analysts at all three networks said that
primarily was due to ABC's competition that night, a rerun of the
one-hour premiere of its hit ``America's Funniest Home Videos''
series.
   The ABC special, in the time slot normally held by ``Life Goes
On,'' beat ``60 Minutes'' in the ratings.
   Rooney was suspended without pay after a homosexual-oriented
magazine quoted him as making disparaging racial remarks. Rooney
denied the remarks attributed to him.
   He had drawn fire earlier from gay-rights groups for a December
special on CBS in which he cited ``homosexual unions'' as among the
causes of premature deaths.
   On Thursday, CBS News president David Burke, who never
specifically said why he suspended Rooney, ordered an early lifting
of the suspension, allowing the 71-year-old commentator to return
to work.
   ``Obviously, the return of Andy Rooney had a lot of people
tuning in,'' said CBS research vice president Michael Eisenberg.
``People were curious about the whole matter, and we probably
picked up people who don't normally watch `60 Minutes.'''
   Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' averaged a 33 percent share of the
audience in New York, and a 39 percent share in Los Angeles. Those
cities are the nation's first and second largest TV markets in size
of audience.
   In San Francisco, which has a large homosexual population, the
program averaged a 41 percent share of the audience, according to
Eisenberg.

<TEXT>
   A 309-year-old plantation has
reopened to tourists five months after Hurricane Hugo left $1.3
million in damage to the grounds and buildings.
   Hundreds of tourists and picnickers took advantage of Boone Hall
Plantation's free admission Sunday to visit the attraction in this
Charleston suburb. The plantation reopened Thursday to paying
customers, but the fee was waived Sunday to thank those who helped
in the rebuilding.
   ``We've done remarkably well to be this close to normal,''
office manager Jean West said. ``People have been wonderful about
helping out. That's just one of the reasons for having a day like
today _ to say thank you to the people who have been so kind.''
   The plantation, a frequent filming site for Civil War movies,
suffered an estimated $1.3 million in damage in the Sept. 21
hurricane.
   Nearly every building lost its roof, and all 300 acres of the
plantation's timber and 80 percent of its commercial pecan grove
were destroyed. In addition, its commercial cattle operation was
halted because of the many downed fences on the estate.
   Plantation director William H. McRae said the commercial
operations will not be resumed.
   Since Boone Hall was a ``working plantation'' before the storm,
the closing of the pecan and cattle ventures will result in
long-term income loss, but McRae said he hopes to find new revenue
sources.
   The plantation was built in 1681 by Maj. John Boone, who was
granted the land from the Lords Proprietors of England. The
privately owned property has been open to the public since 1956 and
receives more than 100,000 visitors a year.

<TEXT>
   When the white government
established black homelands in the 1960s, it saw them as the
perfection of segregation and the ultimate answer to South Africa's
racial conflict.
   Now those homelands, long ignored and usually docile, are
turning on their creators. Some are becoming a force in the
struggle against apartheid, South Africa's official policy of
segregation by race.
   Military leaders who seized power Sunday in the Ciskei homeland
left no doubt of their loyalties: They were flanked at their first
news conference by officials of the African National Congress, the
main black group fighting white domination.
   The coup ousted President Lennox Sebe, 63, one of several
authoritarian leaders of homelands who have worked closely with
South African security forces and suppressed anti-apartheid
activists.
   Homeland leaders of Sebe's generation face increasing pressure
from restless young activists who see the homelands as an attempt
to restrict blacks to the most isolated and underdeveloped parts of
the country.
   South Africa spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to
support the homelands, which have little industry or arable land.
   Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo, 37, who led the Ciskei coup, said he
wants the homeland to relinquish its nominal independence and
return to South Africa.
   ``The homelands are falling apart, unable to contain the
accelerating rate of political change,'' the anti-apartheid
newspaper Weekly Mail said in an editorial.
   ``Rising expectations for reincorporation in South Africa and
long-running resentment against poverty have led to strikes,
demonstrations and political violence.''
   South Africa has 10 black homelands and has declared four of
them independent since 1976, including Siskei. Their independence
is not recognized abroad.
   About half of South Africa's 28 million blacks live in the
homelands, which are scattered across the eastern half of the
country and were established when Hendrik Verwoerd led South Africa
as prime minister in the 1960s.
   Verwoerd sought to make all blacks citizens of the homelands,
giving them local autonomy and leaving whites in control of the
national economy and government.
   The rule of older, conservative, tribal chiefs in the homelands
began to falter in 1987 when Gen. Bantu Holomisa, then 32, seized
power in Transkei.
   Holomisa made overtures to anti-apartheid groups and favors a
referendum on whether Transkei should relinquish independence and
return to South Africa.
   He recently helped organize a huge rally for Walter Sisulu and
other leaders of the African National Congress, which rejects the
homelands and praised Holomisa as an anti-apartheid ally.
   Leaders of the Lebowa and KwaNgane homelands also have expressed
support for the ANC.
   Since Holomisa began making changes in Transkei, rebellion has
increased in other homelands.
   Among recent developments:
   _ Dissident army officers in Bophuthatswana held President Lucas
Mangope hostage in February 1988 until the South African military
intervened and restored him to power.
   In the past month, unrest has has cost six lives and injured
dozens of people. Mangope rejects calls to return the territory to
South Africa, and declared: ``We will be an independent state 100
years from now.''
   _ Hudson Ntsanwisi, chief minister of Gazankulu, was not seen in
public for several days during recent violence in which at least 10
people were killed. Students, workers and bureaucrats have
conducted strikes or demonstrations in recent weeks.
   _ Civil servants have been striking in Venda and at least 18
people were reported killed, several in confrontations with
authorities.
   _ In KwaZulu, supporters of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the chief
minister, are involved in a 4-year-old power struggle with
anti-apartheid groups aligned with the ANC.
   Buthelezi sees the homelands as a step on the path to black
majority rule. He opposes apartheid, but parts with the ANC over
its support for guerrilla warfare, sanctions, boycotts and other
confrontational measures.
   South Africa sent security forces into Ciskei to stop looting,
but did not indicate Monday that it planned to restore Sebe, who
was accused of widespread corruption. The South Africans have not
tried to intervene on behalf of other homeland leaders threatened
by unrest.
   President F.W. de Klerk has not renounced any aspect of the
homeland system or taken a position on returning the areas to South
Africa. He has said, however, that the homelands will be welcome to
take part in negotiations on a new South African Constitution.

<HEAD>Court Upholds IRS Ruling Denying Tax Exempt Status to All-White
School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Tax Court has upheld an IRS order
denying a tax exemption to a South Carolina private school on
grounds it discriminates against blacks.
   ``The absence of either a single black student in the school or
a plausible explanation of inability to attract black students
permits an inference of discrimination, particularly in view of ...
(the school's) history,'' the court held.
   The decision, made public Monday, means that contributions to
Calhoun Academy in St. Matthews, S.C., are not deductible.
   Chief Judge Arthur L. Nims III held that although Calhoun had
adopted a racially non-discriminatory policy, the school had failed
to operate under that policy.
   ``We cannot conclude that non-discrimination in ... operations
is more likely than discrimination,'' Nims wrote for the court.
   Calhoun, organized as a not-for-profit corporation Dec. 30,
1969, offers classes for grades kindergarten through 12. The school
has never had a black pupil or teacher. Two black parents requested
and were given application forms for enrollment in 1984-85, but a
black teacher has never applied for employment.
   Since 1982, at least one pupil of Oriental background has been
enrolled in Calhoun. The only non-white teacher, a
Japanese-American, was hired in 1983, court records showed.
   The school amended its charter in 1985 and began advertising
that it did not discriminate. It applied to the Internal Revenue
Service for a tax exemption in 1986.
   The IRS denied the exemption, citing the fact that Calhoun was
formed at a time of enforced desegregation in area public schools,
its total lack of black pupils despite blacks being a majority in
Calhoun County and its failure to announce a policy of
non-discrimination until 1985.
   At a later meeting, the IRS suggested that Calhoun improve its
contacts with the black community and offer reduced tuition for
black pupils. A director of the school rejected the reduced-tuition
suggestion, saying it would result in unequal treatment on the
basis of race.
   In siding with the IRS, the Tax Court cited a 1983 case in which
the Supreme Court had stripped a tax exemption from Bob Jones
University after finding that it discriminated on the basis of race.
   The Supreme Court held that racially discriminatory schools
violate fundamental public policy and cannot be viewed as
conferring a benefit on the public.
   ``From the record before us,'' Nims wrote, ``it appears that
white students and their parents gravitate to petitioner (Calhoun)
at least in part because of a historical absence of black students:
Petitioner admits that the local public schools are superior in
material respects, yet considerably less expensive.
   ``Petitioner's survival would thus depend to some extent on
perpetuating its history,'' the court ruled, adding that such
discrimination would clearly preclude a federal tax exemption.

<HEAD>Sullivan Waves Caution Flag at Proposal to Expand Health Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said Monday
that a $66 billion plan to expand federal health care benefits
could backfire like last year's failed Medicare catastrophic
coverage program.
   ``Good intentions can have unintended consequences, particularly
if they carry a high price tag,'' Sullivan told the House Select
Committee on Aging.
   His comments were directed at recommendations last week by the
U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, known as
the Pepper Commission in honor of its first chairman, the late Rep.
Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   The commission _ made up of 12 members of Congress and three
White House appointees _ recommended a broad expansion of benefits
to the uninsured and those who need long-term care at home or in
nursing homes. The plan would cost the federal government $66
billion and private businesses $20 billion in increased
contributions to employee health plans.
   The commission did not specify how the government would pay for
the new benefits.
   Sullivan called the commission's recommendations ``one
contribution to the public debate over desirable health policy
goals'' but said the administration was awaiting reports from
several other panels that also are looking at health issues.
   Sullivan said he hoped the administration would have its own
recommendations by this fall.
   ``I want to be sure that as I go forward with recommendations to
the president that they are recommendations that will stand the
test of time,'' Sullivan said.
   ``We do not want another catastrophic outcome on our hands, and
my concern is that the $66 billion price tag on the Pepper
Commission's proposal could result in just that,'' he said.
   Congress last year repealed the Medicare catastrophic program,
which offered expanded health benefits to 33 million elderly and
disabled individuals, after some older Americans complained that
the benefits were too expensive and in many cases duplicated their
private insurance coverage.
   Noting that the Pepper Commission's recommendations on long-term
care were adopted on a divided vote, Sullivan said ``there clearly
is not yet a strong concensus for those programs.''
   He also expressed concern about the added costs to business
under Pepper Commission plan, saying the new requirements ``could
have very adverse effects on businesses as well as their employees
as well as on national competitiveness.''

<HEAD>More Than 360 Lebanese Detained in Europe with Forged Visas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 360 Lebanese fleeing their
war-battered country have been detained at Rome and Brussels
airports with forged visas to the Netherlands, aviation officials
in Beirut said Monday.
   More than 300 were being held at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
Airport and 60 at Brussels' Zaventem Airport after a Dutch
immigration officer ruled their visas fake, preventing them from
continuing to Amsterdam, the officials said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
detainees were mostly young men and their families who have lost
hope that Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war will end.
   The latest round broke out Jan. 30, with more than 750 people
killed and thousands wounded in the fight between renegade army
Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia under Samir Geagea
for control of the Christian enclave.
   Those held in Rome traveled during February from various Middle
Eastern points, including Beirut, the Syrian capital of Damascus
and the Cypriot town of Larnaca, the officials said.
   The Brussels detainees were stopped by police when they arrived
on a Middle East Airlines jetliner on Feb. 28 with fake visas to
the Netherlands, the Lebanese aviation officials said.
   Italian and Belgian authorities have reached no final verdict on
what to do with the detainees. A Belgian magistrate ruled he
airline should cover the expenses of the group in Brussels,
according to the officials.
   In Italy, the case prompted the authorities to impose a fine of
about $1,100 on any carrier for every passenger brought in with a
forged visa. The decision has not retroactive, the officials said.
   They said Belgium warned the airline in January for carrying 32
passengers bound for Stockholm, Sweden, via Belgium because they
asked for political asylum when they arrived in Brussels. Their
passports and visas were found to be fake and they remain under
arrest in Brussels, the officials added.
   Lebanese police have said racketeers have been tricking
thousands of desperate Lebanese into buying false visas at up to
$1,200 per visa.
   They said these rackets operated in Beirut's Moslem and
Christian sectors, as well as east Lebanon's Bekaa valley and the
main Palestinian base at the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp in the
southern port of Sidon.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DEATH PENALTY
   
   The court overturned a key portion of North Carolina's death
penalty law in a decision that might invalidate the sentences of
the state's 85 death row inmates.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices set aside a North Carolina
murderer's death sentence, reaffirming a decision that makes it
easier for capital case jurors to consider all ``mitigating
evidence.''
   The court also gave state prosecutors greater leeway in what
they tell juries choosing life or death for convicted murderers,
voting 5-4 in a separate case to uphold a California man's death
sentence.
   And in a third death-penalty ruling, the justices split 5-4 in
ruling that an Oklahoma murderer is procedurally barred from
contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore ``sympathy''
before it sentenced him to death.
   The cases are McKoy vs. North Carolina, 88-5909; Boyde vs.
California, 88-6613; and Saffle vs. Parks, 88-1264.
   
   CHALLENGES
   
   The court used the case of a South Carolina death row inmate to
limit the ability of criminal defendants to challenge their
convictions in federal court.
   The court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld the conviction of Horace
Butler, sentenced to die for the 1980 murder of Pamela Lane.
   The court refused to apply retroactively a 1988 ruling that bars
police from questioning a suspect about any crime once the suspect
has invoked his right to have a lawyer present.
   The case is Butler vs. McKellar, 88-6677.
   
   QUESTIONING
   
   The court ruled that even when police question criminal
defendants in violation of their right to legal help, the responses
may be used to contradict trial testimony by the defendants.
   By a 5-4 vote in a Michigan case, the court said the
Constitution does not bar the use of such statements when they are
used by prosecutors to rebut a defendant's testimony and impeach
the accused person's credibility.
   The case is Michigan vs. Harvey, 88-512.
   
   IRAN CLAIMS
   The court, ruling in a case stemming from the 1981 settlement of
the Iran hostage crisis, rejected an appeal by a Cleveland, Ohio,
company seeking to avoid paying $3.6 million to Iran.
   The court, without comment, let stand what was described as a
first-of-its-kind ruling that American courts have authority to
enforce such payments.
   The case is Gould Inc. vs. Iran, 89-1103.
   
   MIND-ALTERING DRUGS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether Louisiana officials wrongly
are giving a convicted murderer mind-altering drugs just so he can
be executed for his crime.
   The justices said they will study the case of Louisiana death
row inmate Michael Owen Perry, convicted of killing his parents and
three other relatives.
   The case is Perry vs. Louisiana, 89-5120.
   
   PILOTS
   
   The court refused to hear an appeal by 661 pilots who say their
seniority rights were violated after Delta Air Lines acquired
Western Air Lines.
   The court, without comment, let die the pilots' lawsuit against
Delta and the Air Line Pilots Association.
   The case is Herring vs. Delta Air Lines, 89-1119.
   
   KISMET
   
   The court refused to alter the fate of a 14-year-old copyright
dispute over songs from the play ``Kismet.''
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that awarded
about $1.2 million to the writers and copyright holders of the play
from MGM Inc.
   The case is MGM vs. Frank Music Corp., 89-1269.

   The Soviet legislature Monday directed two feuding
Caucasus republics to start negotiations toward settling the ethnic
conflict that has killed hundreds of people in two years of unrest.
   The Supreme Soviet returned to the emotional theme that has
added a constant undercurrent of tension to its deliberations on a
day during which a lack of a quorum frustrated efforts to take up a
law on property ownership, one of the key aspects of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic reforms.
   If approved, the law on property would break Soviet socialist
tenets by allowing private individuals to own means of production
and hire workers. A final draft presented Monday also dropped a
preamble that declared socialist property ``the foundation of the
social-economic system of the Soviet Union.''
   Instead of using the long-hated term of ``private property,''
the measure instead calls it the ``property of citizens.''
   Legislators approved a directive written on the dispute between
Armenia and Azerbaijan by its Presidium, or executive body, on a
vote of 298-20 with 45 abstentions after a debate punctuated by
pleas for reason and angry shouting by Armenian deputies.
   Supporters and opponents of the directive agreed it would not
solve the key problems of the region, but they differed on whether
it was a step forward.
   ``Every passionate speech is one more letter in a death sentence
for a living person,'' said deputy Nikolai Medvedev of Lithuania,
speaking in support of the directive.
   Armenian deputy Lyudmilla Arytyunyan told reporters all 14
Armenians present voted against it.
   Armenians say Azerbaijan has lost the moral right to rule the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh territory, and demand that it be taken
from Azerbaijan and placed under national jurisdiction, she said.
   Control of predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh is at the
center of the dispute between the two republics, but the directive
said nothing about Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Asked about Medvedev's plea, she said: ``I would like to ask,
`Is it better to live on your knees or die standing up?'''
   It gave the Interior Ministry, which controls the police, the
KGB and the two governments, two months to report back on who was
responsible for ethnic attacks on Armenians in Baku, Azerbaijan, in
mid-January that killed scores of people and led the Kremlin to
send in soldiers.
   An angry Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, who presided over
the session, told legislators it was a ``shame'' to show on the
daily delayed TV broadcast that they could not muster a quorum to
debate the property law.
   Some of the missing lawmakers were occupied by Sunday's election
to local and republic governing councils in Russia, the Ukraine and
Byelorussia, he said.
   Two-thirds of the 542 members of both houses of the Supreme
Soviet, or 361 members, must be present to pass legislation. On
Monday morning, 346 were present, and that swelled to 364 when
Lukyanov brought the 34-article bill up for an item-by-item vote.
   But then only 352 deputies voted on the first item, and Lukyanov
gave up further consideration of the bill until Tuesday.
   It was brought to the Supreme Soviet two weeks ago, just after
the Communist Party declared that individuals should be allowed to
own factories and other means of production. Legislators found it
too vague and sent it back for more committee work.
   The new draft strengthens provisions allowing individuals to
hire others, long prohibited by Soviet socialism as exploitation,
as long as they are provided adequate wages and benefits.
   Yuri Kalmykov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet committee on
legislation, told legislators the committees rejected a specific
mention of private property in the law because Soviets cannot agree
on what it means.

<HEAD>White House Doesn't Expect Imminent Release of Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Monday that there are no
grounds for expecting the imminent release of American hostages in
Lebanon, though ``there is a lot happening'' in behind-the-scenes
efforts.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said many people _
excluding U.S. government officials _ are involved in discussions
around the world on behalf of the hostages.
   The intermediaries include businessmen, diplomats of other
countries, representatives of the hostage families and their
employers and people who have contacts in Iran and Lebanon, he said.
   Often, they represent themselves as representing the United
States, ``but that is not the case,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Many of them have had contacts with the U.S. government,'' he
said. ``They have told us what they are doing, they have asked us
for advice.
   ``When all this comes out later, I don't want it said they were
working for the U.S. government. ... They've gotten advice and
comments and so forth, so there is a lot happening.
   ``I don't want to be discouraging,'' he said. ``I want to be
encouraging. We want as many people to be helping on this as
possible.''
   However, Fitzwater emphasized that the United States ``will make
no concessions in return for the hostages' release.''
   ``We cannot say that there is any movement,'' he said. ``We know
of no imminent release.''
   Fitzwater underscored that the United States is ready to talk
directly with Iran about the hostages ``whenever Iran is ready to
do so.''
   So far, he said, Iran has not shown any interest.
   Iran is believed to exert considerable influence over Hezbollah,
an umbrella group of Shiites believed to hold some of the Americans
in Lebanon.
   Fitzwater said that no U.S. government officials were speaking
with Iran about the hostages.
   Asked what the administration said to intermediaries who want to
work on the hostages' behalf, Fitzwater said: ``We give them our
policy and we say, `No deals. If you can be helpful, fine, but keep
in mind, this is our policy _ no deal.'''
   Fitzwater told reporters that if the United States becomes
involved in talks about the hostages: ``We'll try to keep you
informed of talks. I suspect they would be public, but you never
know.''
   Eighteen Westerners are being held in Lebanon. They include
eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Irishman and an Italian. Most are believed held by Shiite Moslem
factions loyal to Iran.
   The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Speculation about their release has been fueled by a spate of
stories about contacts in the Middle East about the hostages.
   For example, a Syrian source said Mahmoud Hashemi, a senior
Iranian envoy, met Sunday in Damascus with Farouk al-Sharaa,
Syria's foreign minister, ``to coordinate efforts between the
governments of Syria and Iran to gain the release of all the
hostages.''
   The source said Hashemi, the brother of Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, had arrived from Beirut, where he met with
senior Shiite Moslem figures on the hostage issue.
   Another source said: ``This appears to be a serious effort, the
first in some time, to end the hostage ordeal. ... But I don't
think we'll see anyone out tomorrow.''

   A prosecution witness against Joseph
Hazelwood clashed angrily today with a defense attorney who
suggested the witness had been coached to give opinions damaging to
the skipper of the Exxon Valdez.
   William Milwee Jr., an expert in salvaging grounded vessels,
shouted, ``They didn't tell me to say anything,'' as attorney
Michael Chalos attacked his testimony.
   Milwee has said that Hazelwood was reckless in his maneuvering
of the grounded tanker after it rammed a jagged reef. He has said
Hazelwood risked capsizing the ship by trying to run it off the
reef.
   Chalos produced a letter from prosecutors to Milwee which
suggested facts supporting those opinions. The letter was dated
before Milwee wrote his report in the case, but Milwee said he
formed his opinion independently.
   The interrogation came as the prosecution prepared to close its
case against Hazelwood. Defense lawyers were marshalling expert
witnesses to show the nation's worst oil spill was an accident, not
a crime.
   ``Any captain that was ever involved in a grounding or a
collision could be in the defendant's chair if a maritime accident
were a crime,'' said defense attorney Michael Chalos.
   Chalos, who said Hazelwood was feeling better after a bout with
the flu, said the defense planned to call about 10 witnesses. The
prosecution was expected to rest today or Tuesday.
   Defense witnesses will range from experts in matters of the sea
to ``fact witnesses'' who saw Hazelwood on the day his ship
grounded. They will seek to show that his actions do not support
felony and misdemeanor charges.
   ``These are not criminal acts,'' the lawyer said in an interview
Sunday. ``This is a maritime accident.''
   Chalos said an expert in computer simulations will show jurors
conclusively that the Exxon Valdez voyage would have ended safely
if crew members followed the skipper's orders for navigating
through a narrow passage into Prince William Sound.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was absent from the ship's
bridge when the 987-foot tanker went aground on jagged Bligh Reef
last March 24. The prosecution claims he was reckless and has
charged him with a felony, criminal mischief, and three
misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   He could receive up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The three issues which the prosecution has raised and which the
defense must address are Hazelwood's alleged intoxication, his
departure from the bridge 10 minutes before the accident and his
alleged recklessness in trying to move the tanker off the reef
after the grounding.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into
the clear waters of Prince William Sound, killing thousands of
birds, fish and other wildlife and coating hundreds of miles of
rocky shore with black goo.
   Chalos sees the alcohol issue as ``the keystone'' of the
prosecution's case and suggests there is no conclusive proof
Hazelwood was intoxicated. ``If they can't prove intoxication, it's
a very flimsy case,'' he said.
   An expert in alcohol toxicology was expected to be the
prosecution's climactic final witness, and the defense will answer
with its own expert, interpreting Hazelwood's blood alcohol reading
of .061 in a test 10{ hours after the grounding.
   Does this indicate alcohol consumed hours before the ship sailed
or possible drinking after the ship grounded? No one has said, and
not a single witness has described Hazelwood as appearing drunk.
   The charge of recklessness hinges on Hazelwood's actions after
the grounding.
   Prosecution witnesses have accused Hazelwood of recklessly
risking his ship and the lives of crew members by trying to run the
tanker off the reef. The defense insists he never tried to get off
the reef and said Exxon's salvage master will support that point in
testimony.
   But even if Hazelwood did try to move the tanker, the defense
says, it would never have budged. ``The prosecution's own experts
have said conclusively that it couldn't move,'' said defense
attorney Thomas Russo.
   To find Hazelwood guilty of recklnessness, Russo said, the jury
must believe there was a substantial risk the skipper ignored.
``There was no risk because it couldn't move,'' Russo said. ``If
you can't commit the crime, there is no crime.''
   Of course, only one witness can say exactly what the captain had
in mind on the fateful night, and that is the captain. Will he
testify?
   ``We haven't decided that yet,'' said Russo, ``and we won't
decide it until the very end.''

<HEAD>South Korea to Buy Soviet Enriched Uranium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday approved a
plan that would allow the state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp. to
import enriched uranium from the Soviet Union for nuclear power
plants, an official said.
   The decision cleared the way for South Korea and the Soviet
Union, which have no diplomatic relations, to begin cooperation in
nuclear power.
   The power company will import 40 tons of uranium each year for
10 years.
   Other details of the agreement have not been worked out yet, but
one power company official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said the price of the Soviet uranium would be set at
between $600 and $700 per ton, almost half of what the company is
paying now.
   In return, South Korea will make nearly 30 percent of its
payments to the Soviet Union in electronic consumer goods such as
televisions and computers.
   South Korea buys most of its uranium ore from Australia and
Canada and has it enriched in the United States and France. South
Korea pays $1,060 per ton for the enriched uranium, officials said.
   South Korea has nine nuclear power plants in operation and two
under construction. It plans to build three more by 1998.
   South Korea is the world's 10th largest producer of nuclear
energy and generates nearly 50 percent of its electricity in
nuclear power plants.
   Despite a lack of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union and
South Korea have expanded economic and cultural ties recently.
Trade between the nations totaled $700 million in 1989 and is
expected to rise to $1 billion this year.

   Most people won't recognize her name, but
Helen Stearns collaborated on several songs with her brother-in-law.
   The brother-in-law was Hoagy Carmichael, who composed such
legendary songs as ``Star Dust,'' ``Lazybones,'' and ``Georgia On
My Mind.'' He died in 1981.
   ``I loved to listen to him play,'' Stearns said. ``He'd be
sitting there pecking around on the piano and he'd come up with a
tune and say, `You're the writer. Give me some words.' So I did
sometimes. We wrote a lot of songs together, mostly children's
songs.''
   ``April In My Heart'' was one of their best.
   ``I didn't think much about it at the time, but I still get
small royalty checks for it from time to time,'' she said.
   Stearns, 82, was back in Carmichael's native state over the
weekend in conjunction with a retrospective concert by the Indiana
Symphony Orchestra.
   ``You know, there's something about Hoosiers that is
wholesome,'' she said. ``No matter where they go or what they do,
they carry it with them. That's what I remember about Hoagy. He was
always wholesome in that odd Hoosier way.
   ``That, I guess, and his music were what I liked most about
him.''
   Stearns was one of the ``Barclay Girls'' who modeled for artist
McLelland Barclay in the 1930s, wrote screenplays that included the
hit 1937 movie ``I Met Him In Paris,'' and later worked as a
newspaper editor in California and Maine, and as a writer, editor
and publisher of children's books.

   Jiang Xi Reng, best known for his portrayal
of the lord chamberlain in the 1986 film ``The Last Emperor,'' is
helping to organize a theater exchange program that was delayed by
China's political crackdown.
   The exchange between the Children's Theatre Company and the
Children's Art Theatre of Shanghai had been announced last spring.
   Jiang, a 30-year veteran of the Children's Art Theatre of
Shanghai, will play the wizard Gandalf in the Children's Theatre
Company's staging of ``The Hobbit.'' The production, directed by
CTC artistic director Jon Cranney, goes into rehearsal Tuesday for
an April 20 opening.
   In May 1991, Cranney and a team of designers stage the Theater
Company's version of ``The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins'' in
Shanghai.
   The Children's Art Theatre is the oldest children's theater
company in China. It was established in 1947 by Madame Soong Ching
Ling, wife of Sun Yat-sen, founder of modern China
   The exchange is an outgrowth of meetings that took place a year
ago between Cranney and Jin An Ge, his counterpart with the
Shanghai company. Plans were shelved, however, after the June
massacre in Beijing against advocates of democracy, and the two
artistic directors did not meet again until February.
   Plans for a joint production to tour China and Japan are
incomplete.
   Because relations between the U.S. and Chinese governments
remain strained, neither company has sought government assistance.

   The first black Miss USA says she's not a
``stereotypical all-American winner,'' and being raised by a single
parent on tough streets is a handicap that can be overcome.
   ``I had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don't have to
become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home,''
20-year-old Carole Gist told reporters Monday.
   Miss Gist, of Detroit, dreams of setting up a fine arts
institute for underprivileged children who, she says, are too often
taught to think ``the only way you can get ahead now is in sports.''
   She was chosen Friday from among 51 women competing for $200,000
in cash and prizes and the chance to represent the United States in
the 38th annual Miss Universe pageant in Hollywood on April 15.
   A junior in management and marketing at the Northwood Institute,
she said being black helped her ``stand out over all the blond,
blue-eyed women there.''
   But she said it was likely she was much different in other ways,
too.
   Raised by her mother, she moved often and sometimes lived in
rough neighborhoods.
   ``My home was broken into a lot,'' she said. ``When I was 5, I
remember seeing a burglar in my home and I was frightened to
death.''

after her second liver transplant.
   Doctors said the 12-year-old girl's condition was upgraded from
serious to fair Sunday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, received a new heart and
liver at Children's on Feb. 14, 1984, to control a condition in
which her cholesterol level was 10 times higher than normal.
   Doctors decided to implant a new liver Feb. 20 after Stormie's
first transplanted liver was damaged by hepatitis caused by an
unknown virus. Her donor heart was not affected by the disease.

   The religious affairs minister said Monday he
had asked for a ruling on whether the government could revoke the
citizenship of Arabs who petitioned the Soviet Union to halt the
flow of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   About 4,000 Israeli Arabs have signed a petition sponsored by

immigration is ``at the expense of the Palestinian people.''
   Thousands of immigrants are arriving in Israel each month
because of the Soviet Union's more liberal emigration policies.
   Zevulun Hammer, religious affairs minister and head of the
National Religious Party, told army radio such protests were ``a
blow to the heart of Israel,'' which was founded as a homeland for
Jews.
   He said he sent a letter Sunday asking the attorney general to
decide whether citizenship could be withheld from anyone ``who acts
against the right of Jews to return to the Land of Israel.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday
defended his demand that a guarantee of Poland's border be linked
to Warsaw's renunciation of war reparations, saying Poland has been
demanding compensation for forced laborers used in the Third Reich.
   In East Berlin, meanwhile, Communists and opposition parties
agreed to submit a broad social charter to lawmakers in both
Germanys designed to protect East Germans against social hardships
once the countries merge under a capitalist system.
   The charter, adopted at weekly negotiations between the
Communists and 15 opposition groups, demands that the right to work
and the right to accommodation be enshrined in the constitution of
a united Germany.
   It also calls for guarantees of democratic and humane working
conditions, education and health services for all, protection of
pensions, equality of the sexes, and social integration for the
disabled.
   Kohl's refusal to give Poland guarantees about its border has
led to a widening split with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, and the two met privately Monday to discuss the issue.
Results of the meeting were not made public.
   Genscher has been saying that West Germany must make clear to
its neighbors that a unified Germany would not be a threat.
   ``This not only concerns Poland's trust, but that of all
Europeans,'' he told the ZDF television network.
   Kohl has said he has no designs on land ceded to Poland after
the Third Reich's defeat _ about a third of modern-day Poland.
   But he has insisted that only the government of a united Germany
could have final say on the matter. Kohl faces West German
elections in December and is apparently concerned about losing the
conservative vote.
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has called on both
Germanys to begin negotiations on a treaty that would recognize the
Oder and Neisse rivers, which currently form the border, as the
permanent boundary between Poland and Germany.
   On Friday, Kohl said such a treaty would have to be tied to
Poland's 1953 renunciation of war reparations and of its pledge
last year to protect the ethnic rights of its German minority.
   Kohl's demands produced astonishment in Warsaw and harsh
criticism from politicians at home.
   The chancellor, trying to justify his demands, said Monday that
since 1987, Poland has been raising the topic of compensation for
Poles sent to Nazi labor camps during World War II.
   Kohl also said he would oppose signing a peace treaty as a means
of settling the border issue. No World War II peace treaty was ever
signed.
   In East Berlin, opposition minister Gerhard Poppe said the new
social charter, once adopted by the East German parliament, should
serve as the basis for East Germany's negotiations with its
capitalist neighbor on economic, monetary and social union.
   He said the charter also would be presented to the West German
Bundestag for discussion.
   According to the charter, unification should be based on
``reforming of both German social security systems, to perfect the
positive points of both.''
   Single parents, large families, pensioners and the disabled
should receive special advantages, the document said.
   Delegates also urged guarantees to protect East Germans'
personal property and savings.
   The proposed social charter comes less than two weeks before
East Germany's March 18 elections for a new parliament.
   East Germans traditionally have viewed their social security
network as the paramount achievement of more than 40 years of
Communist rule, and they are nervous about what might happen to
them under a capitalist system.
   Once efficient Western methods are introduced to East Germany's
state-controlled industry, for example, the now-negligible
unemployment rate in the country's 9 million-member work force
could jump to as much as 15 percent. Rent prices also are likely to
surge.
   East Germans in general know little about West Germany's social
security network, viewed as one of Western Europe's most generous.
   The conservative Alliance for Germany, backed by Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, appealed to voters not to fear the
switch to capitalism.
   East Germany's Christian Democratic Union chairman Lothar de
Maiziere said difficulties in the transition were a direct result
of years of Communist mismanagement.
   He pledged that the abolition of rent and food price subsidies
would be compensated by an increase in personal income.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of disabled demonstrated in Leipzig Monday
for the conversion of a Communist government hostel into a center
for the handicapped, the East German news agency ADN reported.
   The agency said the demonstrators, many in wheelchairs,
protested inadequate accommodation by waving banners that read
``Integration instead of isolation, rights not charity!''
   The hostel is the only building in the city built with
provisions for the disabled, ADN said.

<HEAD>Mayor Apologizes For Police Detention of Young Black in Fatal
Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACO, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor said Monday he plans to apologize
to the family of a young black man who was questioned in a
manslaughter investigation that has prompted comparisons to
Boston's infamous Stuart case.
   A white man has since been arrested.
   Although Mayor Mark Johnston said he would write a letter of
apology, he insisted that police in this southern Maine town did
nothing wrong and were not motivated by racism when they detained
19-year-old Jonathan Johnson as he returned home from school
Wednesday.
   ``They did exactly what they were supposed to do _ look for a
man fitting that description,'' Johnston said. It would be no
different, he said, ``if it had been a large fat man with a balding
head.''
   An NAACP leader agreed that authorities had acted properly.
   ``When I first heard about this, the first thing that came to
mind was the Stuart case,'' said Neville Knowles, president of the
Maine chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   ``But after sitting down and talking with the chief and the
deputy chief, it's my feeling that race didn't have anything to do
with the actions of the Saco Police Department.''
   In the Boston slaying of Carol Stuart, black men were randomly
questioned by police on the basis of a false report by the woman's
husband, who eventually was implicated in the killing and jumped to
his death off a bridge.
   Johnson was questioned about the shooting death of 21-year-old
Joseph Low after two of the white victim's roommates said a black
youth had fired the fatal shot. A third roommate, who is white, was
later arrested and charged with manslaughter.
   Detective Sgt. Michael Harriman said Johnson was detained for
about an hour and 45 minutes before being questioned for about five
minutes. He was then released.
   In the interim, police were interviewing two of Low's roommates,
Lisa Catroppo, 17, and Simon Langdon, 20, Harriman said. ``As we
continued the interview we came to realize that the story about the
black man was bogus,'' the detective said.
   The two roommates later admitted they had fabricated the story
and that no black man was involved, according to Harriman.
   Low's other roommate, 20-year-old Dana G. Harris, was later
arrested on a charge of manslaughter and was being held in lieu of
$25,000 cash bail, authorities said.
   Harriman said no charges have been filed against Catroppo and
Langdon in connection with their initial report to police. He said
the state attorney general's office was considering filing charges,
but Assistant Attorney General Pamela Ames said no criminal
prosecution was contemplated.
   Harriman said Johnson's mother had spoken to police when they
arrived at the apartment to question her son and was ``very
understanding'' about the situation.
   ``She could understand that her son happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time,'' Harriman said.

   Farmers often choose agriculture because
it offers independence and wide open spaces. But singles isolated
on the high plains and wind-swept prairies have found life on the
land is lonely without love.
   ``What surprises me is the number of people in the 30s, 40s and
50s who've never been married,'' said Marcy Gahm, president of
Singles in Agriculture. ``A lot stay on the farm with their
parents, and when mom and dad die, suddenly they're really alone.''
   Gahm said about 700 singles from around the country belong to
the organization, which she founded four years ago. They meet
regularly to share stories about their common bond.
   Many live and work on farms, especially in the Midwest; others
who now live in town trace their roots to agriculture.
   They gathered here in the heart of the Cornbelt from Thursday
through Sunday for the organization's fourth national convention.
   ``I started dating late in life and I live in an isolated area,
so there is no way to meet people,'' said farmer and winemaker
Jerome Hoelscher, 53, of Garden City, Texas.
   ``I was really uncomfortable when I attended the first meeting,
but now I feel so at ease with all these people, it's hard to
believe,'' said Hoelscher, who raises cotton, wheat and sorghum on
his 1,700-acre farm in west Texas.
   Members pay $20 to join and $15 to $30 for a listing in the
group's directory _ either by name or by confidential code.
   They meet at various places throughout the year _ camping in
Arkansas, square-dancing in Ohio, boating on the Mississippi River.
   Some make no bones about it _ they want to get married. Others
just enjoy being with people who understand them.
   ``I'm not interested in getting married, but I do like that
macho, outdoor-type man _ strong, healthy and down-to-earth.'' said
Nell Youngblood, a 62-year-old widow from Tulsa, Okla.
   Hoelscher said women with agricultural backgrounds understand
the oddities of farm life _ things that might put off a woman from
the city.
   ``The first thing they wouldn't understand is that you can't go
a short distance to the shopping center or supermarket,'' he said.
``They'd miss being surrounded by a lot of other people.''
   Farmers also have to work long hours, including Saturdays and
Sundays sometimes. And, he said, farm wives often share the chores.
   ``She might wind up doing work with her hands that's not so
attractive, getting dusty and cold,'' said Hoelscher. ``It's not a
sheltered life like the city.''
   It is a life that appeals to Debby Loveless of Mechanicsburg,
Ohio, a 36-year-old divorced mother of two.
   ``I'd like to live on the farm again, but I'm very particular
about men,'' she said. ``I haven't met anybody I want to spend the
rest of my life with.''

   The Artists Against AIDS fund-raising effort
came to Washington on Monday, le by Elizabeth Taylor and artist
Rubert Rauschenberg.
   The campaign is hoping to raise $1 million in Washington.
Earlier efforts in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco have
brought in $5 million so far, Miss Taylor said.
   ``The world is looking to the United States both to find a
medical solution ... and to find a compassionate and caring
response to those who are already afflicted,'' she said.
   ``Artists have to be the conscience of the country,'' said
Rauschenberg, who announced the donation of a painting to help
raise money. Rauschenberg has already donated art work worth
$500,000, said Patricia M. Kluge, a leader in the local effort.
   Special stage performances, a public art exhibition and a gala
fund-raiser are among the Washington events scheduled.
   Half of the money raised will go to the national research effort
and the rest to local organizations dealing with Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome victims in the Washington area, said Miss
Taylor.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today overturned a key
portion of North Carolina's death penalty law in a decision that
will invalidate the sentences of most of the state's death row
inmates.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices set aside a North Carolina
murderer's death sentence, reaffirming a decision that makes it
easier for capital case jurors to consider all ``mitigating
evidence.''
   ``The decision does not mean that any death row inmates will go
free, but it does mean that as many as 70 convicted murderers must
have new sentencing hearings,'' said North Carolina Attorney
General Lacy Thornburg. ``It means in each case that another jury
will be required to again decide the appropriate punishment.''
   It was not immediately clear why the decision would not affect
all 85 of the state's death row inmates.
   ``Essentially, the system that was condemned is the system we've
been using since 1977 for sentencing people to death,'' said
Raleigh lawyer Malcolm R. Hunter Jr., who represented the death row
inmate involved in today's decision.
   ``It could have a very broad impact,'' Hunter said.
   The court also gave state prosecutors greater leeway in what
they tell juries choosing life or death for convicted murderers,
voting 5-4 in a separate case to uphold a California man's death
sentence.
   And in a third death-penalty ruling, the justices split 5-4 in
ruling that an Oklahoma murderer is procedurally barred from
contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore ``sympathy''
before it sentenced him to death.
   The court's decision in the North Carolina case probably will
not affect any death row inmate outside the state, and the two
other rulings are not likely to affect many of the some 2,200 death
row inmates across the nation.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that even when police question criminal defendants in
violation of their right to legal help, the responses may be used
to contradict trial testimony by the defendants.
   By a 5-4 vote in a Michigan case, the court said the
Constitution does not bar the use of such statements when they are
used by prosecutors to rebut a defendant's testimony and impeach
the accused person's credibility.
   _ Ruling in a case stemming from the 1981 settlement of the Iran
hostage crisis, rejected an appeal by a Cleveland, Ohio, company
seeking to avoid paying $3.6 million to Iran.
   The court, without comment, let stand what was described as a
first-of-its-kind ruling that American courts have authority to
enforce such payments.
   _ Agreed to decide whether Louisiana officials wrongly are
giving a convicted murderer mind-altering drugs just so he can be
executed for his crime.
   The justices said they will study the case of Louisiana death
row inmate Michael Owen Perry, convicted of killing his parents and
three other relatives.
   The court's decision in the California death penalty case is a
defeat for Richard Boyde, who was convicted and sentenced to die
for the Jan. 15, 1981, murder of Dick Gibson, a Riverside, Calif.,
convenience store clerk.
   Police said Boyde, then 24, was accompanied by his 19-year-old
nephew, Carl Ellison, when abducting Gibson during a robbery that
netted $33 in cash. Gibson was taken to a nearby orange grove and
shot.
   Ellison also was convicted, and was sentenced to 25 years to
life in prison.
   Boyde had been convicted of robbing the same convenience store
five years earlier, and had been implicated in at least four other
convenience store robberies.
   The jury that sentenced Boyde was read a list of specific
mitigating factors it could consider in choosing his punishment.
Jurors also were told they could consider ``any other circumstance
which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a
legal excuse for the crime.''
   Boyde's lawyers argued that the instruction prevented jurors
from considering factors regarding his background and character
that might have been found to be mitigating even if they did not
lessen the gravity of the crime itself.
   The jury also was told it was required to impose a death
sentence if it found that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating
factors.
   Boyde's lawyers said the mandatory language prevented sentencing
jurors from considering his case a whole.
   The California Supreme Court decided by a 4-3 vote in 1988 that
Boyde had not been harmed by the challenged instructions.
   Neither instruction is still used in California, however.
   In upholding the state court ruling today, Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist wrote, ``There is not a reasonable likelihood that the
jurors in (Boyde's) case understood the challenged instructions to
preclude considerations of relevant mitigating evidence.''
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   In the North Carolina case, the court set aside the death
sentence of Dock McKoy Jr., convicted of the Dec. 22, 1984,
shooting death of Anson County Deputy Sheriff William Kress Horne.
   Prosecutors said Horne was one of several deputies who responded
to reports that McKoy was drunkenly shooting off his shotgun at his
home near Wadesboro, N.C.
   Relying on its 1988 ruling in a Maryland case the high court
said the jury that sentenced McKoy wrongly was limited in its
consideration of mitigating factors because jurors were told they
had to agree unanimously on the existence of each mitigating factor.
   ``North Carolina's unanimity requirement violates the
Constitution,'' Marshall wrote for the court.
   He was joined by Brennan, White, Blackmun and Stevens. Kennedy
wrote a separate opinion joining in the result. Rehnquist, Scalia
and O'Connor dissented.
   In the Oklahoma case, the court never reached the merits of
death row inmate Robyn Leroy Parks' challenge on an
``anti-sympathy'' instruction his sentencing jury received.
   Instead, Kennedy wrote for the court that Parks was procedurally
barred from raising that argument after having exhausted his direct
appeals in state courts.
   Kennedy was joined by Rehnquist, White, O'Connor and Scalia.
   Parks was convicted of the 1977 killin of Abdullah Ibrahim, a
gas station attendant in Oklahoma City.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 6-4 vote in 1988,
threw out Parks' death sentence after it upheld his murder
conviction. The appeals court said the instruction given to his
sentencing jury undermined its consideration of ``mitigating
evidence'' _ factors pointing to life in prison rather than death
as the appropriate punishment.
   The presiding judge had told jurors, ``You must avoid any
influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice or other
arbitrary factor when imposing sentence.''
   The justices in 1987 upheld a California murderer's death
sentence even though jurors in that case were told they should not
be swayed by ``mere sympathy.''
   The court said in the 1987 ruling that reasonable jurors would
understand that instruction ``as a directive to ignore only the
sort of sympathy that would be totally divorced from the
(mitigating) evidence.''
   Today, the court never answered whether the instruction given to
the jury in Parks' case is constitutional.
   ``The relief Parks seeks would necessitate the creation of a new
rule,'' Kennedy said, and such a decision generally cannot be made
in a case that is not on direct appeal.
   The cases are Boyde vs. California, 88-6613, McKoy vs. North
Carolina, 88-5909, and Saffle vs. Parks, 88-1264.

   A developer who has blamed much of his

PTL ministry filed personal and corporate bankruptcy reorganization
petitions Monday.
   Both Chapter 11 petitions say Roe Messner of suburban Andover
intends to propose a plan to reorganize his debts and continue in
business. The Chapter 11 provision of federal bankruptcy law allows
a debtor to forestall payments to creditors while coming up with a
plan to pay them.
   Messner and his wife, Ruth Ann, and their companies, Commercial
Builders of Kansas Inc., Messner Enterprises, Cloudridge Apartments
and Meadows Plaza Shopping Center, were included in the filings.
   A list of assets was not included.
   Unsecured debt amounts listed in the personal petition include
$750 million for a disputed court judgement in Greensboro, N.C.,
against Messner, Bakker and others; $8.7 million to a California
bank; $5 million to a South Carolina savings and loan; nearly $4
million to a Wichita bank; $1.3 million to a Wichita savings and
loan; and nearly $350,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.
   The Commercial Builders' petition listed debts totaling more
than $2 million owed to 20 companies.

<TEXT>
   Delegates opened an international
conference on education Monday urging action to fight illiteracy
and saying that the world can not develop with almost 1 billion
people unable to read.
   ``How can we hope to advance on the road to freedom and
democracy as long as one in three adults in the world remain
illiterate?'' said Frederico Mayor, head of the U.N. Scientific,
Educational and Cultural Organization.
   Mayor said that almost 100 million children in developing
countries have no access to basic education, and in some
impoverished nations 75 percent of the women are illiterate.
   But he said illiteracy also affects wealthy nations.
   ``Evidence ... suggests that between 10 and 20 percent of the
population of so-called advanced societies lack essential basic
skills of reading, writing, numeracy and problem solving,'' he said.
   Mayor was among the more than 1,200 government and
non-government representatives from 155 countries at the World
Conference On Education For All, the largest meeting ever held on
education. It was largely sponsored by the United Nations.
   His call to fight illiteracy was echoed in speeches by
Thailand's Princess Sirindhorn and Bangladesh's President Hussain
Muhamad Ershad.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De Cuellar sent a message to
the conference saying that he expected the meeting to ``spur
efforts towards drastically reducing illiteracy by the year 2000.''
   The United Nations has declared 1990 International Literacy Year.
   The conference was held in Jomtien, a beach resort about 68
miles southwest of Bangkok.
   The U.S. delegation was headed by Thomas H. Kean, the president
of Drew University and former governor of New Jersey.

<HEAD>Attorney: Espionage Probe Part of FBI Harassment Pattern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI's suspension of a Cuban-born agent in
connection with a reported spy probe is part of a pattern of
harassment against Hispanic agents, the man's lawyer charged Monday.
   Hispanic agents won a discrimination lawsuit against the bureau
two years ago.
   Special Agent Fernando E. Mata, a 15-year veteran stationed in
Miami who in 1983 received the Justice Department's top award for
his counterespionage, has been placed on administrative leave and
his security clearance has been revoked, said Antonio Silva, who
represents Mata in the bias case.
   ``The case against Mr. Mata is a house of cards,'' Silva said.
``There is no substance whatsoever to the allegations. It is
nothing more than reprisals and retaliation against him.''
   The investigation involves Mata's alleged contacts with Cuban
intelligence agents, The New York Times reported Monday, but Silva
said that under a federal court order he could not confirm that. He
did say that the FBI's case apparently relies on the disputed
results of lie detector tests.
   In Washington, the FBI issued a statement saying it would be
inappropriate to comment on the case.
   Mata's home telephone number is not listed.
   Silva, an El Paso, Texas, attorney who handled the 1988
discrimination case tried in that city, said the FBI initially
looked into accusations against Mata in 1987 but dropped that
investigation.
   Then, in August 1988, Mata testified in support of the lawsuit
brought by 311 Hispanic FBI agents who charged they were
discriminated against in hiring, promoting and disciplining. Silva
said the old investigation suddenly resurfaced.
   ``The timing on this is just outrageous,'' Silva said. ``It had
lain fallow for one year, and was resurrected two weeks after his
testimony.''
   The attorney said in the eyes of some superiors, Mata had
violated what agents call the First Commandment _ ``don't embarrass
the FBI.''
   There has been a series of retaliatory charges against agents
who testified in the lawsuit, he said, including three in San
Antonio, one in Philadelphia, and one in Los Angeles. Silva also
said there have been ``almost daily'' informal reports of other
kinds of harassment. Some of the cases have involved accusations as
serious as tipping off underworld figures or stealing confiscated
money, Silva said.
   ``The difference in Mr. Mata's case is that it's coming from the
upper levels of the FBI,'' Silva said.
   In November 1988, three months after appearing in court, Mata
filed an affidavit with the court complaining he had been put under
administrative inquiry for supposed security lapses during his
trial testimony.
   Silva, and Mata's other attorney in the case, Hugo Rodriguez,
also were investigated by the FBI _ a probe ordered halted by U.S.
District Judge Lucius Bunton, who presided over the bias case.
   In his trial testimony, Mata, 48, who has a law degree, said he
was told he could not be a legal adviser for the bureau in
Washington because of his dark skin and accent. He also said he was
ostracized by his colleagues in Miami because he participated in a
fund-raiser for the lawsuit.
   Bunton found the FBI had discriminated, and in May stripped FBI
supervisors of the power to overrule decisions by the bureau's
career promotion board.
   His order also set up a panel of three outside attorneys to
decide if up to 200 Hispanic agents should be promoted to make up
for past job discrimination.
   FBI Director William Sessions decided not to appeal the decision.

   Bob Hope was unable to attend a
charity event whose host was Jimmy Stewart, so he bought five
raffle tickets at $1,000 apiece to help out. He pulled the grand
prize, including a luxury car.
   ``Isn't that amazing? I never win a thing,'' Hope said from his
desert home Monday, a day after learning he had won a $50,000 BMW,
a set of luggage and a trip to Germany.
   Hope was performing Friday night in Port Arthur, Texas, and
couldn't appear at the Beverly Hilton Hotel's ``An Evening of
Elegance.'' He bought five of the 100 tickets sold for the benefit
for abused and neglected children.
   It would seem the globe-trotting entertainer wouldn't need
luggage or a free trip to Munich. He's made dozens of overseas
trips to entertain U.S. troops over Christmas, including visits to
Germany.
   ``You think you're kidding, don't you? I can use the luggage,''
Hope said.
   Asked what he would do with the car, Hope said: ``I don't know.''
   ``I bought in at the last minute. I was late getting into it so
I bought five $1,000 tickets,'' Hope said.
   When Stewart picked Hope's name, he said, ``You're not going to
believe this. It's Bob Hope.''

<HEAD>Bush Officials See Little Gain in Japanese Talks So Far</HEAD>

   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Monday the Japanese ``risk having our market closed or at least
gravely limited'' if they fail to open trade barriers to American
exports.
   Two key senators made similar comments, suggesting a
protectionist trade war, as Bush administration negotiators
admitted making ``little progress'' so far in cracking Japanese
trade bars.
   The negotiators said that it is too soon to predict whether
President Bush's weekend summit with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
will produce results but that the Japanese now ``must move rapidly
to provide solutions.''
   Hills, answering questions after a speech, said, ``There's no
question that Japan has gained its economic well-being from
worldwide trade and worldwide investment.''
   ``And if it fails to open its markets to the same extent to our
entrepreneurs as our markets are open to Japanese entrepreneurs
they risk having our market closed or at least be gravely limited,
and therein risk killing the goose that laid their golden egg as
well as ours.''
   The senators, meanwhile, said there could be a trade war if
Tokyo does not bow to U.S. demands in the ``structural impediments
talks'' before the next economic summit in July in Houston.
   ``Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States is rising fast,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ``Japan has a choice. It can either
follow the lead of the rest of the world and open its markets or it
can keep its markets closed and have the rest of the world follows
its lead.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said the Bush administration ``has
done nothing yet to warrant congratulations'' on getting Japan to
open its markets, adding Congress will not accept a ``public
relations job which attempts to buy us off.''
   ``If we didn't go far enough in 1988, believe we can go
farther,'' Danforth said, referring to the Trade Act two years ago
calling for retaliatory steps if Japan does not lower is barriers
to imports from abroad.
   Under Secretary of State Richard McCormack said U.S. negotiators
avoided pressuring Japan in the first three rounds of talks in
order to prevent the issues from becoming ``political footballs''
in Japan's parliamentary election last month.
   ``But at the next session (April 2 and 3 in Washington) the
Japanese side must move rapidly to provide solutions to the
problems we have been discussing for six months,'' he said.
   The negotiators, however, said there is no assurance that will
happen, despite the mutual pledges by Bush and Kaifu at their
hastily arranged meeting last weekend in Palm Springs, Calif., to
redouble efforts on both sides.
   ``The basic question is whether the Japanese side sees this as a
damage control exercise _ public relations _ or whether they see it
as one requiring substantive effort,'' said Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative S. Linn Williams.
   ``On that point, the jury is out,'' Williams told the Senate
Finance subcommittee on trade, chaired by Baucus. ``Proof is in the
results. It's too early for us to pass judgment.''
   J. Michael Farren, the Commerce Department's under secretary for
trade, said the U.S. trade deficit with Japan has improved by only
$7.3 billion, less than 15 percent, since 1987 despite a 45 percent
devaluation of the dollar against the yen.
   At the same time, he said, the U.S. deficit with West Germany
has declined by half and with Korea, Taiwan and other East Asian
countries it is down by 29 percent.
   While Kaifu last weekend promised Bush more action, during the
election campaign last month he ruled out repealing a retail store
law that keeps some U.S. companies out of Tokyo, Farren said.
   He also complained that Japan's trade minister has rejected
revising anti-monopoly laws that allow ``collusion among Japanese
firms'' to effectively bar U.S. steel companies access.
   ``Even more fundamentally,'' Farren said, ``there is an
all-but-explicit underlying assumption that the Japanese surplus
must be maintained ... as a hedge against anticipated oil prices
increases.
   ``Which means,'' he said, ``that American workers will continue
paying the insurance premium with the price being American jobs and
a diminishing U.S. standard of living.''
   John Taylor, a member of Bush's Council of Economic Advisers,
acknowledged the ``faster and further progress we seek has not
materialized.'' But, he said it ``would be premature to pass
judgement'' before the April round is concluded and a final report
is completed in July.

   Three plainclothes members of a drug-fighting

officers, authorities said.
   The shootings occurred at about 3:30 p.m. on Manhattan's East

   The officers were in plainclothes, members of a Drug Enforcement
Administration task force, which includes city, state and federal
officers.
   Albert Scardino, spokesman for Mayor David Dinkins, said one of

Emergency Medical Service, said one officer was in critical
condition, apparently shot in the head, and the others were stable.
   All were taken to Bellevue Hospital.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to their highest level since
last fall.
   The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.85 percent, up from 7.72 percent last
week. Another $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.79 percent, up from 7.70 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.88
percent on Sept. 5, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent on
Oct. 2.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.12 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,801.60 and 8.22 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,606.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.14
percent last week, down from 8.19 percent the previous week.

   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter

   Police said the French-built HH-65 Dolphin helicopter narrowly
missed roadside electrical wires before crash-landing seven miles
southwest of Ramey Air Station on Puerto Rico's western coast.
   Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Alan Burd said the pilot and mechanic,
the only two on board, escaped unhurt. The pilot was identified
only as Lt. J. Durfey; the mechanic's identity was not divulged.
   Burd said the helicopter was on a ``routine test flight after an

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Law Restoring Turkish Names</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Monday adopted a law
restoring names the 1.5 million ethnic Turks and other native
Bulgarian Moslems had to forsake under a forced assimilation
campaign launched by the old Communist leadership.
   Under the new law, all Bulgarian citizens can choose their own
names without restriction.
   Some ethnic Turks are still unhappy with the law, which includes
a clause that requires name changes to be approved by a court.
   About 3,000 Moslems held a protest vigil outside the
cordoned-off parliament building Monday, saying they would not
leave until they saw the law in writing. They were informed of the
law's passage by Medyud Doganov, a Turkish leader, and two
legislators.
   Also Monday, 30,000 miners and other workers were on strike in
several regions, according to the opposition newspaper
Demokratsiya. Workers at 26 mines went on strike last week,
alleging the government has not kept its promise to increase their
pay and improve working conditions.
   Ethnic Turks and other Moslems were forced to take Bulgarian
names in an often-violent assimilation campaign authored by
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov, who was deposed in November.
   Most of Bulgaria's 9 million people belong to the Bulgarian
Orthodox Church.
   The name law became the centerpiece of the parliamentary session
after other reform items were shelved, partly because they had not
been discussed with the opposition. Talks between the Communist
government and opposition were suspended three weeks ago over
disagreement over political and economic reform.
   Communists in Bulgaria, unlike those in other Soviet bloc
countries, have retained much of their clout in national politics.
   On Sunday, Moslem and opposition leaders appealed for people to
stay away from Sofia, fearing clashes between Moslems and Bulgarian
nationalists, some of whom oppose any concession to Turkish or
other minority groups.
   The assimilation campaign was marked by protests and violence.
In the past two years, authorities violently suppressed ethnic
Turkish unrest over the policy that denied them religious and other
minority rights. Amnesty International said 100 people died.
   Last year, about 320,000 ethnic Turks emigrated to Turkey after
Zhivkov granted them passports. Turkey had to close its borders to
stem the influx it said it could no longer handle.
   Since then, more than 150,000 Turks, facing poor housing and a
lack of jobs in Turkey, have returned to Bulgaria, only to find
their jobs forfeited and their homes occupied.
   The new Communist government led by moderate of Andrei Lukanov
has so far failed to complete an emergency economic program badly
needed to revamp the wobbly economy or to implement promised
political reforms.

<HEAD>Congressman Sees $8 Billion Cut in Defense Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior member of the House Armed Services
Committee predicted Monday that Congress will try to slash more
than $8 billion from President Bush's $292 billion defense budget
for fiscal 1991.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, who also serves on the House Budget
Committee, questioned Army officials on what impact a significant
reduction in the president's spending blueprint for the fiscal year
that will begin Oct. 1 would have on their service.
   ``I don't like to play a `what if' game,'' Leath said. ``If we
hold the cut to $8 billion, some (members of Armed Services) would
feel some kind of victory.''
   Leath suggested that if such a cut were made, the Army might be
faced with a reduction of $3 billion to $4 billion from the
proposed total.
   ``It would be devastating if we took that kind of cut,'' said
the Army chief of staff, Gen. Carl E. Vuono, who predicted that
personnel and readiness expenditures would bear the brunt of the
cuts.
   Reducing the size of the forces _ not spending on major weapons
programs _ would result in the quick savings many members of
Congress expect from the defense budget with the Soviet threat to
the West diminishing but the deficit increasing.
   ``You would be back to fracturing the force and I don't use that
term lightly,'' Vuono told the House Armed Services Committee.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
panel, said the $8 billion is ``not far off of what's being kicked
around.'' The committee chairman suggested that Vuono and Army
Secretary Michael P.W. Stone start planning on restructuring the
force to reflect the expected congressional cuts.
   The fiscal 1990 defense budget calls for an increase from this
year's $286.8 billion in outlays to $292 billion _ a 2 percent
reduction after adjusting for anticipated inflation.

<TEXT>
   New Yorkers hungering for a taste of the good
life had to shell out 6.4 percent more dough last year than in
1988, in part because of a 28 percent jump in the price of caviar,
according to a survey released Monday.
   The annual survey, commissioned by Moet &amp; Chandon champagne,
tracked the cost of a dozen luxury items and services in New York
City, and found they went up in price last year faster than the 4.6
percent rate of the government's Consumer Price Index.
   There were a few relative bargains for the well-to-do, though:
the price of a man's Rolex watch remained the same as it was in
1988 _ $11,700 _ and a pound of imported chocolate truffles was
still $36.
   The fee for a wash, cut and blow dry at a leading Manhattan hair
salon actually decreased, from $70 to $65.
   But Dom Petroff Russian caviar rose 27.7 percent to $60 for 30
grams, up from $47. The next biggest rise was one day of maid
service, up 13.6 percent to $100, from $88.
   Among the other items measured were a ticket to the Broadway
show ``Cats'' (up 10 percent to $55), a bottle of Hennessy X.O
cognac (up 10 percent to $87), a round-trip ticket between New York
and Paris on the Concorde (up 8.9 percent to $5,308), and a
Rolls-Royce Corniche III convertible (up 5 percent to $215,800).

   For 31 years, Felix Itz has been
driving to work as Runnels County surveyor, taking field notes and
searching courthouse records. He got the job at age 69.
   About 170 people gathered at the American Legion Hall for Itz's
100th birthday party Sunday. Asked to describe his lifestyle, Itz,
a man of few words, said: ``I'm just piddling around.''
   He also was reluctant to give away secrets on longevity. ``I
haven't passed on yet,'' he told the Houston Chronicle.
   The secret could be in his genes. His father lived to be 88 and
his mother to 92. Both his maternal grandparents made it into their
90s.
   Itz plans to remain on the job until his current four-year term
expires on Dec. 31.
   ``Grandma always complained that he worked too hard,''
granddaughter Nancy Simpson said.
   Itz's wife of 67 years, Zelma, died in 1981. His son, Milford,
73, and 87-year-old baby sister, Cora Lehne, are both retired.
   Itz has been hospitalized just once: to have gallstones removed
in 1985. After two weeks, he was back on the job.
   He actually retired once, from the state highway department in
1958, but soon tired of idleness. He ran for the county surveyor's
job at the age of 69 and has held it since, without opposition.

   One woman ate a dozen cockroaches. Two others
covered themselves with syrup, coconut, almonds and chocolate to
look like Almond Joy candy bars. With $10,000 on offer, no stunt
was too bizarre.
   Radio station KKBQ offered the prize to whoever could carry out
the most outrageous stunt. And a dozen contestants were willing.
   One woman shaved her shoulder-length hair and let people sign
their names on her head, and a man shaved his underarm hair, topped
it with shaving cream and ate the mixture.
   Two women showed their love of hot dogs by sitting in a small
pool filled with wieners and spraying ketchup and mustard over each
other.
   But the grand prize went to 19-year-old Colin Thiele, who
covered his body with honey and chicken feathers, jumped into a
pool of pig poop and bobbed for apples and carrots.
   ``I faxed the idea to the radio station and I didn't ever think
it would get this far. And yes I would do it again,'' said Thiele.
``For $10,000, it's hard to turn down.''

   Three sisters on the same team can be
confusing enough, but it's beyond confusion when they're identical
triplets.
   ``It's really funny,'' said Bonnie Collins, who's on the same
track team as her sisters, Betty and Bobbie. ``People will look at
us and say, `Look here, they all have ...'''
   ``` ... the same faces,''' chimed in Bobbie and Betty.
   The sisters look so much alike it's tough even for family
members to tell them apart.
   ``We probably don't sit still long enough,'' Bobbie said.
   Being good sisters is what makes them strong, Betty said. ``I
think God put us here as triplets to be stronger than if we were
born a year apart instead of only five minutes. I think he had a
plan for us.''
   Bonnie agreed and said that being triplets also is a case of
strength in numbers. ``With 10 older brothers and sisters, it
would've been hard for one girl to be the only youngest,'' she said.
   The triplets are Iresse Collins' 11th, 12th and 13th children,
and although they are 21 years old, their mother still calls them
her babies.
   ``We've been through the same stages of life together _ acting
stupid, puberty, college and boyfriends. And we're still friends,''
Bonnie said. ``That's what's best. Being best friends.''

   An USAir DC-9 returned to the airport
shortly after takeoff Monday because of a bomb threat, an airline
official said.
   Flight 195, carrying 14 passengers and a crew of five, was
turned around because of remarks by two people who approached the
gate as the plane was preparing to take off, said Susan Young, a
spokeswoman for USAir in Arlington.
   They demanded that the plane be brought back so they could
board, Ms. Young said.
   When the couple was told that was impossible, ``they made
remarks to the effect that `you'll bring it back,' and some
comments about a bomb in their luggage,'' Ms. Young said.
   By then, the plane had taken off. USAir officials in Norfolk
recalled the plane, which landed without incident around 2:45 p.m.
   The plane was taken to a remote part of the field, and one piece
of luggage was taken off, said Wayne Shank, the airport's deputy
executive director. The passengers also were taken off, he said.
   The two people who made the comment were turned over to
authorities, Ms. Young said.
   ``Any type of joking about any type of bomb on board is a
federal offense and taken very seriously,'' she said.

   Campbell Soup Co. has voluntarily recalled
24,000 packages of its Microwave Chunky Beef Soup because the soup
was not heat-processed and could contain harmful organisms, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, we strongly urge
consumers to avoid opening or tasting the product,'' said Lester M.
Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
   The microwave soup was made in the company's Maxton, N.C.,
facility and distributed to retail stores in Indiana, Michigan,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Some of the 24,000 packages also were distributed to the
military, but the amount was not determined, said Jim Greene, a
spokesman for Crawford.
   The soup was packaged in paper cartons, each containing one
9{-ounce microwavable plastic bowl with a ``metallized sealed
lid,'' the announcement said. The suspected product is identified
by a three-line code stamped on the side panel of the package.
   Only packages with the code ``Dec90, Est4R, CO9J'' are being
recalled.
   The problem was reported to USDA after company officials
discovered that one day's production was not sterile and ``could
allow the growth of organisms that cause illness, if those
organisms were present,'' the agency said.
   Greene said there was a ``high probability'' the suspected
product contains organisms that can cause botulism, a deadly form
of food poisoning. None has been found in the product at this time,
however, he said.
   Consumers with questions about the recall may call the toll-free
USDA hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Monday
through Friday. In the Washington metropolitan area, the number if

<HEAD>Power Plant Worker Accused of Spiking Cooler With Radioactive
Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAINT JOHN, New Brunswick (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear power plant worker
was charged Monday with spiking a lunchroom cooler with radioactive
water that eight men drank before the contamination was discovered.
   The eight who drank the contaminated water last month at the
Point Lepreau plant have a slightly higher chance of getting
cancer, officials said, but are in no immediate health danger.
   Daniel George Maston, 33, assistant operator at the plant
bordering Saint John, was arrested Sunday in the incident, which at
least one power plant worker said appeared to be a practical joke
gone awry.
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police released few details of the
investigation that led to Maston's arrest.
   During a court appearance Monday, Maston was charged with
causing a noxious substance to be administered with intent to
endanger lives or cause bodily harm. The charge carries a maximum
penalty of 14 years in prison.
   The contamination was discovered Feb. 22 during routine urine
checks of plant employees.
   Police officials said the day before, a glass of slightly
radioactive heavy water was dumped into a 5.2-gallon cooler that
provides water to a dispenser that mixes it into fruit juice.
   Heavy water is used to cool the power plant's reactor. It is not
radioactive itself but the water is exposed to radioactivity from
the plant's uranium fuel rods.
   Maston did not speak during his 10-minute appearance. Provincial
court Judge Bill McCarroll ordered him held until he finds a lawyer
and enters a plea Wednesday.
   The courtroom was crowded with other workers from the nuclear
power plant, but only one, Trent Lamb, spoke with reporters.
   He described Maston as a ``quiet guy'' and said many Lepreau
employees believe the water contamination was not malicious but a
bad practical joke. Lamb was not among the eight who drank the
tainted drink.
   Maston does not work in the control room of the power plant,
officials said. He has been an employee of Lepreau for several
years.
   Colin Nichols, president of the union that represents more than
half the workers at Point Lepreau, refused to discuss Maston or the
charge against him. But Nichols said the arrest has eased tensions.
   ``People are feeling a little more comfortable,'' said Nichols,
head of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local
2309. ``But there are still a whole lot of questions we all want
answered about why someone would do this.''
   The workers who drank the spiked juice, none of whom have been
identified publicly, met Monday afternoon with a doctor who advises
the Atomic Energy Control Board, which regulates the Canadian
nuclear industry.
   The doctor was brought in to answer the workers' questions about
their exposure, officials said.
   One worker was exposed to almost four times what is considered
the annual safe limit of radiation, officials said. The others
received lesser exposures.
   The annual limit of radiation for workers in the nuclear
industry is set at 50 millisieverts. The average person is exposed
to about three millisieverts a year, from the sun's rays and
uranium on Earth.
   Under federal regulations, none of the eight will be allowed to
work in areas of the generating station where they would be exposed
to radiation for one year.
   ``Before, most people were very proud to say the worked at
Lepreau but right now ... people are pointing fingers, making jokes
about glowing in the dark,'' Nichols said. ``Our production record
is world-class and all that goes out the window with this black
mark.''

<HEAD>Both Sides Look to Governor In Hawaii Labor Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers picketed 11 major hotels Monday as both
sides awaited word on whether Gov. John Waihee would intervene in a
2-day-old strike.
   The walkout by 7,500 employees began early Saturday after
negotiators for Local 5 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union
rejected management's final offer.
   Economists have said the strike could badly damage the Hawaiian
economy if it is lengthy and if news reports give potential
visitors the impression that the state's tourist industry is
paralyzed.
   The strike affects about one-fourth of the 37,000 hotel rooms in
Waikiki, the state's prime tourist destination, and one-seventh of
the 70,000 hotel rooms in the state, according to the Hawaii
Visitors Bureau.
   The union has filed two unfair labor practice charges against
the hotels, including one accusing management of refusing to
bargain in good faith.
   ``Their charges are totally groundless,'' said William Crawford,
executive director of the Council of Hawaii Hotels. ``We bargained
in good faith all the way through.''
   Management and union officials were waiting for a decision by
Waihee, who was being briefed by his staff after returning from the
mainland during the weekend.
   Waihee helped the two sides work out an agreement during 1987
contract talks.
   Hotels have continued to operate during the strike, using
management to fill in at unionized jobs. Some hotel services have
been curtailed.
   Crawford sharply criticized union leader Tony Rutledge, who
encouraged union workers to exercise civil disobedience by engaging
in sit-ins at the affected hotels, even if it meant getting
arrested. No one has been arrested so far.
   ``I think that's very irresponsible of the union, making them
criminals,'' Crawford said. ``That cannot have a productive effect
on negotiations.''
   Rutledge has been meeting with his staff to plan strategy to
bring national attention to the dispute.
   ``We don't plan to lose,'' he said. ``If they (the employers)
knew what I know and what we plan to do ... they would settle.''
   Rutldge plans to extend the strike to non-union hotels owned by
the same companies as the affected hotels. If the strike continues
to next week, the international union will begin informational
pickets on the mainland, he said.
   Hotel workers who do not receive tips now earn an average of
$9.22 an hour, while tipped workers earn an average of $4.87 an
hour.
   The union turned down a four-year contract that includes what
management calculates as a wage-and-benefit package of 7 percent
annually, but which the union calculates at 4 percent a year.

   Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving
sibling of former President Carter, died Monday of the type of
cancer that killed three other family members. She was 63.
   Mrs. Spann had been diagnosed in December as having pancreatic
cancer, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister,
Ruth Carter Stapleton; and her other brother, Billy Carter.
   Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to
other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in 1983.
   Mrs. Spann, who lived on a farm southwest of Plains, died at
Sumter Regional Hospital at about 1 a.m. She was with the former
president and his wife, Rosalynn, several close friends and her
husband, Walter Spann.
   Mrs. Spann, an avid motorcyclist, will be buried Tuesday at a
graveside service at Lebanon Cemetery in Plains following a funeral
procession led by fellow motorcyclists. All but Mrs. Stapleton are
buried in the cemetery.
   Billy Carter's widow, Sybil, said the family is bewildered by
the disease and hopes that scientists can learn more about it.
   ``It's very sad for all of us,'' she said. ``It's just something
we don't understand. Our family is grieved and saddened.''
   Carrie Harmon, a spokeswoman at the Carter Presidential Center
in Atlanta, said the former president was issuing no statement
about his sister's death. Carter will depart as scheduled on a
Middle East trip later this week.
   As residents of her small farming community mourned Mrs. Spann's
death, a group of about 10 fellow bikers, some in jeans and leather
jackets, consoled her husband at the family farm.
   The Spanns were described by friends as private people who
shunned the publicity that Carter's presidency brought to the south
Georgia town of 600.
   A 6-foot wire fence protects the Spann's white frame house from
unwanted guests. A sign posted at one of the gates says,
``Motorcycles Only.''
   Spann, wearing a leather vest, dark glasses and with long,
flowing gray hair, said his wife had requested the motorcycle
procession.
   He and the other bikers gathered in the yard declined to be
interviewed. A red Harley-Davidson motorcycle was parked nearby.
Some of the bikers had beards, while some wore jackets and shirts
with Harley-Davidson logos.
   A burly biker wearing a military-style beret stood a few feet
from a reporter with his arms crossed over his chest, as if to
protect Spann from unwelcome guests.
   In downtown Plains, tourists visited a Jimmy Carter museum in
the railroad depot Monday and Mrs. Spann's cousin, Hugh Carter,
chatted with visitors in his antique shop.
   ``She was a fun person, outgoing, smart and beautiful,'' he
recalled. ``She had lots of friends. The mood everywhere is very
sad.''
   ``Everybody is concerned. We're going to miss her,'' said Walter
Dozier, a neighbor.
   Mrs. Spann belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights
organization and was named Most Outstanding Female Motorcyclist in
the nation in 1978. Just after her cancer was diagnosed, she said
through a spokeswoman that she and her husband planned to ride
their motorcycles to Florida for the weekend.
   She and her husband traveled widely by motorcycle and at one
time she received an award for having biked 100,000 miles.
   Mrs. Spann was co-author of the book ``Letters from Home'' in
the early 1970s, based on letters written by her mother while she
served with the Peace Corps in India.
   Besides her brother and husband, Mrs. Spann is survived by a
son, William C. Spann.

   The Supreme Court slammed shut the federal
courthouse door Monday to fresh appeals by many convicted
criminals, including death row inmates.
   In two 5-4 rulings, the court generally barred defendants from
using new constitutional rulings to attack state court convictions
after exhausting initial rounds of appeals.
   The justices upheld a South Carolina death row prisoner's
conviction and reinstated the death sentence of a convicted
Oklahoma murderer.
   The court's four dissenters and the American Civil Liberties
Union denounced the rulings.
   The ACLU, in a statement signed by three officials, said the
court has ``sent a clear signal that it will turn away and allow
people to be executed in plain violation of the Bill of Rights.''
   In the South Carolina case, the court upheld the conviction of
Horace Butler, sentenced to die for the 1980 murder of Pamela Lane,
a clerk at a Charleston-area convenience store.
   The court refused to apply retroactively to Butler's case a 1988
ruling that limits police questioning. The 1988 decision said
police may not question a suspect about a crime _ the one for which
he was arrested or any other _ once he asks for a lawyer.
   The 1988 ruling was foreshadowed by a 1981 decision banning a
second round of police questions about the crime for which a
suspect was arrested.
   Butler was in jail on a relatively minor charge and had obtained
a lawyer's representation after refusing to talk to police. Police
later questioned him about an unrelated murder, and Butler
confessed.
   Butler asked a federal judge to throw out his murder conviction
on grounds that, under the Supreme Court's 1988 ruling, his rights
were violated by unlawful police interrogation.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
it was too late for the 1988 ruling to be of any help to Butler.
   Prisoners cannot rely on new high court rulings to overturn
their convictions as long as the state appeals courts that upheld
the convictions reasonably interpreted then-current constitutional
rulings, Rehnquist said.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
decision ``strips state prisoners of virtually any meaningful
federal review of the constitutionality of their incarceration.''
   ``After today, despite constitutional defects in the state
processes leading to their conviction or sentencing, state
prisoners will languish in jail _ and others like Butler will die _
because state courts were reasonable, even though wrong,'' Brennan
said.
   He said that with Monday's ruling ``the court has finally
succeeded in its thinly veiled crusade to eviscerate'' federal laws
aimed at protecting criminal defendants' rights.
   Brennan was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   In the Oklahoma case, the same five majority justices ruled that
Robyn Leroy Parks is barred from contending that a jury wrongly was
told to ignore ``sympathy'' before it sentenced him to death.
   But Kennedy wrote that Parks was barred from raising that
argument after exhausting his direct appeals in state courts.
   Parks was convicted of the 1977 killing of Abdullah Ibrahim, a
gas station attendant in Oklahoma City. At Parks' sentencing trial,
the judge told jurors, ``You must avoid any influence of sympathy,
sentiment, passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor when
imposing sentence.''
   The justices overturned a ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals that said the judge's instruction undermined the jury's
consideration of ``mitigating evidence.'' The appeals court had
said Parks should be resentenced.

<HEAD>Argentine Austerity Measures Provoke Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees occupied the national
mortgage bank Monday, protesting the decision to close it in an
austerity plan that includes mass layoffs to combat inflation
averaging 80 percent a month.
   Teachers boycotted classes, disrupting the start of a new school
year after the summer recess, and professors at the 27 national
universities also were on strike. All seek higher pay.
   Court clerks, who have shut the federal court system twice in
two weeks, planned to begin another pay strike Tuesday and doctors
at municipal hospitals said they would walk out Wednesday.
   Banks and foreign exchange houses were closed Monday while the
Economy Ministry put the finishing touches on measures to prop the
austral currency, which has lost 99 percent of its value the past
year.
   ``They are committing an error'' in shutting the bank that
finances low-income housing, Juan Zanola, director of the powerful
Bankworkers Association, said about the decision to close the
mortgage bank.
   When banks reopen, the 150,000-member union may strike the other
four national banks, including the Central Bank, as it did two
weeks ago when the government announced a bank restructuring plan
Zanola said.
   Real wages have shrunk up to one-half because of inflation,
which was 79 percent in January and probably equal that in
February. A recession has stalled business activity and forced one
of every five adults out of a job or into part-time work.
   The austral has lost so much of its value that prices and wages
are quoted increasingly in dollars.
   Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez said on national television
Sunday night the government, which has played a central role in
Argentina's economy for decades, is ``on the verge of bankruptcy.''
   Public employees beyond retirement age will be dropped from
payrolls, he said, and those within two years of retirement will be
suspended with pay. Overtime will be curbed and vacancies will not
be filled.
   Gonzalez estimated those measures, along with suspension of
federal subsidies and deferral of payments to state contractors,
would save $2 billion a year.
   He did not say how many public employees would be laid off or
retired, but newspapers speculated tens of thousands might have to
go. About one-fourth of Argentina's 12.5 million workers are
employed by the government.
   The General Labor Confederation, with 3 million members
Argentina's largest labor organization, said it was studying the
government measures. It has criticized earlier versions and has not
ruled out a general strike.
   Restructuring of the national banks is aimed at reducing losses
that contribute to a deficit this year of about $70 billion, or
12-15 percent of gross national product.
   Because of poor lending and collection practices, the mortgage
bank has run up a deficit of $1 billion with the Central Bank.
Until now, the Central Bank simply printed money to cover such
losses.
   A report last month in the newspaper Pagina 12, citing bank
data, said the National Development Bank was owed $1.9 billion by
its 60 largest debtors, including the state telephone, electric,
coal, railroad and gas companies.
   Closing the mortgage bank and laying off public employees are
seen as a test of the government's resolve to address the deficit
without printing money.
   In past months, the government has announced plans to retire or
transfer hundreds of employees of the state railroad, mortgage bank
and Congress. It backed off in each case because of union
opposition.

   President Bush said Monday that parents must
``spark the flame of curiosity'' in their children but that the
national Parent Teacher Association may have to supply the matches.
   The president's comments to about 250 PTA leaders at the White
House came hours after the organization released a poll that found
that fewer than half of those surveyed had visited their children's
schools to participate in a back-to-school night or attend
parent-organization meetings during the fall of 1989.
   Bush criticized parents for ``thinking of education as a service
we can hand over to the school boards, much the same way we expect
our cities to provide electricity or water.''
   ``Education is not a utility. Education is a national mission
that must include parents,'' he said, noting that a school program
``won't kiss away the pain from an injured knee'' or ``calm the
fears of a child about to get a first shot'' or ``instill a
lifelong love of learning.''
   ``But parents can spark the flame of curiosity by reading to
their children, every night,'' Bush said, adding that the 6.6
million-member PTA can provide the needed leadership.
   ``There is no organization in America that can reach as many
schools and as many parents as you can _ not the state governments,
not even the federal government,'' he said.
   Bush was accompanied by his wife, Barbara, who has made literacy
one of her priorities.
   ``Many parents are doing only half their job when it comes to
getting a good education for their children,'' national PTA
President Ann Lynch said in releasing the poll. ``Too many
(parents) sit at home and complain about the schools without ever
setting foot through the doors to find out how they can help.''
   The most common reasons for visiting schools included attending
a scheduled parent-teacher conference, which 71 percent had
attended, or class or school program, which 64 percent had attended.
   The survey, commissioned by Newsweek magazine for the national
PTA and Chrysler's Dodge Division, was based on a national sample
of parents in 538 households with children enrolled in kindergarten
through 12th grade. Ninety percent of the children are in public
school with 10 percent in either private or parochial schools.
   While school involvement was often low, the survey found most
parents said they were very active in their children's education at
home. Two of every three, 69 percent, said they discussed school
topics with their children nearly every school day. More than half,
58 percent, helped with homework at least two to three times a
week, and 52 percent read to or with their children at least once a
week.
   More than half, 57 percent, said their own role was ``extremely
influential'' in their children's learning. However, slightly more
than half, 53 percent, of the parents surveyed were not involved in
any kind of parent group. Many of those parents cited lack of time
or work commitments as a deterrent to participation.
   ``We're all busy with work and family commitments, but it's
amazing how we can find the time for things that are really
important to us,'' said Ms. Lynch. ``A few hours or less a month is
all it takes to keep in touch and help at the school.''
   Among parents who are involved in parent groups, a large
majority are more likely to help with fund raising, 80 percent, and
extracurricular events, 72 percent, than to volunteer in
classrooms, 52 percent, or participate in curriculum or
policy-making, 33 percent.
   ``Parents tend to get involved in fund raising because it's easy
and makes them feel as though they are doing something for their
child's school,'' said Ms. Lynch, noting that parents also must
work for better school funding and participate in school
decision-making.
   The survey was conducted by ICR Survey Research Group in Media,
Pa. between Dec. 29 and Jan. 7. The margin of error is plus or
minus 4.5 percentage points.

   Authorities in Tibet have barred tourists until
mid-March, when several dates important to Tibetans seeking
independence from China will have passed, a Western tourist said
Monday.
   The tourist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said tour
agents at Chengdu in the southwest, the air gateway to Lhasa, had
told travelers none would be allowed until March 15.
   She said the few tourists already in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital,
would be allowed to remain until the end of their planned stays.
Lhasa has been under martial law since last year.
   Lhasa is in the midst of Moinlam Qenmo, an important 10-day
prayer festival. Chinese authorities have called for increased
vigilance and said that, if ``separatist elements dare to stir up
trouble again, we will resolutely strike a heavy blow.''
   Pro-independence Tibetans have fought security forces on March 5
in each of the past two years. Sixteen people were killed and more
than 100 injured in three days of confrontation in 1989.
   China expelled all foreign tourists from Lhasa and imposed
martial law in the city March 8 of last year. In 1988, 24 Tibetans
died in anti-Chinese rioting, Western travelers reported.
   An unsuccessful uprising March 10, 1959, led to the exile of the
Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader.
   Four times since September 1987, Tibetan demonstrations for
independence have become battles in which Chinese police and
soldiers opened fire on the crowds.
   China occupied Tibet in 1950 and claims it has been part of
Chinese territory for seven centuries.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a mid-season schedule shift, the Fox
television network said Monday it would air two new series, is
moving ``The Tracy Ullman Show'' to Saturdays and is taking ``The
Reporters'' series off until fall.
   Fox also cancelled the low-rated ``It's Gary Shandling's Show,''
whose self-deprecating star last month said the show would stop
production this spring.
   Also Monday, cable TV's Lifetime network said it had bought
rights to rerun the Shandling and Ullman shows. Lifetime said it
would start repeats of Ullman's series in September, and
Shandling's in June next year.
   The new Fox series are ``The Outsiders,'' an hour-long drama
series co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola, the Academy
Award-winning director, and ``In Living Color,'' a half-hour sketch
comedy series starring Kennan Ivory Wayans.
   The latter series will premiere April 21, preceding Ullman's
show on Saturday nights. Ullman's half-hour comedy series, which
had been shown on Sundays, will shift to Saturdays starting April 7.
   ``The Outsiders,'' about growing up in the 1960s, will start in
its regular Sunday time period on April 1, after a 90-minute
premiere on March 25.
   Fox's ``The Reporters'' is a Saturday newsmagazine series with
five reporters. It will begin a production hiatus on March 31, Fox
said.
   Its executive producer, Gerald Stone, said in a statement the
show has been on the air 20 months without a break, and ``we look
forward to the chance to regroup and fine-tune ourselves, as well
as get stories in the can for the fall.''

   With the gubernatorial primaries a week
away, former Gov. Mark White is the sudden Democratic front-runner
and state Treasurer Ann Richards is struggling after refusing to
say if she ever misused drugs.
   On the Republican side, three contenders are trying to keep
multimillionaire oilman Clayton Williams from winning the
nomination outright without a runoff.
   After pumping more than $4 million of his own into a slick
television ad campaign, the colorful Williams stood at 45 percent
in a Dallas Morning News-Houston Chronicle poll published Feb. 25.
If he wins 50 percent in the March 13 balloting, he avoids a runoff
election for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Republican Gov.
Bill Clements.
   Among the Democrats, Ms. Richards had been front-runner since
entering the race in June, until White pulled ahead in the Feb. 25
poll, which showed him with 34 percent to Ms. Richards' 31 percent.
State Attorney General Jim Mattox was third at 17 percent.
   Ms. Richards, who rose to national attention after her keynote
speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention _ where she said
George Bush was born with ``a silver foot in his mouth'' _ insists
her refusal to disclose whether she's ever used an illegal drug
isn't a problem.
   ``I have been tested by fire, and the fire has lost,'' said Ms.
Richards, a recovering alcoholic. ``I feel truthfully that it has
energized a great number of people who feel it is important to do
and say what I am saying, and that is: If you need help, get help.''
   But her opponents and others watching the race disagreed.
   ``Voters are more tolerant of that than lack of candor,'' George
Christian, an Austin political consultant and former press
secretary to President Johnson, said of drug use.
   The question arose in two debates that were televised statewide.
White and Mattox said they had never used illegal drugs. Ms.
Richards didn't answer the question directly.
   ``My addiction was alcohol,'' she said, adding: ``I have
revealed more about my personal life, including my alcoholism and
my recovery, for 10 years, than any person who has ever run for
governor.
   ``By continuing to raise these questions I think that we are
sending a very sad message to a lot of people who see that if they
seek treatment they will forever bear the stigma of their
addiction.''
   The issue came up again at a news conference Monday. Ms.
Richards again refused to say whether she had used illegal drugs,
but did say she'd never knowingly commited a felony offense.
   Unless Ms. Richards answers the question, Republicans will make
it an issue if she wins the nomination, her opponents said. ``It
won't be pretty. It's a serious question,'' said White.
   Ms. Richards attacked White and Mattox on Monday for making her
refusal to answer the drug question a campaign issue.
   ``No one has ever raised this question while I have been
managing all of the money of the state of Texas,'' she said. ``The
only time this question was raised was when I got in the way of
those boys who want to be governor.''
   White, governor from 1983 to 1987, has risen steadily in the
polls since entering the race in November as he and Mattox have
dueled over the death penalty and taxes.
   Mattox, who as attorney general has attended most of the 33
Texas executions since they resumed in 1982, has emphasized his
crime-fighting record. His television commercials show him walking
in front of prison bars.
   White responded with a chilling commercial that showed him
walking beside giant photos of felons who were put to death during
his term.
   ``Only a governor can make executions happen. I did. And I
will,'' White said.
   Mattox and Ms. Richards have even become issues in the
Republican race.
   Struggling to cut into Williams' staggering lead, rival Kent
Hance has aired an ad focusing on the oilman's contribution of
$1,000 to Mattox. ``Do we know the real Clayton Williams yet?''
Hance's ad asks. Williams also gave $200 to Ms. Richards.
   Williams, who is making his first bid for public office, insists
his donations were made while he was a businessman and before he
considered entering politics.
   Hance, a former Democratic congressman who sponsored President
Reagan's 1981 tax cut legislation, is rnning a distant second to
Williams with about 22 percent support, according to recent polls.
   The two other major contenders have earned most of the
endorsements from the state's major newspapers. But both _ Tom Luce
of Dallas, lawyer for billionaire H. Ross Perot, and former
secretary of state Jack Rains of Houston _ remain in single digits
in the polls.

intelligence unit planted bombs, were suspects in political
killings and plotted to harass Archbishop Desmond Tutu by sending
him a baboon fetus, an intelligence official said Monday.
   Gen. Rudolph Badenhorst, head of the Military Intelligence
branch of the Defense Force, was the first witness to testify
before a judicial inquiry into allegations of military and police
participation in death squads.
   Opposition leaders claim the squads may have been involved in
about 60 unsolved murders of anti-government activists in the past
decade.
   Badenhorst said the Civil Cooperation Bureau _ a unit so secret
that President F.W. de Klerk says he was not told of its existence
until recently _ had blown up a Pretoria store owned by an
anti-apartheid activist, exploded a bomb at a community hall in a
mixed-race township near Cape Town and planned to deliver a baboon
fetus to Tutu, an anti-apartheid leader and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Badenhorst gave no reason for the plan to send the fetus. He
said the idea was called ``Operation Apie.''
   The intelligence chief said an internal military investigation
begun in November revealed that prominent anti-apartheid activists
such as black mineworkers leader Cyril Ramaphosa, the Rev. Frank
Chikane of the South African Council of Churches and Jay Naidoo,
general secretary of the nation's largest trade union federation,
were on a list to have their movements monitored.
   He maintained that he did not know the bureau existed before
November and he didn't know the purpose of the surveillance.
   The secret unit reportedly consisted of cells of civilians,
mostly former policemen, in undercover operations against
government opponents.
   An attorney for the Civil Cooperation Bureau said its chief,
Col. Joe Verster, had been detained Friday for questioning by
police who are investigating the 1989 assassinations of David
Webster, a Johannesburg anthropologist, and Anton Lubowski, the
only white executive member of the South-West African People's
Organization in Namibia.
   Badenhorst confirmed that three former policemen wanted in
Lubowski's death were members of the Civil Cooperation Bureau. All
three disappeared last month after police in Namibia issued
warrants for their arrests. Badenhorst said the Civil Cooperation
Bureau was not involved in Webster's slaying.
   He said that during questioning by military investigators,
Verster had seemed surprised at some of the activities of bureau
members, and was especially surprised by the hiring of an
ex-policeman, Ferdie Barnard, after he had been released from
prison.
   De Klerk, who became president in August, said Defense Minister
Magnus Malan did not tell him of the Civil Cooperation Bureau until
January. Badenhorst told the commission de Klerk had not sanctioned
any of the unit's activities.
   Malan said Monday he did not know the bureau existed until
November.
   The defense minister has said he never authorized killings or
other illegal acts, but he has come under increasing pressure from
opposition parties to resign.
   In another judicial inquiry ordered by de Klerk, Supreme Court
Justice Richard Goldstone ruled that Clayton Sizwe Sithole,
identified by friends as the former boyfriend of Nelson Mandela's
youngest daughter, Zindziwe, committed suicide in police custody on
Jan. 27.
   Sithole had been arrested with others in a murder investigation,
and after police interrogation he was found hanging by his
shoelaces and belt at the Johannesburg police headquarters.
   Goldstone said there were no recent injuries on his body other
than those associated with hanging.

   Gusts whipping the Mojave
Desert on Monday prevented NASA workers from preparing the space
shuttle Atlantis for its return to Florida after a not-so-secret
four-day mission in space.
   ``It's a good day to fly a kite,'' said Atlantis processing
director Conrad Nagel, as gusts reached 45 mph.
   The wind also delayed efforts to investigate the apparent
leaking of hydraulic fluid that developed before the shuttle landed
at Edwards on Sunday, Nagel said.
   Atlantis and its five-man crew landed on a dry desert lakebed
after an officially classified mission reportedly to launch a $500
million spy satellite.
   The shuttle was to be hoisted into position Monday inside a
100-foot-tall steel trusswork so workers could prepare it to be
mounted atop a modified Boeing 747 jetliner for a piggyback flight
to Florida. But Nagel said the work would have to wait until late
Monday because of the wind.
   He said preliminary inspection revealed possible hydraulic fluid
leaks in three parts of the shuttle, but added that they hadn't
posed any danger in Sunday's landing and probably weren't a safety
issue. The shuttle has three redundant hydraulic systems that
operate shuttle steering during re-entry.
   Inspectors for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
also found 62 heat-shield tiles with ``dings,'' including one that
probably will be replaced. But Nagel called the damage
insignificant and said Atlantis was in excellent shape.
   Nagel said he had hoped Atlantis would be ready for the flight
to Florida on Friday, but the wind-related delay meant the trip
would be Saturday.
   Had the winds come earlier, they could have delayed Sunday's
landing. The shuttle's launch last Wednesday from the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida had been delayed five times by weather, a
computer glitch and the sore throat of the commander, Navy Capt.
John O. Creighton.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for April 12 when Discovery
is to begin a five-day mission to deploy the $1.55 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   Discovery was towed Monday to the vehicle assembly building at
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA spokeswoman Pat Phillips said
in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>President Of Cyprus Lobbies Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Cyprus pressed congressional
leaders Monday to help break deadlocked negotiations over his
country's future.
   President George Vassiliou said that his discussions went ``very
well. ... It was very productive, very useful.''
   Vassiliou flew to Washington on a private visit after
U.N.-sponsored talks on the future of Cyprus collapsed last week.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar called off the
negotiations that included both Vassiliou and Rauf Denktash, the
leader of Cyprus' Turkish community. The island nation in the
Mediterranean has been divided since 1974 when the Turks invaded
the island.
   Turkey maintains roughly 35,000 troops on the island although
only 18 percent of the population lives in the Turkish section.
   The island's president met with Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., as
well as with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., the panel's
ranking minority member, and Sens. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and Larry
Pressler, R-S.D.
   Vassiliou was expected to see national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft late Monday.
   Vassiliou said in a brief interview that he would like to see a
``more clear-cut policy on behalf of the administration and
Congress to help bring an end forever ... to this problem that has
been with us so long.''
   Broomfield said Vassiliou had ``won a lot of support in
Congress'' for his efforts, and the Michigan Republican criticized
Denktash for not ``acting in good faith'' at the U.N. talks.
   He said he favored cutting military aid to Turkey until Ankara
pressured Denktash to adopt a more conciliatory negotiating stance.
   While Broomfield doubted Congress would take such a drastic
action, he said members would work with the Bush administration to
see if it could be more forceful in prodding the parties toward
reconciliation.
   Pressler predicted that Congress would take an initiative,
perhaps in the form of a resolution, ``to try to get the talks with
the Turks off dead center.''
   The Bush administration has followed the lead of the U.N.
secretary general in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to
the conflict on the island, a State Department official said.
   A spokesman for the Turkish-Cypriot office in Washington, was
out of the office and unavailable for comment about the
negotiations involving the island.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Monday he never tried
marijuana because he was ``busy doing other things, like playing
ball and studying.''
   ``It was never part of my environment,'' said the 57-year-old
New York Democrat during the taping of a weekly radio interview.
   But Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 presidential contender,
said ``that doesn't mean anything. That doesn't make you good or
bad.''
   The governor's comment came during an interview for Albany radio
station WAMC's weekly ``Capitol Connection'' when he was asked
about some Massachusetts politicians who have recently admitted to
having tried marijuana.
   ``People are free to confess if they feel they should. That's
fine by me, if they wish to,'' said Cuomo.
   Nonetheless, Cuomo said ``politicians should discourage a
practice of everybody stepping forward and confessing everything
they ever did, because then you construct a new category. When does
it end? Did you ever shout at your wife, et cetera, et cetera.''

<HEAD>Storm Brings Snow And Wind To The West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm packing gusty winds spread up to a foot of snow over
sections of the West on Monday after coming ashore from the Pacific
Ocean over the weekend.
   The snow was expected to move onto the Plains overnight. Winter
storm watches were in effect through Tuesday for northeastern
Colorado, the Nebraska Panhandle and southwestern and south-central
South Dakota.
   By early Monday, up to 11 inches of snow covered the northern
mountains of Utah, and more than a foot of snow had fallen across
some higher mountains in Nevada.
   A high wind warning was posted for north-central and
northeastern Arizona, where Show Low reported gusts to 70 mph late
in the morning.
   Snow also spread across Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and New
Mexico.
   In southwestern Wyoming, 5 to 8 inches of snow fell at Evanston
and Kemmerer during the morning, and Lander got 4 inches of snow in
about two hours.
   Ahead of the snow, light showers fell over the southern and
central high Plains.
   Light showers also were scattered from northern Missouri and
southern Iowa to the upper Ohio Valley.
   Snow fell across southern Lower Michigan during the night. Up to
4 inches were reported around Detroit.
   Afternoon temperatures were mostly in the 60s across the
southern Atlantic Coast, the central Gulf Coast states, and from
the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley to the lower
Missouri Valley. Readings were in the 70s across southern Texas and
the Florida Peninsula.
   Lows only in the teens and single digits were reported from the
Dakotas to New England. Below-zero readings were reported in
Michigan and northern Maine.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 below zero at
Warroad, Minn.

<HEAD>Soldiers, Rebels Killed in Fighting; Judges Stage Protest Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas ambushed a military patrol in
an eastern jungle and 15 soldiers and seven rebels were killed in a
dynamite blast and the ensuing battle, an army general said Monday.
   Colombia's judges and judicial employees, meanwhile, declared a
one-day strike to protest the killing last week of a criminal court
justice and her bodyguards, a spokeswoman for the judicial workers'
union said.
   Leftist insurgents belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia Sunday exploded more than 100 pounds of dynamite on a
road as two army trucks carrying 40 soldiers drove by, Gen. Jaime
Neira said in an interview broadcast by the Caracol radio network.
   The attack occurred near San Jose de Ocume, a town 257 miles
east of the capital Bogota.
   The explosion destroyed one of the trucks and killed 13
soldiers. Two more died as they received medical treatment Monday,
Neira said in a telephone interview from his office in
Villavicencio, the eastern city where region's brigade is based.
   He said seven rebels were killed in fighting after the blast.
   The troops had been patroling as part of a government security
plan to try to guarantee peaceful balloting in March 11 legislative
and mayoral elections. Guerrilla groups have threatened to disrupt
the elections.
   ``Despite the ambush, there will not be any problem with
elections in the region,'' Neira said.
   Rebel groups, especially those belonging to the National
Liberation Army, are trying to prevent voting in their areas of
influence through a campaign of kidnappings, assassinations,
ambushes and sabotage.
   The Liberation Army is holding five mayors, two congressmen, a
city councilman and several political organizers. Most were
kidnapped in the country's northeastern region, where support for
the group is strongest.
   Police said that another leftist guerrilla group, the People's
Liberation Army, was responsible for Thursday's killing of the
criminal court judge but did not give further details.
   Judge Carmen Elisa Rosas and her three police bodyguards were
shot to death near Puerto Hugria, a town 304 miles south of Bogota.
   A spokeswoman for the judicial employees' union, Yolanda Parra,
said in a telephone interview that the country's 4,000 judges and
19,000 judicial workers stayed off the job Monday to protest what
they consider a lack of security for judges.
   She said almost all courts were closed and that the union had
called for assemblies in several cities so workers could vote on
whether to extend the strike.
   Since 1981, 225 judges and judicial employees have been
assassinated. Many of the killings have been carried out by drug
traffickers trying to stop criminal cases against them.
   The judicial workers' union said recently that at least 1,300
judges are working under threat of death from drug traffickers and
other criminals.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel declared what it called a ``state of
alert'' Sunday, indicating it may soon renew its bloody war with
the government after suspending attacks six weeks ago.
   The traffickers declared a unilateral cease-fire Jan. 17 in an
effort to persuade President Virgilio Barco to end extraditions of
drug suspects to the United States. But Barco said on Saturday that
he will not change the policy, which began after the August killing
of a leading presidential candidate.

<TEXT>
   About 350 authors, editors, literary agents and
sympathizers staged a noisy sidewalk protest Monday to accuse
Random House of destroying one of its key subsidiaries for
financial reasons.
   ``The bottom line is not the last word,'' read one sign
displayed outside the publishing giant's midtown headquarters,
where a lunchtime crowd had to thread its way past police
barricades.
   The protesters charged that Random House owner Samuel I.
Newhouse had effectively killed the subsidiary, Pantheon Books, by
forcing the resignation Wednesday of its longtime editorial
director, Andre Schiffrin.
   Schiffrin reportedly had refused to cut his staff and the number
of books he planned to publish.
   Five of Pantheon's six senior editors subsequently quit, saying
Pantheon's established role as a publishing house for
unconventional and otherwise little known writers was being ruined
in the name of profits.
   Random House chairman Alberto Vitale said he was ``absolutely
puzzled'' by the reaction to Schiffrin's resignation. He said
Pantheon would have ceased to operate ``a long, long time ago''
without Random House's support.
   ``It's not Random House who is hurting anything,'' Vitale said
in a telephone interview. ``Random House has kept Pantheon going
all these years.''
   He said the editors who have quit have ``in effect abandoned
their authors. ... These people by leaving have hurt Pantheon.''
   One of those editors, Tom Engelhardt, told reporters at the
demonstration that while Pantheon had provided a forum for such
writers since it was acquired by Random House in 1962, ``the real
disaster for us is that the next generation of writers will be
marginalized; they won't have that opportunity.''
   Author Studs Terkel, clutching a plastic coffee cup in the
near-freezing weather, was among a number of Pantheon-published
writers who turned out for the demonstration. Author Kurt Vonnegut,
although not a Pantheon client, said he was taking part out of
sympathy for his colleagues.
   Vonnegut said he feared what was happening to Pantheon was ``of
little general interest to the country,'' but said, ``I'm disturbed
that a great American institution like this should be destroyed.''
   In an unsigned statement handed out at the demonstration, the
organizers said: ``Just as we have protested censorship _ however
rationalized _ by dictators left and right, we protest censorship _
however rationalized _ by corporate fiat.
   ``At a moment in history when intellectual freedom is scoring
stunning victories around the world, it is appalling that a unique
center of American intellectual vitality should be so
thoughtlessly,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Milan Prepares for a Short and Sporty Winter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian designers are predicting a short
winter for next year _ at least where hemlines are concerned.
   Not only is the average skirt a good three inches above the
knee, but the fall-winter 1990-91 ready-to-wear collections being
presented in Milan this week are full of bermudas and short shorts,
items usually reserved for the warmer months.
   What was a daring step in the late 1980s, when for the first
time in 20 years the ``moda Milanese'' hiked hemlines above the
knee, has become a way of life for the fashionable woman in the new
decade.
   Most fashion followers agree the latest Gianni Versace
mini-skirt, which almost reaches the navel, is just too short, but
at the same time Versace is the clearest statement that short
hemlines are here to stay.
   Once women have agreed to bare their thighs it is easy to get
them to wear shorts in the winter too.
   The new winter bermudas and shorts are loose and sporty, usually
in corduroy or light wool jersey worn with dark or printed
stockings and comfortable walking shoes.
   In general the latest ``moda Milanese'' is pert rather than
sexy, with a heavy accent on sportswear.
   Gone are the tailored city suits and elegant coats of past
seasons, to be replaced by sweatsuits, sport jackets, parkas, down
and duffel coats and loads of knitwear from cozy cardigans,
pullovers and sweaterdresses to the brand new all-knit jumpsuit.
   Colors range from the browns and reds of autumn leaves, to the
icy beige, green and blue pastel shades of a winter landscape.
   Three of the designers who showed there new collections here
Monday _ Krizia, Missoni and Byblos _ are longtime experts in the
field of chic sportwear.
   Krizia proposes a soft and casual look. Shoulders are natural,
hemlines brief and waistlines loose.
   Jackets tend to be oversized with huge shawl collars, rounded
hemline and drawstring waist. In the coat department Krizia offers
cozy bathrobe coats with silk cord monk belts.
   For mountain fun or cold city days Krizia offers a series of
quilted items from long down coats and duffel coats to pert quilted
mini-skirts.
   Every season Krizia picks specific motifs to adorn her pullovers
and sweaters. For next winter she steals cherubs from a Renaissance
painting and prints them on her soft cashmere pullovers and short
sweater dresses. White horses and imperial eagles also adorn many
of her outfits.
   To dress up her sporty look Mariuccia Mandelli, the woman behind
the Krizia label, embroiders gold onto lapels, hemlines and cuffs.
   Since last winter, the Italian designers have caught on to the
ecological movement, replacing their once sumptuous furs with
exquisite lookalikes in teddy-bear plush. Thus the Krizia lady can
flaunt her tiger, leopard or brightly dyed beaver knowing its all
innocuous fluff.
   Missoni has been king of Italian knitwear ever since he
presented his reversible knit and quilted jackets in Florence
several decades ago. But his latest collection, entirely dedicated
to the Soviet Union, is one of the best in seasons.
   Beautiful reversible coats and parkas are knitted in patterns of
Russian folk art: the onion towers of Red Square, the quaint houses
of a Russian village, the geometric designs of a carpet.
   These patterns are also used for the knitted jumpsuits and sweat
pants, as well as for the silk evening outfits.
   Later in the day, Keith Varty for Byblos presented his version
of the sporty 1990-91 winter woman.
   True to his British blood, he dresses her in the favorite items
of his native countryside, riding jackets with velvet collars,
riding breeches,and blouses complete with ascot tie. Lace
embroidery adds a feminine touch to the austere look.
   For languid hours by the fire of your favorite ski lodge Varty
offers heavy knit pullovers in ivory-white with large rose
patterns, and cable-knit Irish sweaters.
   Speaking of skiing, Varty's new parka with string-tie and
fur-trimmed hood in icy beige or blue are sure to be a hot item on
the slopes from Aspen to St. Moritz.

   President Bush on Monday offered support for
Argentine President Carlos Menem's austerity campaign and promised
to look for ways to help the inflation-plagued Argentine economy
recover.
   Menem's government announced a series of austerity measures
Sunday to end the hyperinflation that has triggered labor strife,
soaring interest rates, record unemployment and other problems.
   The White House said the Argentine president called Bush last
Thursday to tell him in advance of the steps being taken to shore
up the economy.
   Bush said in a statement Monday that Menem's actions ``indicate
that he clearly is determined to bring about economic recovery in
Argentina.''
   ``The United States encourages him in this effort and in his
support for democracy,'' Bush said. ``We realize, however, that
this process is not easy and respect the efforts that President
Menem is making.
   ``We will be studying closely the reforms he has announced, and
will look for ways to continue helping the Argentine people to
achieve economic recovery and prosperity,'' Bush said.
   Menem took office in July. His government has been beset by
recession, a plunge in the value of the national currency and
inflation exceeding 8,100 percent over the last 12 months.
   His economy minister, Antonio Ernan Gonzalez, said Sunday that
the Menem government would seek to save $2 billion by cutting back
on the state bureaucracy, in part through early retirements and
layoffs.
   Gonzalez said the state also would raise an additional $600
million through a 1.5 percent increase in the tax on capital goods
and an average 5 percent boost in duties on agricultural exports.
   Argentine banks and exchange houses were closed Monday to allow
implementation of the measures aimed at stabilizing the country's
finances.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who leaves Friday on a week-long
mission to South America, will meet with Menem and other officials
during a March 13-14 stop in Argentina.

   The Energy Department plans to build the
supercollider as originally envisioned although it has not
determined how high above $5.9 billion the cost may climb,
Secretary James A. Watkins said Monday.
   Watkins said physics changes in the design could increase the
cost by $1.2 billion, while changes in labor rates could add
another $300 million.
   The cost of supercollider originally was estimated at $4.4
billion, then rose to $5.9 billion.
   The increase, coupled with the lack of a firm figure on the new
estimate, could spell trouble in Congress as supporters seek their
second year of construction funding for would be the world's
largest scientific instrument. It is to be built south of Dallas.
   ``This creates some problems, yes it does. I wish they were able
to give us a definite figure, but we have been through this many
times on other projects,'' said Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman
of the House Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water
development.
   Asked if Congress could reverse last year's commitment to
building the collider, Bevill appeared unsure of the project's fate.
   ``That's always possible,'' he said. ``No, I don't think that's
going to happen. I don't know. I don't know. At this point I don't
know.''
   The collider would be a a 54-mile underground ring where
subatomic particles are hurled against each other to test theories
about the fundamental nature of matter.
   Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, says the collider has no practical
application.
   Watkins said two independent studies to determine the impact of
design changes on the cost of building the particle accelerator
likely would be finished in June, and that the new estimate would
``fall close to $7 to $8 billion.''
   The Bush administration is seeking $318 million for the collider
in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Bevill said having a final
estimate before he seeks an appropriation from the full House could
be critical.
   Watkins told the panel that too great an increase in the cost
could imperil the administration's support for the project.

   Six mushers who spent seven months making
the first dog sled trek to the South Pole in 78 years loaded their

   Because of two-mile-thick ice surrounding Antarctica, the ship
docked two miles from the Soviet science station in Mirnyy, where

trip across the frozen continent Saturday, said spokeswoman
Jennifer Gasperini.
   The team used small boats to ferry sled dogs and supplies to the
ship, she said.
   The team hopes to depart late Tuesday on a 12-day sail to New
Zealand or Australia and a hectic series of homecoming celebrations
that begins March 19 in Sydney, Australia, Gasperini said.
   An audience with French President Francois Mitterrand is set for
March 21 and with President George Bush for March 27.
   Sunday was the first day off the trail in 220 days for the team,
which by reaching the South Pole on Dec. 11 completed the first dog
sled trek since Roald Amundsen arrived there on Dec. 14, 1911.
   Co-leader Will Steger of Minnesota made history four years ago
when he led a similar assault on the North Pole. He said the sound
of people's voices and the taste of cucumber were his biggest
pleasures at the end of the trip.
   Geoff Somers of Britain relished a chair to sit on and a table
to eat at, while Keizo Funatsu of Japan enjoyed the sight of birds
flying and the feel of rock under his feet.
   Qin Dahe of China and Jean-Louis Etienne of France both
appreciated having a warm, dry bed. ``You don't have to work so
hard to go to sleep,'' Etienne said.
   For Soviet polar scientist Victor Boyarsky, to whom the research
stations of Antarctica are a second home, there was someone special
awaiting him in Mirnyy: his wife, Natasha.
   The six were besieged by television cameras even before they
skied to the edge of the continent at sunset Saturday. A French
film crew traveled at their side the last 90 miles.
   Their triumphant finale was followed by a rushed sauna, and the
cameras followed them inside. A dog sled parked in a snow drift
outside the Mirnyy mess hall, lit up by TV lights, provided a
surreal backdrop for interviews that continued non-stop through the
night.
   Boyarsky's reunion hug from his wife and Steger's first words
were carried live to an estimated 150 million people in the Soviet
Union. Funatsu, 33, who became an end-of-the-trail sensation when
he spent Thursday night lost in a blizzard, sent assurances to his
parents in Osaka via a morning news show.
   Between reporters hungry for news and Soviet scientists hungry
for autographs, the mushers captured a brief three-hour nap Sunday
morning, then got back to work.
   Qin, 43, a glaciologist, carefully refrigerated hundreds of snow
samples for dispatch to laboratories in France, the United States
and China. Somers, 40, a veteran guide for the British Antarctic
Survey, unloaded sleds, many of which will be lent to polar museums
in the United States and Britain.

   Twenty-one people, including a lawyer who
worked for the Bush presidential campaign, were chosen prospective
jurors Monday as the selection process began for the Iran-Contra
trial of former National Security Adviser John Poindexter.
   Poindexter is charged with five felony counts _ one of
conspiracy, two of obstructing Congress and two of making false
statements to congressional committees _ in connection with
accusations that he covered up Oliver North's secret Contra
resupply network and lied about a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to
Iran.
   He is the highest-ranking Reagan administration official to go
on trial in the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene disqualified one woman who
expressed uncertainty when asked whether she could be fair and
impartial. The judge also disqualified an equipment operator who
said that ``when the whole thing was going down'' following public
disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair ``all you heard was North and
Poindexter.'' Seventeen of the first 21 in the pool were women.
   Two hundred six people have filled out questionnaires to be
possible jurors for the trial, and 76 of them have said they had
heard, watched or read portions of congressional testimony
Poindexter gave in 1987 under a grant of immunity from prosecution
based on what he said.
   The judge approved for the jury pool a real estate lawyer who
worked in President Bush's campaign as part of a group doing
background reviews of potential vice presidential candidates. Bush
was President Reagan's vice president at the time.
   The woman also said one of Poindexter's defense lawyers, Joseph
Small, had babysat for her when she was a child.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb questioned whether she should be
in the jury pool since she knew one of the defense lawyers.
   ``Just because counsel babysat for her doesn't cast any doubt on
her,'' said Greene.
   The woman also said a brother-in-law has worked for former
Virginia Govs. Charles Robb and Gerald Baliles, both Democrats.
Robb is now a U.S. senator.
   Also accepted for the jury pool: a clerical worker who said
under questioning that she knew former Poindexter aide North ``was
on trial'' in the past and that he had been fined and was
performing community service.
   ``It was a big to-do in D.C.,'' said the woman.
   A jury of 12 people and six alternates will be selected from a
pool of residents from the District of Columbia. Greene is expected
to build a pool of several dozen prospective jurors from which to
select a jury.
   Most of those questioned said they knew little about the
Iran-Contra affair.
   A retired cook who said she had worked for seven lawers in the
1950s said she had heard nothing of Poindexter's or North's
testimony to Congress. She said she was unaware of Reagan's
videotaped testimony taken Feb. 16-17 and publicized extensively in
the past week and a half.
   Poindexter's lawyers are expected to replay Reagan's videotaped
testimony in court.
   Several people said they would give the same weight to Reagan's
testimony that they would to anyone else who might testify in the
case.
   Poindexter lawyer Richard Beckler started off the questioning by
asking the first pospective juror what she thought of Reagan.
   The young woman, an unemployed delivery driver for an auto parts
firm, wasn't given a chance to answer. Webb objected to Beckler's
question, without giving a reason, and Greene sustained the
objection.
   The others sent to the jury pool were a data processing employee
who works two jobs, a nursing assistant and a janitor at a National
Guard armory.
   Each of the charges against Poindexter carries a maximum
five-year prison term and $250,000 fine on conviction.

   Security troopers fired into a rioting
mob Monday at Bandipur, killing two people, a news agency reported,
and Moslem militants ambushed a patrol during a curfew relaxation
in Srinagar.
   Militants claimed they killed 12 members of the Border Security
Force in the ambush, but an official spokesman in New Delhi said
two soldiers were wounded and a civilian was killed when the
troopers returned fire.
   At least 166 people have been killed since a crackdown began
Jan. 20 on Moslem militants who seek to make Jammu-Kashmir state
either independent or a part of neighboring Pakistan. United News
of India reported the shooting in Bandipur.
   Three government officials visited Srinagar on Monday. A
government spokesman in New Delhi, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said Cabinet Secretary V.C. Pande, Defense
Secretary Naresh Chandra and Home Secretary Shiromani Sharma made
``an on-the-spot review of the situation.''
   They reported to the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs,
which includes Prime Minister V.P. Singh, Home Minister Mufti
Mohamed Sayeed and other top government ministers.
   The spokesman did not reveal details of the meeting, but said
the three officials conferred with ranking civilian and military
officers in Srinagar.
   Kashmir has been an issue between India, which is predominantly
Hindu, and Pakistan, an officially Moslem nation, since they were
formed in 1947 and gained independence from Britain.
   Srinagar and the surrounding Kashmir Valley became part of
Jammu-Kashmir, while western Kashmir was attached to Pakistan.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence, two
of them over Kashmir.
   A paramilitary officer said the ambush was among the boldest and
best organized ever carried out in Srinagar, center of the Moslem
separatist movement.
   He said the ambushers fired at least 100 rounds from three
directions with automatic weapons at 7:30 a.m., on the main
shopping street in central Srinagar. The officer spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Authorities lifted the curfew, which had been in effect since 4
a.m. Friday, from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. so thousands of stranded
villagers could return home.
   The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front claimed responsibility for
the attack, describing it as revenge for the killing of 49 Moslem
demonstrators by army and paramilitary troopers last Thursday.
   ``We have killed 12 Indian soldiers,'' an anonymous telephone
caller told a Srinagar journalist. ``We carried out the operation
this morning to take revenge for the deaths of our Moslem brothers
who were killed by the army.''
   On Thursday, an estimated 1 million people marched through
Srinagar in support of the secessionist movement. It was the
largest pro-independence demonstration ever held in the Kashmir
Valley.
   At least 49 people were reported killed when soldiers opened
fire on groups of people returning home from the march.
   The government said they fired in self-defense. Witnesses said
some demonstrators tried to grab the weapons of soldiers and police.

<HEAD>U.S. Calls for Investigation of Suspected Invasion Tunnels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.-led United Nations Command on
Monday called for a joint investigation of an ``invasion tunnel''
allegedly dug by Communist North Korea across its border into South
Korea.
   The United Nations Command, which polices the border zone formed
by the 1953 Korean cease-fire, said in a letter to North Korea,
``We have evidence of another tunnel under the Demilitarized Zone,
which is an extremely serious violation of the Armistice Agreement.
   U.S. Rear Adm. Larry G. Vogt said in the letter that, ``All the
evidence gathered thus far by our multinational special
investigation team indicates the tunnel began inside your side of
the DMZ, and extends over a thousand meters (1,000 yards) into our
portion of the DMZ.
   ``Such a tunnel could be used by military forces and represents
a flagrant violation of the Armistice Agreement,'' he added.
   Vogt proposed that a joint observer team of the two sides meet
Tuesday to investigate the tunnel.
   There was no immediate response from North Korea, which has
denied digging the tunnel.
   The tunnel, discovered Saturday in the eastern sector of the 155
mile-long border, was the fourth tunnel discovered since 1974.
Pyongyang has denied digging the other three tunnels.
   The latest tunnel discovered is two yards wide by two yards high
and about 2,030 yards long. It crosses about 1,000 yards into the
southern sector of the DMZ.
   The United Nations Command, formed during the three-year Korean
War to help South Korea repel the North Korean invasion of 1950,
said it would formally protest the existence of the tunnel.
   Earlier Monday, South Korea's Unification Board said in a
statement that the tunnel ``is proof that North Korea has not given
up its policy of communizing the South.''
   The Defense Ministry said a South Korean searching party was
moving cautiously through the tunnel after a land mine exploded
Sunday, killing a patrol dog.
   South Korean officials said North Korea broadcasted messages
through loudspeakers along the border saying ``Don't look for
tunnels that do not exist,'' and ``Don't revive worn-out talk about
underground tunnels.''
   The United Nations Command said in a statement that it suspects
that another 20 tunnels exist along the frontline.

<HEAD>Izvestia Prints Draft of Gorbachev Proposal on Presidency</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Elections, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens saw an official draft of Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's proposal for a vastly more powerful presidency
Monday, a week before the Congress of People's Deputies considers
it.
   As printed in Izvestia, the government newspaper, the proposed
constitutional amendments closely resemble the version leaked last
Tuesday, when Gorbachev pushed the plan through the Supreme Soviet.
   The amendments now must be approved by the legislature's parent
body, the 2,250-member Congress, which will hold a special session
next Monday.
   According to the draft in Izvestia, the new president:
   _Must be at least 35 years old and not more than 65.
   _Will be elected for five years and cannot serve more than two
terms.
   _Can veto laws passed by the Supreme Soviet. If the Supreme
Soviet overrides his veto with a two-thirds vote, he can bring the
measure before the full Congress of People's Deputies.
   _Is commander in chief of the armed forces.
   _Appoints the premier and other top government officers, subject
to confirmation by the Congress of People's Deputies.
   _Can block decrees by the Council of Ministers.
   _Has the power to declare a general or partial mobilization, or
``declare a state of war in the event of an attack and promptly
bring the question before the Supreme Soviet.''
   _ Can declare, ``in the interest of the defense of the U.S.S.R.
and security of its citizens, a state of martial law or emergency
in specific places. ... He can, in these cases, introduce temporary
presidential rule. _Issues decrees that ``have obligatory force in
the entire territory of the country.''
   _Is chosen in a nationwide general election. The jurist who
presented the bill to the Supreme Soviet, however, said the first
president would be elected by the Congress to a four-year term
because organizing a general election would take too long.
   Gorbachev's proposal has inspired complaints from the
opposition, who say the president will have dictatorial powers.
Pro-independence groups in the Baltic republics and elsewhere fear
Gorbachev will use the new powers to crush their movements and
their plans for secession.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Will Invalidate Most N.C. Death Sentences</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court overturned a key portion of
North Carolina's death penalty law Monday in a ruling that will
invalidate the sentences of most of the 85 death row inmates in
that state.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court set aside a murderer's death sentence
because his sentencing jury was told not to consider any factor
suggesting a lesser sentence unless all 12 jurors could agree on
that factor.
   The decision probably will not affect any death row inmate
outside North Carolina.
   ``The system that was condemned is the system we've been using
since 1977 for sentencing people to death,'' said Raleigh lawyer
Malcolm Hunter Jr., who successfully challenged the North Carolina
law. He said Monday's ruling ``could have a very broad impact''
within the state.
   A spokesman for North Carolina Attorney General Lacy Thornburg
said as many as 70 death row inmates now must receive new
sentencing trials.
   In a separate decision, the court gave judges and prosecutors
leeway in what they tell jurors choosing life or death for
murderers, voting 5-4 to uphold a California man's death sentence.
   And in a third death-penalty ruling, the justices split 5-4 in
ruling that an Oklahoma murderer is procedurally barred from
contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore ``sympathy''
before it sentenced him to death.
   The rulings in the California and Oklahoma cases are not likely
to affect many of the some 2,200 death row inmates across the
nation.
   In other matters Monday, the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether Louisiana officials are violating an
insane death row inmate's rights by forcing him to take
mind-altering drugs in an effort to make him sane enough so he be
executed.
   _Cut back severely the right of criminal defendants to attack
their prosecutions on constitutional grounds after an initial set
of appeals in state courts. The 5-4 ruling upheld a South Carolina
murderer's death sentence.
   _Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a Michigan case, that even when police
questioning violates a criminal defendant's right to legal help the
responses may be used to contradict his trial testimony.
   In the North Carolina death penalty case, the court set aside
the death sentence of Dock McKoy Jr., convicted of the 1984
shooting death of Anson County Deputy Sheriff William Kress Horne.
   Relying on their 1988 decision in a Maryland case, the justices
said the jury that sentenced McKoy wrongly was limited in its
consideration of ``mitigating evidence.'' Jurors were told they had
to unanimously agree on the existence of each mitigating factor.
   The requirement of unanimity was laid down in 1985, and the
attorney general's office believes Monday's ruling will affect only
defendants sentecned after that said Jim Coman, senior deputy
attorney general. ``But I'm sure all the attorneys for all the
death row inmates will appeal.''
   Writing for the court, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
unanimity requirement is unconstitutional.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.
   The court upheld the California death sentence of Richard Boyde,
who was convicted of the 1981 murder of Dick Gibson, a Riverside
convenience store clerk.
   Boyde's sentencing jury was read a list of specific mitigating
factors it could consider in choosing his punishment. Jurors also
were told they could consider ``any other circumstance which
extenuates the gravity of the crime.'' California courts no longer
use that instruction.
   Rehnquist, writing for the court, rejected arguments by Boyde's
lawyers that the instruction prevented jurors from considering
factors regarding his background and character that might be deemed
mitigating even if they did not lessen the crime's gravity.
   Justices Marshall, William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun and
John Paul Stevens dissented.
   In the Oklahoma case, the court never reached the merits of
death row inmate Robyn Leroy Parks' challenge of an
``anti-sympathy'' instruction his sentencing jury received.
   Instead, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court that
Parks was procedurally barred from raising that argument after
having exhausted his direct appeals in state courts.
   Parks was convicted of the 1977 killing of Abdullah Ibrahim, a
gas station attendant in Oklahoma City.
   The presiding judge told jurors, ``You must avoid any influence
of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice or other arbitrary
factor when imposing sentence.''
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the
instruction undermined the jury's consideration of mitigating
evidence but that ruling was overturned.
   Kennedy was joined by Rehnquist, White, O'Connor and Scalia.

   A 17-year-old Chicago youth won a $20,000
college scholarship Monday night for a project on molecular
genetics that he believes may advance understanding of the
conversion of nitrogen from air into ammonia.
   Matthew Peter Headrick won first place in the Westinghouse
Science Talent Search, the nation's oldest high school science
competition.
   His selection was announced at an awards banquet attended by
more than 500 leaders from science, government, education and
business.
   Headrick is a senior at the University of Chicago Laboratory
Schools High School and plans to study at Princeton or Stanford
universities for a career in physics or biophysics.
   The next two top winners were David Ruchien Liu, 16, of
Riverside, Calif., who entered a neuroscience project, and David
Michael Shull, 17, of Tacoma, Wash., who developed a method of
placing the genetic coding for production of a molecule into white
blood cells. They each received $15,000 awards.
   The prestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search, an annual
competition established in 1942, started last September when 1,431
students entered from 36 states. The list was cut to 300 by a board
of eight scientists from a variety of fields.
   Forty finalists received a five-day trip to Washington, where
they underwent additional judging to determine their scientific
creativity and potential.
   Of the 1,960 winners in the Search since its inception, five
have gone on to win Nobel Prizes; two have won Field Medals for
distinguished work in mathematics and eight have been awarded
MacArthur Foundation Fellowships for research in the physical and
life sciences.
   For his winning project, Headrick used molecular genetics
techniques to isolate for the first time the gene that is necessary
for nitrogen fixation in a fresh water blue-green alga. Nitrogen
fixation, the conversion of molecular nitrogen from air into
nitrogen-carrying chemical compounds that plants can use, is
essential for the synthesis of amino acids and for all life. The
alga in question converts the nitrogen to ammonia.
   Search officials said that Headrick ``believes his work will
help toward a better understanding of the nitrogen fixation systems
and the process of cellular differentiation.''
   The fourth through 10th place winners and scholarship amounts
were:
   _Soojin Ryu, 18, Bronx, N.Y., $10,000;
   _Joshua Fischman, 17, Bethesda, Md., $10,000;
   _Royce Yung-Tze Peng, 17, Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., $10,000;
   _Laura Andrea Ascenzi, 17, Sunnyside, N.Y., $7,500;
   _Andrew M. Lines, 17, Arlington, Va., $7,500;
   _Mina Kim Yu, 17, of Fairfax, Va., $7,500;
   _Bianca Denise Santomasso, 17, New York City, $7,500.
   Selected as first and second alternates were Jennifer Lynn
Ryder, 17, Fresno, Calif. and Sean Eric McGuire, 18, San Antonio,
Texas. The alternates and the 28 other national finalists were
awarded $1,000 scholarships making the total value of the awards
$140,000.

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on
Monday defended the violent suppression of student protests that
have forced him to review economic austerity measures.
   The Ivorian leader, speaking at his first news conference since
1985, suggested multinational companies were trying to destabilize
Africa to obtain the lowest possible price for its raw materials.
   Houphouet-Boigny, 84, denied protesters' claims that he had
siphoned millions of dollars from state coffers.
   ``If you think I have that kind of money, do you think I would
leave my people in that situation?'' he told a reporter who asked
whether he would use his ``immense fortune'' to help Ivorians
suffering the worst economic crisis in the country's history.
   Hundreds of government and other workers joined protesting
students Friday in demonstrations in Abidjan and chanted:
``Houphouet: thief. Houphouet corrupt.''
   Abidjan was calm Monday although dozens of armed soldiers were
deployed and presidential guards in red berets blocked off the
presidential office in the city center.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, has
condemned ``severe beatings'' by soldiers and police who have fired
tear gas and stun grenades to halt protests. Many demonstrations
have been peaceful and some have been violent protests in which
people have burned and stoned cars and ransacked several stores.
   ``If I have to choose between disorder and injustice I will
choose injustice because there will be time to redress that,''
Houphouet-Boigny said.
   He noted that no one has been killed in the protests.
   The president repeated his opposition to protesters' demands for
a multiparty democracy, saying parties in Africa tend to be drawn
along tribal lines, promoting ethnic rivalry and endangering
national unity.
   ``When everything has been debated, and we deliberate on
everything, the decision always rests with one person: me,''
Houphouet-Boigny said.
   His critics say Houphouet-Boigny made a fortune from shares in
companies that buy cocoa and coffee, the main Ivorian exports, when
commodity prices were high in the 1960s and 1970s and farmers were
poorly paid.
   Slumping prices of raw materials have caused Ivory Coast's
economic crisis and led to protests, which began Feb. 19 with
demands the president resign. He has ruled since the country became
independent from France in 1960.
   Houphouet-Boigny confirmed Monday that his government will
reduce other expenses of Ivorians to offset proposed pay cuts of
between 15 percent and 40 percent for civil servants and increase a
pay tax on private-sector workers from 1 percent to 11 percent.
   ``We are going to ask for sacrifices, but at the same time we
are going to cut rents, water, electricity, clothing and food
costs,'' he said.
   Houphouet-Boigny also appealed to developed nations to set ``a
just price'' for Africa's raw materials.
   Cocoa and coffee prices have surged on exchanges in New York and
London amid dealers' concerns that the protests could interfere
with delivery of Ivory Coast's 800,000-ton crop. The Ivorian crop _
a third of world supplies _ has mostly been sold and awaits
shipping at Abidjan docks.
   In October, Houphouet-Boigny was forced to halve prices paid to
farmers for coffee and cocoa.
   He noted coffee producers in Ivory Coast now get 16 cents a
pound, which produces 22 cups of coffee sold in moderate-priced
European restaurants for up to $3.50 a cup.
   ``We are now back in a situation of forced labor, except the
label has changed,'' he said.
   He accused multinational companies of ``being at the root of
Africa's political problems.''
   ``I have the feeling that someone is proceeding to destabilize''
African countries, he said.

   Hank Gathers, the college basketball star who
collapsed in the heat of competition and died, was mourned Monday
as an inspiration on and off the court by teammates and his coach,
who said, ``Whatever we were, we were Hank's team.''
   Gathers, 23, a fifth-year senior and center for the Loyola
Marymount University Lions, crumpled Sunday night soon after
sinking a thunderous slam dunk in the first half of a tournament
game against the University of Portland (Ore.).
   ``We called him `Bank man' because we went to him for
everything,'' said Coach Paul Westhead. ``We went to him for
rebounds, we went to him for points, we went to him for life.
   ``He was a walking thunderbolt.''
   Gathers, who was considered a certain pick in the first round of
the National Basketball Association draft, was pronounced dead at
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital.
   Autopsy results were unavailable Monday, but doctors said he'd
been treated after a similar collapse in December for an irregular
heart rhythm.
   Gathers, a 6-foot-7, 210-pound center from Philadelphia, became
the second player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in
scoring (32.7 average) and rebounding (13.7 average) last year. The
feat was first accomplished by Wichita State's Xavier McDaniel five
years ago.
   Gathers also was 11th on the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Division I single-season scoring list, with 1,015
points last season.
   After the first collapse, he missed two games, but began taking
medication and was cleared to play again. Gathers persuaded doctors
to cut back on his medication, and said he felt himself
strengthening.
   Teammate Jeff Fryer said Monday that Gathers had done something
unusual before the game that turned out to be his last. He ran on
the track to warm up rather than jumping rope as usual.
   ``We thought he was crazy,'' Fryer said, adding, ``That was
Hank.''
   Just 6{ minutes into the West Coast Conference tournament game,
Gathers slam-dunked for his eighth point, giving 22nd-ranked Loyola
Marymount a 25-13 lead over Portland.
   He was heading back to his regular spot in the Lions' press when
he dropped to the floor.
   Loyola doctors rushed onto the court. After a few moments,
Gathers tried to get up, struggling to his knees. But then he began
to suffer what appeared to be a seizure.
   His mother, Lucille, ran onto the court, followed by his aunt,
Carole Livingston. Their screams and cries rang through Albert
Gersten Pavilion as a stunned crowd of about 3,000 watched in
silence.
   The tournament was canceled and Loyola Marymount, a Los Angeles
school, was declared the league champion by virtue of its 13-1
regular-season record in conference games.
   Gathers' death prompted CBS to postpone a scheduled broadcast of
``Malcolm Takes a Shot,'' a drama for children about a high school
basketball star stricken with an epileptic seizure in the final
seconds of a game.
   Teammates and coach had trouble talking about Gathers at a news
conference Monday.
   ``Hank represents the little kid in all of us because to Hank
Gathers basketball was play, and we all want to play,'' Westhead
said. ``Basketball was free play, and Hank Gathers was the best in
playing freely.''
   Longtime friend and teammate Bo Kimble came West with Gathers
after graduating from Dobbins Tech in Philadelphia in 1985. The
pair went to the University of Southern California for a year, then
transferred to Loyola Marymount, where they were the main
ingredients in college basketball's highest-scoring team the last
three seasons.
   Trying to share his memories with reporters, Kimble was overcome
by emotion and had to be helped from the podium. Later, he was able
to summon a smile when asked about the team's berth in the NCAA
tournament.
   ``Oh yes, definitely, I'm sure we're going to play. We can turn
a negative thing into a positive thing,'' said Kimble, the nation's
leading scorer, an honor earned by Gathers last season.
   ``We're going to be up for the challenge, we're going to
dedicate this to Hank.''

<HEAD>Widow of Allende Moves Back to Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of former President Salvador
Allende returned for good to her homeland Monday and said she would
attend the weekend ceremony in which Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who led
the coup that toppled her husband's government, gives up power.
   ``I want to spend my last years here,'' Hortensia Bussi de
Allende, 75, told reporters at Santiago's international airport.
She arrived from Mexico, where she lived for more than a decade in
exile.
   She was met by Socialist Party officials and by a daughter,
Isabel, and granddaughter, Marcia. A small crowd cheered her
arrival, which was virtually unpublicized.
   Mrs. Allende said she would attend Sunday's inaugural ceremony,
in which Pinochet hands over the presidency to an elected
successor, Patricio Aylwin, in the port city of Valparaiso.
   Asked if she planned to participate in the new government, she
replied: ``No. I've always said we have to make way for the younger
people.''
   Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, is backed by a coalition of 17
centrist and leftist parties, including the Socialist Party that
Allende once led.
   Mrs. Allende said she would lobby to have her husband's remains
moved to ``a deserved spot in Santiago, where everyone can pay him
homage, and to have a grand monument built.''
   Allende died in the presidential palace while it was being
bombarded by the military during a coup on Sept. 11, 1973.
According to witnesses, he committed suicide with a machine gun
when it became evident his leftist government was falling.
   He was buried in the unpretentious plot of a brother-in-law, in
the coastal resort of Vina del Mar, near Valparaiso. The military
kept the grave unmarked for many years.
   The military forced Mrs. Allende to leave the country within
days of the coup.
   She first returned in late 1988 after Pinochet, campaigning for
an eight-year extension of his rule, ordered an end to her exile
and that of hundreds of other dissidents. Voters in an October 1988
referendum rejected the extension for Pinochet, forcing him to call
elections.

   The government said Monday it would pay
interim compensation of $12 per month to each of 500,000 people
living near the site of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
   ``The government has been deeply concerned about the continuing
miseries of hundreds of thousands of people of Bhopal who were
affected by this gas leak disaster,'' said Petroleum and Chemicals
Minister M.S. Gurupadaswamy.
   ``The disbursement of final compensation may take considerable
time and the victims, who have suffered for over five years, cannot
be asked to wait any longer,'' he said.
   The leak of toxic gas from the pesticide plant operated by Union
Carbide Corp. in December 1984 killed at least 3,598 people and
injured another 20,000 in the world's worst industrial disaster.
   The announcement Monday said all the people living in the
vicinity of the pesticide plant at the time of the leak, including
minors, would be paid interim compensation, pending the outcome of
legal battles with Union Carbide, a U.S.-based multinational.
   The payments would run for at least three years, it said, so
that victims ``may continue to get regular assistance over a period
of time and this may help them in meeting their medical expenses
and earning of basic livelihood on a continuous basis.''
   ``This decision, to cover all the residents, has been taken
because we feel that all those people who were exposed to the gas
have suffered, even though some of the health effects may show up
(only) in the long run,'' Gurupadaswamy said.
   The payments, he said, will be adjusted against any final
compensation arrived at.
   The government said in January it will challenge a $470 million
settlement agreed to last year by Union Carbide and the previous
government. Arguments in the case are continuing in the Supreme
Court and it unlikely a quick decision will be reached.
   According to the 1989-90 Stateman's Yearbook, the average per
capita income in India is $270 a year, citing the latest available
figures from 1986.

   A state policeman was killed and two other
members of a drug-fighting task force were gunned down Monday
afternoon while trying buy cocaine in an undercover operation,
authorities said.
   Police said the sellers tried to rob the officers, setting off a
firefight. Two men were arrested, one of whom was wounded. Police
sought a third man who may have been involved.
   The shootings took place about 3:30 p.m. in the Jacob Riis
housing projects on the city's Lower East Side, when the officers
arrived to meet people from whom they had agreed to buy nearly 4{
pounds of cocaine, said police Commissioner Lee Brown.
   According to Brown, an officer entered a building with one of
the sellers and was confronted by another inside. They struggled,
and as other officers came to help, the gunfight broke out.
   ``Our preliminary information is the perpetrators were going to
rob the officers,'' Brown said. ``We don't know if they knew the
undercover officers were police.''
   No drugs were found, but the $42,000 the officers brought to
make the purchase was recovered.
   State police Investigator Joseph T. Aversa, 31, was killed said
Lt. Ronald Clark, a spokesman at state police headquarters in
Albany.
   Aversa, shot in the left eye, died at Bellevue Hospital, and two
New York City detectives who were shot in the leg were in stable
condition there, officials said.
   The arrested man also was treated at Bellevue.
   The officers were members of a drug enforcement task force which
includes city, state and federal officers.
   Deputy Inspector Mike Julian said the undercover officers
arrived in what is called a ``flash car'' _ a black Pontiac Formula
350 with tinted windows _ to show drug dealers that they had the
money.
   No drugs were found after the shooting, but the $42,000 the
officers brought to make the purchase was recovered.
   Mayor David Dinkins went to the hospital. ``This is further
evidence of the fact that our police officers, women and men, put
their lives on the line for us everyday,'' he said.
   James Brown, a resident of the building, said that from his
14th-floor window he saw two men run from the building, then open
fire on officers who tried to cut them off.
   ``It was really scary,'' said Brown, who estimated 15 shots were
fired during the five-minute battle.
   ``It was chaotic. People were screaming. Civilians were running
all over the place,'' said paramedic Lt. Carlos Ariza.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Calls for High-Level Warsaw Pact Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier
on Monday invited his counterparts from other Warsaw Pact countries
for a March 17 meeting on the unification of Germany.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky said letters of
invitation were sent Monday, and the meeting has the backing of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``We also know the response of the GDR to have this meeting in
Prague is favorable,'' Jan Martinek, a foreign ministry official,
told The Associated Press, using the acronymn for East Germany's
formal name.
   Dienstbier welcomed the idea of a unified Germany, but
reiterated Czechoslovakia supports Poland's demands to participate
in reunification talks involving the German states and the Allied
powers, which divided Germany after World War II.
   Poland insists on West German guarantees that the Polish-German
border is inviolable _ a guarantee that West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has been reluctant to provide.
   ``Germans should realize they owe their unification also to
Polish Solidarity and the democratization processes in Eastern
Europe,'' Dienstbier said, noting that only three months ago the
idea of uniting the Germanys was not expected in this century.
   ``We have bitter experience with events such as the Munich Pact,
when borders of one country were determined by others,'' Dienstbier
told the Czech parliament earlier Monday.
   He was referring to the 1938 Munich conference involving
Germany, Britain, France and Italy. It gave Czechoslovakia's border
region known as the Sudeten to the Nazis.
   Dienstbier also said that Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, will be
the site of a planned April 9 meeting among the presidents of
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, as well as their premiers and
foreign ministers.
   Dobrovsky said the invitations are a ``practical
implementation'' of a proposal made by Czechoslovak President
Vaclav Havel to his Hungarian and Polish counterparts. He said the
foreign ministers of Yugoslavia, Italy and Austria also will be
invited.
   He said the one-day meeting's main purpose would be
``brainstorming.''
   ``There will be no creation of new blocs or structures. It
should be a discussion about various issues related to these
countries,'' Dobrovsky said.

<TEXT>
   A shopping mall pledged to hire more
blacks and discontinue its practice of detaining black teen-agers
under a 1960s trespass law in an agreement with the NAACP,
officials said Monday.
   The civil rights group's national chairman, William F. Gibson of
Greenville, said the pact with the 128-store Columbia Mall was the
first of its kind, and encouraged other NAACP chapters ``to
negotiate similar agreements.''
   The Baltimore-based National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People had planned to boycott the mall if no agreement was
reached, Gibson said.
   George Forbes, an attorney for mall owner Jacobs, Visconi and
Jacobs of Cleveland, said the agreement was reached in a ``spirit
of cooperation'' but is not legally binding.
   ``The Columbia Mall does not, it has not and it will not
discriminate as regards to race, creed or color,'' said Forbes, a
longtime member of the NAACP. ``There seemed to be an indication
that we have done that, and I consistently said that we have not,
and anyone at the mall found to be involved with that would be
immediately dismissed.''
   The agreement, negotiated over the last month by NAACP and mall
officials, calls for hiring and promoting more blacks by mall
management and encouraging stores to do the same, and for using
more black contractors and suppliers.
   However, the pact does not specify the number of jobs or work
contracts the mall will give to blacks.
   The mall's owners also offered to sponsor a jobs fair, create an
employment center, advertise in the black media, provide
sensitivity training for employees, and work with the NAACP to
closely monitor the mall's relationship with the black community.
   Informal studies show blacks comprise 30 percent to 40 percent
of the mall's 150,000 weekly customers, Gibson said.
   About a month ago, the mall discontinued its practice of
detaining black youths under a 1960s anti-trespassing law designed
to maintain segregation, Jacobs said.
   Minority groups alleged last summer that about 50 black
teen-agers had been detained by mall security officers under the
trespass law. The youths were photographed, their names placed in
security files, and many were told not to return for six months. In
most cases, no criminal charges were ever filed.
   In December, two black teen-agers were shot inside the mall in
the latest of four such incidents.
   In an interview afterwards, Richland County Sheriff Allen Sloan
was quoted by a newspaper as saying the best way to reduce mall
violence was to ``keep the niggers out.'' Sloan denied making the
statement.
   Forbes said the mall owner is committed to minority hiring. He
said one of the four administrators is black and that blacks
comprised 35 percent of the security force.
   ``We think that is not only good sense, but it makes good
business,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush marked the 20th anniversary
Monday of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by calling on all
holdout nations to sign the pact.
   He urged the 140 signatory nations and the rest of the world to
work together ``even more dilligently to prevent nuclear
proliferation, which possess one of the greatest risks to the
survival of mankind.''
   Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are Israel, South Africa,
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
   North Korea technically has signed up, but Bush administration
officials say it has failed to accept international safeguards on
its atomic energy program.
   Still, Bush called the treaty ``the most widely accepted arms
control instrument in history.''
   At a time of ``major progress in arms control,'' Bush urged
``all states that are not party to the (treaty) to join and thereby
demonstrate their support for the goal of preventing nuclear
proliferation.''
   In addition to furthering arms control, the treaty has also
fostered international cooperation on the peaceful uses of atomic
energy under safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, Bush said.
   The 140 signatory nations will convene a fourth review
conference on the treaty later this year.

<TEXT>
   China has agreed to resume participation in the
Fulbright program but on a smaller scale than in recent years, the
U.S. Embassy said Monday.
   Chinese education officials agreed to send 16 Chinese scholars
and students to the United States next fall to do research, and
accept 16 U.S. professors to teach, said embassy spokesman Sheridan
W. Bell. He said the embassy was still waiting a letter from the
Chinese government to formalize the agreement.
   China took part in the U.S. scholarly exchange program for a
decade, with 24 scholars traveling in each direction in recent
years.
   It abruptly canceled the 1989-90 academic year exchanges in
August in anger over U.S. criticism of the army's killing of
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   Talks on resuming the exchanges began in December, after U.S.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft mae a fence-mending visit
to Beijing.
   The reduction in the number of scholars exchanges means fewer
academic fields will be represented, Bell said, but he did not know
which fields the Chinese had cut. Since June, Chinese authorities
have stressed the need to learn from the West in technical areas,
but have said fewer students in the social sciences will be sent
abroad.
   Resumption of the Fulbrights does not indicate that a complete
healing of U.S.-China relations, deeply shaken by the June
killings, is likely in the near future. That will not be possible
as long as the U.S. Embassy shelters two fugitive Chinese
dissidents, Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian.
   China has demanded the two surrender and face charges of
counter-revolutionary crimes, and shows no sign of softening that
stance.
   A range of people-to-people contacts are resuming slowly,
however. Last week, four non-official U.S. delegations passed
through Beijing _ one to join in climbing Mount Everest, and the
others to hold talks on trade or political relations.

   A man accused of sending threatening letters
to ``Remington Steele'' star Stephanie Zimbalist was arrested in a
hotel, the FBI said Monday.
   Michael Lawrence Shields, 43, of Plymouth, Mich., was arrested
Friday at the Valley Hilton in the suburban Sherman Oaks area after
allegedly sending 212 letters to the 33-year-old actress, most of
them threatening, authorities said.
   FBI agents found Shields because his last letter to the actress
said he would be coming to Southern California, giving his flight
number and the name of the hotel, said FBI Agent Lawrence Lawler.
   Miss Zimbalist played sleuth Laura Holt on NBC's ``Remington
Steele,'' which ran from 1982 through 1986. Her father is actor
Efrem Zimbalist Jr., who played an inspector on the drama series
``The FBI.''
   The arrest of Shields marked the latest in a series of cases in
which fans are alleged to have threatened celebrities through the
mail.
   In December, a shipping clerk accused of sending nearly 6,000
threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox pleaded guilty to three
felony counts and was sentenced to three years probation.

   A New York-bound USAir DC-9 made an
emergency landing shortly after takeoff Monday when a couple who
missed the flight allegedy warned there was a bomb on board in
their luggage, the airline said.
   No explosive device was found on the plane, which was carrying
14 passengers and a crew of five, authorities said.
   Flight 195 was on the runway at Norfolk International Airport
preparing for takeoff when a couple showed up at the boarding gate
and demanded to board the plane, USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said
in Arlington.
   When the couple was told the plane was preparing to take off and
could not return, ``they made remarks to the effect that `You'll
bring it back,' and some comments about a bomb in their luggage,''
Ms. Young said.
   The plane turned back and landed 20 minutes after takeoff. A
search by the state police and FBI failed to turn up anything
suspicious, and the flight arrived in New York three hours behind
schedule.
   ``It's my understanding that one piece of baggage has been
separated from the rest,'' said Wayne Shank, the airport's deputy
executive director.
   Shanks said the plane was moved to a remote section of the field
and the passengers taken off while the plane was searched.
   Ms. Young said the couple, who were not identified, were turned
over to the police.

   Theologians expressed surprise Monday about
Cardinal John O'Connor's disclosure that the rare rite of exorcism
has been performed twice in New York in a year.
   But other ceremonies dealing with evil spirits, including a
baptismal prayer, are more common in the Roman Catholic Church.
   O'Connor mentioned the exorcisms during a sermon Sunday and to
reporters afterward. He said heavy-metal music spiked with satanic
lyrics created an atmosphere conducive to devil-worship and demonic
possession.
   The cardinal said the exorcisms were approved by the
archdiocese's vicar general and appeared to be successful, but gave
no other details. He also said the novel, ``The Exorcist,'' is a
``gruesomely authentic'' portrayal of demonic possession.
   According to a story published Dec. 12 in the San Francisco
Chronicle, Pope John Paul II recently increased the number of
exorcists in Rome and in Turin, where there are a reported 40,000
devil worshipers.
   Last week, police in Indianapolis asked an unidentified priest
to pray and sprinkle holy water in a house after they saw a radio,
a vase and other objects inexplicably move. They had been called to
investigate a possible burglary after the resident came home and
found smashed dishes, windows, a lamp and eggs. A 14-year-old
relative who had been staying there was believed to have been
involved in devil worship, authorities said.
   The Rev. Simon Harak, a theology professor at Fairfield
University in Connecticut, said that exorcism, recognized in the
church's book of rituals, is performed for people under the highest
form of attack by an evil spirit _ people ``who are no longer in
charge of their own will.''
   Exorcisms are confidential; no figures are kept on the number
performed in the United States, said Bill Ryan, spokesman for the
U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington, D.C.
   But channeling _ the phenomenon popularized by actress Shirley
MacLaine of speaking through spirits _ has similarities to demonic
possession. The spirits that emerge in channeling, however, are
supposed to be good, not evil, according to the Rev. James T.
Burtchaell, theology professor at Notre Dame University.
   Exorcism existed before the time of Christ, but is rare in
modern times, and both Burtchaell and Harak said they were
surprised there would have been two exorcisms in a year in New
York. Harak noted the rite may gain prevalence in times or places
of satanic worship.
   ``In the gospels, there's quite a bit of reference to Jesus not
only healing people of diseases but freeing them from diabolical
possession,'' said Burtchaell.
   ``Ever since then, there have been outbreaks of similar
behavior,'' he said. ``It was found that when very holy priests
were sent to pray for and about these very troubled people, there
would be an increase in the behavior, then eventually a complete
liberation from it.''
   Exorcism is more common in countries where Christianity is not
well established or where other influences, such as voodoo, come
into play. Since the 1970's, exorcism has been performed only by a
priest approved by a bishop, archbishop or cardinal.
   ``If you ask most bishops in the country, `Who is your
exorcist?' they probably wouldn't have one. It's an ad hoc thing,''
said Burtchaell. ``Probably a number of bishops would be surprised
to hear there were two in New York,'' one of the largest dioceses
in the nation.
   Typically, he said, an exorcist must be a ``very self possessed,
consistently holy man'' to survive the experience. ``It involves a
great deal of self-abuse, bodies being flung around the room,
excrement, assumed voices _ it's pretty vile stuff.''
   ``The average Catholic would have no first-hand information to
speak of,'' he said. ``The darn movie is going to be the image
everybody has. But, I must say, events in the movie are very
faithful to stories I've read'' about real exorcisms.
   A battery of medical and psychological tests is ordered before
someone undergoes exorcism. ``If a person has Lupus, for instance,
and periodically has seizures where they go out of control, that's
a chemical imbalance,'' said Harak.
   But there also are informal rites to get rid of, or guard
against, demons.
   Harak said a standard, prebaptismal ritual contains ``three
scrutinies that are really rites of exorcism that have been kind of
tamed in the church.''
   ``It's not like, 'Oh, my goodness, William Peter Blatty's 'The
Exorcist.' It's a recognition that there are good spirits, angels,
and bad spirits, devils. And the evil spirit hates human nature,''
Harak said.
   The church also has a practice called deliverance for ridding
``infestations of evil spirit'' less serious than possession, said
Harak. They are performed somewhere in this country every day, by
laity as well as priests.
   ``Usually, the name of Jesus, holy water, holy oils, prayers of
community are so powerful that these deliverances are not
difficult. Many of us do them,'' he said.
   ``Say you've been fooling around with a Ouija board, or the more
modern thing, Dungeons and Dragons. You chant incantations and
stuff like that.'' Those practices could make you susceptible to
evil spirits, he said, especially if you have a psychological or
emotional problem.
   ``Evil spirits are like flies,'' said Harak. ``Our own personal
hatreds or resentments, lack of self worth, faith or love, those
are the garbage in us around which the flies tend to cluster.''

   Israeli leaders dismissed U.S. statements
defining Jewish neighborhoods in annexed Arab east Jerusalem as
settlements and said Monday that the Holy City ``will not be
divided again.''
   Later Monday, Cabinet ministers of the conservative Likud party
gave conditional approval to U.S. proposals for peace talks with
Palestinians.
   There was concern the new U.S. statements on Jerusalem would
complicate efforts toward peace in the Middle East.
   Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war
and has declared the unified city, home to 350,000 Jews and 130,000
Arabs, its capital.
   ``United Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, will not be divided
again,'' Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said in Parliament. ``It will
grow and will be enlarged under Israeli sovereignty. All the
partners to the coalition accept this principle.''
   Arens, of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud
bloc, was supported by Vice Premier Shimon Peres of the center-left
Labor Party, Likud's main political rival and coalition partner.
   ``Following the statements that were heard in recent days and
linked Jerusalem with settlements, the vice premier ... stressed
that he and his party are committed to the unity of Jerusalem,
Israel's capital, and to Israeli sovereignty over the city,'' an
announcement from Peres' office said.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem scheduled a city council meeting
for Tuesday morning to discuss the U.S. position, which also
opposes housing construction for Soviet immigrants in east
Jerusalem.
   ``Israel and the whole Jewish people are united regarding the
necessity to maintain the unity of Jerusalem as Israel's capital,
and opposition to immigrant absorption there cannot be imagined,''
he said in a statement.
   Most Western countries, including the United States, do not
recognize the Israeli annexation and say the status of Jerusalem
should be determined in negotiations. The United States says the
city must stay united.
   The latest U.S. position, first expressed Saturday by President
Bush, objects to Israeli housing projects in east Jerusalem, where
an estimated 120,000 Jews now live.
   ``We do not believe there should be new settlements in the West
Bank or in Jerusalem,'' Bush told a news conference on Saturday.
``I will conduct that policy as if it is firm, and I will be shaped
in whatever decisions we make to see whether people comply with
that policy.''
   Shamir said Sunday: ``There are no settlements in Jerusalem. It
is part of Israel and it will never be divided again.''
   He said the the government would try to direct as many Soviet
Jews as possible to Jerusalem.
   Previously, the United States publicly objected only to Jewish
settlements in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, calling
them an obstacle to peace. About 75,000 Jews and 1.7 million
Palestinians live in the occupied territories.

   Candidates who want faster reform won elections
across the nation's Slavic heartland and Boris N. Yeltsin easily
gained a legislative seat in the Russian republic, unofficial
returns indicated Monday.
   Yeltsin has said he will seek the presidency of the republic,
which traditionally means a place on the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo. That could return the Communist maverick to the
membership he lost in February 1988 for advocating speedier change.
   Leaders of popular movements in the Ukraine and Byelorussia, an
outspoken television commentator in Leningrad and a defiant editor
in Moscow also appeared to have won in Sunday's local and republic
elections.
   ``We're so happy! Such success!'' said Irina Rozhenko of the
Ukrainian pro-democracy movement Narodny Rukh.
   Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the vast Russian republic account
for 80 percent of the Soviet Union and more than two-thirds of its
290 million people.
   Most of the 1,800 contests for seats in the legislatures of the
three republics remained undecided, with no candidate getting the
required majority. State TV said fewer than 15 percent were
resolved in the Russian republic.
   Activists said strong showings in this round nearly guaranteed
victories in runoff elections for candidates who want to step up
the pace of reforms begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The
runoffs are expected in two weeks.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Margaret Tutweiler
said Monday that, ``While, for the most part, these were not
multiparty elections, there were, nonetheless, many hotly
contested, competitive regional and local races, offering voters a
clear choice of candidates and ideologies.
   ``This represents an important and, indeed, historic step
forward in the process of democratization in the Soviet Union,''
she said.
   Defeat of old guard local Communist leaders probably would help
Gorbachev's liberalization. He has railed against functionaries who
hamper reform, and people hoping to exercise new economic freedoms
have told of crippling obstacles erected by local party officials.
   Ukraine party chief Vladimir A. Ivashko, considered a moderate
protege of Gorbachev, qualified for a runoff against an opponent
backed by the Narodny Rukh pro-democracy group. Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov, president of the Russian republic, defeated a lone
opponent in the city of Krasnodar, winning 71.3 percent of the
votes cast.
   Both are members of the Politburo.
   Preliminary figures showed Yeltsin, who has said he will
challenge Vorotnikov for the republic presidency, got 72 percent of
the vote in his district of Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains. He
defeated 11 other candidates, said Anatoly Moiseyev of the Russian
Federation Election Commission.
   Narodny Rukh members said the movement's leader, poet Ivan
Drach, was elected in the first round along with several other
prominent activists.
   Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Byelorussian People's Front, got
59 percent of the vote in his Minsk district, said spokesman Victor
Ivashkevich. He said activist candidates appeared to have carried
cities but party ``apparatchiks,'' including Byelorussian party
chief Yefrem Sokolov, won rural districts.
   In Leningrad, Bella Kurkova, controversial commentator of the
television program ``Fifth Wheel,'' appeared to be the only
first-round winner, said IMA Press, an official youth news agency.
   ``Fifth Wheel'' is a public affairs program that includes long
segments about politics and such social problems as crime and poor
living conditions.
   Despite Leningrad's reputation as a conservative bastion,
pro-democracy candidates dominated the elections, said Yelena
Velinskaya, editor of IMA Press. She said only two of about 150
candidates supported by the ultra-right nationalist group Pamyat
survived the first round.
   Vladislav Starkov, editor of the country's most popular
newspaper, Arguments and Facts, was reported the winner of a seat
to the Russian republic's parliament.
   Starkov ignored a strong suggestion from Gorbachev that he quit
last year after the paper, which has a circulation of 33 million,
printed results of a poll implying human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov was more popular than Gorbachev.
   Unofficial reports said well-known dissident Sergei Kovalyov
also won a seat in the Russian parliament.
   Nearly 150 million voters were registered to vote Sunday and
more than 11,000 candidates vied for 1,800 seats in the three
republic legislatures and thousands more places on local governing
councils. Official results are expected Tuesday.
   Official reports said 86 percent of the candidates in the
Russian elections and 80 percent in the Ukraine were members of the
Communist Party.
   Gorbachev, who was not a candidate, described the elections as a
battle between reformers and entrenched bureacrats, and added: ``I
am convinced that perestroika will win.''
   ``Our elections involve a new type of people, people who have
been given new impetus from perestroika,'' his plan for
restructuring the Soviet society and economy, he told reporters
after voting.
   Political tension has increased in some regions as direct
control from the Kremlin decreases. In recent weeks, Gorbachev has
prodded the Communist Party into giving up its monopoly on power
and pressed for a new, more powerful presidency.
   In Lithuania, candidates of the pro-independence Sajudis
movement swept earlier legislative elections and won more seats in
runoffs Sunday. Of the 25 candidates elected Sunday, 18 were from
Sajudis, according to reports from activists and the official news
agency Tass.
   Some activists in the Baltic republic want the legislature to
vote on secession from the Soviet Union before Gorbachev gets his
new powers, which would include the right to suspend the
legislature of a republic and send in troops.

<HEAD>Officials: Four Killed in Uzbekistan Unrest, Others Say 30</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official said Monday that four people
were killed in ethnic rioting in an Uzbekistan city but activists
said 30 people had died from violence sparked by an election
dispute.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Dmitri Seleznev said in a telephone
interview that about 5,000 people gathered Saturday in Parkent, a
city 30 miles from the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent, to demand the
removal of Meshketian Turkish refugees.
   The crowd attacked the district police headquarters and burned
it down after authorities stopped them from attacking refugees'
homes, he said.
   One soldier and three civilians were killed in the fighting, and
92 people were injured, including 60 police and Interior Ministry
soldiers, he said.
   He said the Central Asian city was relatively quiet Monday.
   The late dictator Josef Stalin forced the Meshketian Turks to
resettle in Uzbekistan from their native area in the republic of
Georgia. Last June, about 100 people were killed in attacks on them
in Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley.
   In a telephone interview Sunday, Yadigar Abidov of the
Uzbekistan grass-roots political group Berlik claimed at least 30
people died after soldiers opened fire on a crowd of Parkent
residents who were demanding registration of their candidate in a
runoff elections for the Uzbekistan parliament.
   He said residents of the city of 200,000 were angry that Ismail
Salimov, a regional Communist Party first secretary, had refused to
allow any other candidates on the ballot.
   Abidov claimed that Salimov and another local party official
were stoned to death by the crowd, but officials denied it.
   The republic of Uzbekistan has been the most recent area of the
Soviet Union to erupt in violence as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
loosens decades of tight Kremlin control.
   Last month, 22 people were killed in rioting in Dushanbe, the
capital of neighboring Tadzhikistan republic. Tensions persist in
the Caucasus republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, where hundreds
have been killed the past two years.
   In addition to ethnic tensions, residents of Uzbekistan are
frustrated by low wages in the cotton-growing republic and
ecological devastation.

<HEAD>Izvestia Prints Draft of Gorbachev Proposal on Presidency</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Elections, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens saw an official draft of Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's proposal for a vastly more powerful presidency
Monday, a week before the Congress of People's Deputies considers
it.
   As printed in Izvestia, the government newspaper, the proposed
constitutional amendments closely resemble the version leaked last
Tuesday, when Gorbachev pushed the plan through the Supreme Soviet.
   The amendments now must be approved by the legislature's parent
body, the 2,250-member Congress, which will hold a special session
next Monday.
   According to the draft in Izvestia, the new president:
   _Must be at least 35 years old and not more than 65.
   _Will be elected for five years and cannot serve more than two
terms.
   _Can veto laws passed by the Supreme Soviet. If the Supreme
Soviet overrides his veto with a two-thirds vote, he can bring the
measure before the full Congress of People's Deputies.
   _Is commander in chief of the armed forces.
   _Appoints the premier and other top government officers, subject
to confirmation by the Congress of People's Deputies.
   _Can block decrees by the Council of Ministers.
   _Has the power to declare a general or partial mobilization, or
``declare a state of war in the event of an attack and promptly
bring the question before the Supreme Soviet.''
   _ Can declare, ``in the interest of the defense of the U.S.S.R.
and security of its citizens, a state of martial law or emergency
in specific places. ... He can, in these cases, introduce temporary
presidential rule. _Issues decrees that ``have obligatory force in
the entire territory of the country.''
   _Is chosen in a nationwide general election. The jurist who
presented the bill to the Supreme Soviet, however, said the first
president would be elected by the Congress to a four-year term
because organizing a general election would take too long.
   Gorbachev's proposal has inspired complaints from the
opposition, who say the president will have dictatorial powers.
Pro-independence groups in the Baltic republics and elsewhere fear
Gorbachev will use the new powers to crush their movements and
their plans for secession.

<TEXT>
   Diminutive actor David Rappaport tried to
kill himself with car exhaust, but police officers saved the star
of television's ``The Wizard,'' authorities said.
   Rappaport, 38, was in stable condition Monday at Queen of
Angeles-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, where he was taken
Sunday evening, according to hospital spokeswoman Peggy Diller.
Rappaport's family asked the hospital to release no other
information.
   Officers found the 3-foot, 11-inch actor unconscious inside a
car at 6:30 p.m. Sunday, said police Sgt. Albert Dravidzius. The
car's engine was running and a hose connected to the exhaust pipe
ran inside the car, Dravidzius said.
   Rappaport was not breathing. Officers used cardiopulmonary
rescuscitation to revive him, the sergeant said.
   Dravidzius said there was no question Rappaport had tried to
kill himself, citing police interviews with the actor.
   In ``The Wizard,'' Rappaport played Simon McKay, an inventor who
helped people in need. The show ran in 1986 and 1987.
   He also appeared as an attorney on the hit TV show ``L.A. Law''
and had a role in ``Time Bandits,'' a 1981 British film comedy
starring John Cleese and Sean Connery.

<TEXT>
   An American businessman was deported Monday after
police accused him of illegally doing missionary work, the official
news agency said.
   Xinhua, in a dispatch Monday from the northeastern port of
Tianjin, said John P. Cragin was ordered to leave China for
conducting missionary activities since October in the guise of
holding English-language classes.
   Local police seized materials he was using for missionary work,
an activity incompatible with his status as a businessman, Xinhua
said.
   China bans proselytizing and allows only religious activities
organized by state-sanctioned church groups.
   The report said Cragin was on the board of directors of a
Chinese-foreign joint venture in Tianjin, but did not identify the
company. It also did not say with what religious group Cragin was
allegedly affiliated.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said Chinese authorities had not
been informed of Cragin's expulsion and the embassy had no
information on the case.
   An embassy official said it would be the first reported
expulsion of an American for missionary activities since 12
American tourists were ordered out in June for distributing
religious materials in the southwestern city of Kunming.
   A Japanese couple teaching at Wuhan University in central China
was deported in January for distributing Bibles to students and
carrying out Christian missionary activities.
   Despite the ban on missionaries, foreign Christian groups
continue to work quietly inside China, mostly by sending badly
needed language teachers to schools in the provinces.
   Foreigners caught proselytizing usually face no more than
deportation, but Chinese Christians conducting religious activities
outside the established churches are subject to more severe
punishment.
   Asia News, a Catholic Church missionary bulletin, claimed in
January that six bishops and 20 priests, deacons and lay people had
been arrested in a crackdown on Chinese Catholics who are loyal to
the Pope.
   China's official Catholic Church has no relations to the
Vatican. About 8 million people belong to the official protestant
and Catholic churches in China. Millions more worship in
underground churches that are banned by the government.

<HEAD>Judge Says Capsizing Possibility May Be Irrelevant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness testified Monday that the
Exxon Valdez would have capsized if skipper Joseph Hazelwood could
have gotten it off a reef, but the judge said the statement may be
irrelevant.
   In a tentative opinion following heated legal argument, Superior
Court Judge Karl Johnstone said he may instruct jurors that the
tanker was immovable, so Hazelwood could not have risked capsizing
it even if he tried to move it.
   Johnstone said testimony so far convinced him that the ship was
hard aground on the reef and could not be moved off by its own
power.
   The judge, however, refused a defense request to strike the
testimony of William Vorus, a professor of naval architecture, who
said the ship was unbalanced after losing oil from some of its
tanks and would have capsized if it got off the reef.
   The judge stressed that he had not made a final ruling on the
issue, and thus continued to allow testimony by Vorus about what
would have happened if the Exxon Valdez was freed from the reef.
   The March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez on Bligh Reef caused
the nation's worst oil spill, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of
Alaska crude oil that devastated the rich population of wildlife in
Prince William Sound.
   The judge accepted a prosecution argument that Hazelwood's
apparent efforts to move the ship could be used to show that his
judgment was impaired by alcohol.
   The Alaska statute covering criminal mischief includes an
additional definition of recklessness, saying that a person who is
intoxicated and thus unaware of a risk may be considered reckless
with respect to that risk.
   In a brief filed with the judge shortly before Monday's session,
the defense argued Hazelwood could not have disregarded a risk
which didn't exist.
   ``The state must show that he actually knew of the risk, that it
was a substantial and unjustifiable one, and that he consciously
disregarded it,'' defense attorney Dick Madson said in the document.
   In addition to the charge of criminal mischief, Hazelwood is
charged with three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a
vessel while intoxicated, and negligent discharge of oil.
   The 43-year-old Hazelwood, of Huntington, N.Y., faces up to 7\
years in prison and $61,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.
   The criminal mischief charge, the most serious, requires a
showing that Hazelwood risked damage to someone else's property
valued at more than $100,000.
   Johnstone said the prosecutor specified before trial that the
property in question was the shoreline of Alaska and the wildlife
of Prince William Sound.
   But during the legal arguments, Assistant District Attorney
Brent Cole said he might change that, if necessary, to claim that
Hazelwood risked damage to his ship by trying to get it off the
reef.
   The judge did not immediately say whether he would permit such a
change in strategy at this point.
   Vorus, a professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
explained how the ship was unbalanced when holes punched in the
hull allowed sea water to replace the oil, which weighed less than
the water.
   Asked for his expert opinion, Vorus responded, ``If it had
gotten off the reef ... our analysis shows it would have capsized
and sunk.''
   Prior to Vorus' testimony, William Milwee Jr., an expert in
salvage of grounded ships, heatedly denied a defense lawyer's
suggestion that he was coached by the prosecution into his
conclusion that Hazelwood acted recklessly when he tried to
maneuver the ship after running aground.
   ``I independently reached my opinion,'' Milwee said.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John P. Zanotti, president and publisher of The
Cincinnati Enquirer, was named publisher of The Arizona Republic
and The Phoenix Gazette on Monday.
   Zanotti, 41, fills a vacancy created by the retirement of Pat
Murphy on Aug. 8. Unlike Murphy, he will be in charge of the
newspapers' business as well as their editorial side, a spokesman
for the papers said.
   In addition to his role as publisher of the newspapers, Zanotti
will be executive vice president and chief executive officer of the
Arizona Business Gazette and of Phoenix Newspapers Inc., which
publishes the three papers, said the spokesman, William Shover.
   The appointment culminates a seven-month search throughout the
United States, said Frank Russell, president of Indianapolis-based
Central Newspapers Inc.,, which owns Phoenix Newspapers Inc.
   ``John Zanotti is a person with a proven track record as
publisher of a major metropolitan newspaper and he is uniquely
qualified to lead these newspapers into the 1990s,'' Russell said
in a news release.
   Zanotti was named president and publisher of the Enquirer in
1985, a year after joining Gannett Co. Inc., the owner of the paper.
   He also has had operational responsibilities, without editorial
duties, for The Cincinnati Post under a joint operating agreement
with the Enquirer.
   As publisher of the Republic and Gazette, Zanotti will be in
charge of news and business operations, returning the newspapers to
the situation that existed when Darrow Tully was publisher, Shover
said.
   Murphy, who replaced Tully, was in charge of news operations
only, while William Hogan, vice president and general manager for

<HEAD>Nine Officers, Wife Plead Innocent in Drug Money Skimming Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine sheriff's deputies pleaded innocent
Monday to charges they skimmed more than $1.4 million in seized
drug money, and one deputy's wife pleaded innocent to
money-laundering charges.
   The officers, among 10 suspended last September when allegations
of cash skimming were made public, were accused in a 27-count
indictment of using the drug money to buy homes, luxury cars,
jewelry and stocks.
   All but one of the indicted officers belonged to an elite squad
called the Major Violators Crew II, or Majors II, a senior
narcotics unit that claimed some of the department's biggest
cocaine and money seizures.
   The unit's leader, Sgt. Robert Sobel, agreed to plead guilty to
conspiracy charges and testify as a prosecution witness against the
other deputies, said Sobel's attorney, Mark Beck.
   At Monday's arraignment, the nine deputies each said ``not
guilty'' as U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie read their names
and counts against them. The judge set trial for July 10.
   The officers are all free on bonds of $25,000 to $75,000.
   The indictment said that after raids the officers skimmed drug
proceeds, turned in remaining cash as evidence, and filed falsified
police reports understating the among of money seized. The
indictment alleged the money was hidden in safes, safe deposit
boxes and bank accounts.
   Pleading innocent to conspiracy, money laundering and tax fraud
were Terrell Amers, 46, of Pomona; James Bauder, 31, of Palmdale;
Eufrasio Cortez, 39, of Chino Hills; Ronald Daub, 39, of Whittier;
John Dickenson, 31, of Northridge; Macario Duran, 43, of Mission
Hills; Daniel Garner, 44, of Irvine; Michael Kaliterna, 42, of
Chino Hills; and Nancy Brown, 50, of Alta Loma.
   All but Duran were members of the narcotics unit.
   Duran's wife, Maria Duran, pleaded innocent to a charge she
structured transactions to avoid federal rules requiring banks to
report deposits of $10,000 or more.

   Teen-agers hurled bottles, looted
stores and vandalized cars Monday during a two-mile march to
protest alleged racist hiring practices at their high schools,
authorities said.
   Scores of police officers in riot gear were called in to quell
the late morning disturbance, but by the time it ended early in the
afternoon only six teen-agers were arrested, said police Sgt. John
Beerling. One minor injury was reported.
   ``During the march, the students became unruly and began
rioting,'' Beerling said. ``They looted, damaged automobiles and
committed other acts of vandalism and swarmed onto the campus.''
   Damage was confined to a few broken windows and dented fenders,
he said.
   The riot began after about 400 students from Leuzinger High
School in neighboring Lawndale marched to Hawthorne High School to
protest alleged racism in hiring in the Centinela Valley School
District, which encompasses both campuses.
   Officers from several cities and the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department were dispatched to the school, 15 miles
southwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   The protest came three months after a heated election for the
Centinela Valley Board of Education in which several candidates
lodged allegations of racist policies in the district. Details of
those allegations weren't immediately available.
   ``Some carried signs in support of Ken Crowe, the principal of
Hawthorne High School who recently announced his resignation,
effective at the end of the school year,'' said school district
spokesman Dan Finnegan.
   The protest began about 10 a.m., when some students walked out
of classes at Leuzinger High School for the march, said a secretary
in the office of Principal Sonya Davis. There was no disturbance at
Leuzinger and many of the 3,000 students didn't know anything was
going on, she said.
   Resident Mark Reise said he was driving by Hawthorne High School
about 10:30 a.m. when the Leuzinger students arrived.
   ``They were rowdy, yelling and screaming. But it looked like it
was a staged affair. I think it's the old political stuff that's
been going on at Hawthorne High School for years,'' said Reise.

<HEAD>Mother Arrives in New Zealand to See Daughter She Went to Jail for</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH MAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American mother who went to
jail to protect her daughter arrived in New Zealand on Tuesday to
press her custody fight with her former husband, who she claims
molested the child.
   Elizabeth Morgan, the 42-year-old Washington cosmetic surgeon
who has for three years battled for sole custody of Hilary
Foretich, refused to acknowledge waiting journalists at Auckland
International Airport.
   Morgan slipped through a side exit after arriving on a flight
from Los Angeles and was ushered into a car. As the car sped away,
she bowed her head to avoid waiting cameras.
   The daughter Hilary, 7, was first smuggled to Britain and then
to New Zealand, where she has been living with her maternal
grandparents under the name Ellen Morgan.
   Morgan was jailed for 25 months in 1987 for refusing to reveal
her daughter's whereabouts when a Superior Court judge in
Washington, D.C., granted the child's father, Eric Foretich,
unsupervised visits.
   Foretich spent two years tracking Hilary down and arrived in New
Zealand last week.
   Foretich, 45, a dental surgeon from Falls Church, Va., has
vigorously denied the allegations of child sex abuse and kept a low
profile in New Zealand. He also has countered that Morgan in
mentally ill.
   Although she has not seen Hilary in more than two years, Morgan
said through her New Zealand lawyer she would not immediately fly
to Christchurch for a reunion.
   Instead, lawyer Lyn Stevens said she will spend a ``few days''
meeting with her lawyers and with Hilary's attorney.
   Morgan's efforts to avoid the media apparently included booking
her Air New Zealand business-class seat under the name of Mr. J.
Morgan through to Sydney, Australia. She also booked a ticket on an
early flight Tuesday from Auckland to Christchurch as Mr. J. Morgan
but that reservation was canceled from Los Angeles on Sunday,
travel agents told The Associated Press.
   Stevens said Morgan has high regard for the New Zealand Family
Court system, which is to rule on the custody issue. No date has
been set for a hearing.
   ``She is acutely conscious of the strong tradition in New
Zealand of keeping matters before the Family Court private and
confidential,'' Stevens said. ``Accordingly, she requests that all
media respect the privacy of herself, her family and Hilary.''
   ``She is very pleased that in New Zealand the best interests and
welfare of Hilary are regarded as the paramount consideration,''
her lawyer said.
   Stevens said Morgan would not meet the media during her visit.
He said he did not know when she will go to Christchurch or how
long she is visiting.
   Morgan reportedly has spoken only once to her daughter by
telephone since she was jailed. And it seemed likely on her first
day in New Zealand she would not be able to talk because all phone
communications were down in Christchurch, 190 miles south of
Wellington, the capital.
   Telecom, the national telephone company, could not explain the
communications failure.

   Four U.S. soldiers were released from
the hospital Monday after being injured in a weekend grenade attack
on a disco that killed one American serviceman. Two others remained
hospitalized, the U.S. military said.
   CBS News meanwhile reported Monday night that a cocaine
smuggling ring involving U.S. soldiers and Colombian suppliers was
recently broken up in Panama.
   ``Senior American commanders say one American serviceman has
confessed to recruiting returning G.I.'s to work as `mules,' or
couriers, to carry cocaine to the United States on military
flights,'' the network said.
   CBS said seven Colombians and two Americans have been arrested.
   The U.S. Southern Command in Panama said it had no information
on the report. ``We are coordinating with investigative agencies to
see if there is anything to it,'' spokeswoman Marjorie A. Boggs
said.
   CBS said officials investigating Friday's grenade attack on the
discotheque My Place are looking into the possibility that the
bombing was connected to the breakup of the smuggling ring.
   One American soldier was killed and 16 American servicemen and
12 Panamanians were injured in the attack on the disco, known to be
frequented by Americans.
   The Southern Command said the two soldiers who remained
hospitalized were in ``stable, satisfactory condition.''
Spokeswoman Peggy Black said ``the prognosis is real good'' for
their full recovery.
   Those released Monday were Spc. Ronald Sallis, 22, of Chippewa
Falls, Wis.; Airman 1st Class Joseph Pelletier, 20, of Bucksport,
Maine; Pvt. David C. McKinney, 28, of Amarillo, Texas; and Airman
Warren A. Waters, 22, of Phoenix.
   Remaining in the hospital were Petty Officer 2nd Class Charles
L. Curtis, 26, of Shelby, N.C., and Petty Officer 3rd Class Calbert
Malone Jr., 23, of Greenville, Miss., a Southern Command statement
said.
   Hospital officials said another four Panamanians remained
hospitalized in ``stable'' condition but gave no further details.
   The Southern Command said Army Spec. Anthony B. Ward, 21, of
Houston, died Saturday of chest and abdomen wounds at the U.S.
military's Gorgas Hospital in Panama City, where the injured are
being treated.
   Witnesses said two men yelling ``Long live Noriega!'' threw a
grenade through a glass wall of the disco at about 11:30 p.m., then
sped away in a car. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
It was the first such attack on U.S. soldiers in Panama since the
invasion.
   Panamanian police said they had questioned several witnesses to
the bombing but announced no arrests.
   Although organized resistance to the invasion died out quickly
and Noriega's Defense Forces have been disbanded, Panamanian
officials have said Noriega's paramilitary groups could resurface.
Officials believe large caches of weapons are hidden around the
country.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in Miami, where he was
taken after surrendering to U.S. authorities on Jan. 3. He had been
hiding out in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   Also Monday, the Panamanian government extended its
midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew that has been in effect since the Dec. 20
invasion by the United States toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``The state is obliged to maintain the curfew and checkpoints
for cars and people,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, vice president
and minister of justice and security. The curfew has no expiration
date.

   An earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter
scale struck near Vanuatu in the south Pacific, the Hong Kong
Observatory said Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of damage.
   An observatory statement said an initial reading of the quake,
which struck at 11:49 a.m. EST Monday, revealed the epicenter to be
about 1,400 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
   No further details were available on the quake, which matched in
intensity the tremor that rattled the San Francisco Bay area last
Oct. 17. That quake killed 67, injured about 3,000 and caused an
estimated $7 billion in damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater. A magnitude 6 can cause severe damage on land while
a tremor of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread and heavy
damage.

   An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale
jolted a remote mountain area Tuesday near China's western border
with Pakistan and India, the State Seismological Bureau said.
   The tremor struck about 4 a.m. (3 p.m. Monday EST) near Gilgit,
a town in the Karakorum Mountain range of Jammu and Kashmir, an
area claimed by Pakistan and India, the bureau said.
   It said there were no other details immediately available.
   An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale is capable of
causing severe damage in a populated area. The Richter scale gauges

   Cabinet ministers from Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc on Monday gave conditional approval
to U.S.-mediated peace talks with Palestinians.
   But new complications arose when leaders in the occupied lands
said Palestinians in the territories will serve on a delegation to
talks with Israel only if the PLO chooses it.
   The Likud ministers' decision came at the end of a five-hour
meeting in Shamir's office and was adopted unanimously.
   ``Israel is interested to continue the peace process according
to its peace initiative, and to hold the proposed meeting with a
Palestinian group in order to work out the methods of elections in
Judea, Samaria and Gaza,'' it said, using biblical names for the
occupied West Bank.
   However, the decision, released by Shamir's office, set several
conditions.
   It said Israel should ``speak in one voice'' and therefore an
agreement with Labor was needed ``in ... essential and basic
issues: guaranteeing Israeli sovereignty over the whole Jerusalem
(and) preventing the PLO from taking over the process.''
   The Israeli peace initiative, approved by the government last
May, offers Palestinian elections in the occupied lands to choose
negotiators for talks on limited autonomy. The final disposition of
the occupied territories is to be decided later.
   Israel refuses to negotiate the status of Jerusalem, which it
has declared its capital after annexing the city's eastern, Arab
part. It was captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Palestinians, who have been waging a nearly 27-month-old
revolt against Israeli rule in the West Bank and occupied Gaza
Strip, demand an independent state with East Jerusalem as its
capital.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, trying to bridge various
differences, has suggested several compromise moves to bring about
preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo, Egypt.
   Baker has reportedly suggested Israel accept any negotiator
registered as a resident of the West Bank or Gaza Strip. That may
include Palestinian exiles somehow affiliated with the PLO and
Arabs who actually live in East Jerusalem, and thus satisfy PLO
demands.
   The Likud decision made no reference to the question of
Palestinians deported from the occupied lands, suggesting Likud may
be ready to accept them as negotiators.
   But the ministers ruled out participation of East Jerusalem
Arabs, saying they ``shall not participate in the process linked to
the peace initiative, either by participating in elections or by
being elected.''
   A positive response from Likud is seen as crucial in the Israeli
acceptance of the U.S. proposals. The main elements have already
been accepted by the left-leaning Labor party, Likud's political
rival and partner in the coalition government.
   Labor has threatened to leave the coalition if Likud blocks the
peace process.
   Likud's conditional approval remained vague regarding the agenda
of Cairo talks, which Israel wants to be limited to its elections
plan. The Palestinians want an open agenda enabling them to raise
independence demands.
   Another part of the Likud decision touched on the participation
of the PLO, which the Palestinians call their sole legitimate
representative. Israel considers the Palestine Liberation
Organization a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it.
   ``Attempts by PLO to penetrate or take control over the process
in any form would lead to a stoppage of the meeting and Israel's
withdrawal from it,'' the statement said.
   The Likud decision was announced hours after 34 Palestinian
leaders from the occupied territories signed a statement demanding
the PLO select any delegation to peace talks with Israel.
   ``No Palestinian from the Israeli-occupied territories will
participate in any delegation that is not formed or announced by
the PLO,'' it said.
   Baker's compromises reportedly included having Egypt announce
the Palestinian delegation, and the Palestinian statement saying it
should be made public by the PLO was likely to further complicate
peace moves.
   Another complication is the new U.S. position of citing Jewish
neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as ``settlements,'' a definition
earlier reserved for settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``It certainly did not help,'' a senior Likud official noted
after the meeting.
   The U.S. statements regarding Jerusalem on Monday drew angry
responses from Israeli leaders, including Labor head and Vice
Premier Shimon Peres, who stressed his party's commitment to united
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir predicted Labor would accept
Likud's demands.
   ``These are very easy in my mind for Labor, being committed to
united Jerusalem and (the idea that) the PLO would not penetrate
the process. We don't foresee any special problems with Labor,''
Ahimeir said.
   President Bush urged American Jewish leaders Monday to help
promote a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians as soon as
possible.
   ``This remains the surest path available to promoting a peace
that would ensure Israeli security and the legitimate political
rights of Palestinians,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Bush made the appeal in a telephone conversation with Seymour
Reich, president of the Conference of Presidents of American Jewish
Organizations.
   Reich called National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft asking to
speak with the president; Bush called him back.

   President Bush, back from summit talks where
he pledged a ``global partnership'' with Japan, now faces the
challenge of proving he can act on his vow to turn around the U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   Even as the president headed back Sunday from the meeting with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt complained that the summit
appeared to be another case of good intentions but no specific
actions to improve the $49 billion annual trade deficit with that
country.
   ``Nothing has changed,'' Gephardt said.
   But the Missouri Democrat said the increasingly protectionist
Congress will wait until summer for concrete action from the two
leaders' promises, before it considers trade sanctions against
Japan.
   
   MIAMI (AP) _ The United States may sharply curtail the granting
of asylum to Nicaraguan refugees because of their nation's switch
to democracy, but there is little chance political exiles already
here will be forced to return.
   In theory, people granted asylum are subject to review each
year, and could have that status revoked, said Duke Austin,
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Washington.
   ``But I know of no single case since political asylum has been
an avenue in the United States when we have involuntarily returned
someone because conditions in their homeland improved,'' Austin
said. ``It's in the law, but it's never been done.''
   What is more likely is that new applicants will get tougher
scrutiny of their applications.

   Greyhound drivers were returning to the picket lines today after
holding back for a day in memory of a striker crushed by a bus
driven by a replacement. Fewer companies than expected applied to
take over Greyhound's routes.
   The union, meanwhile, said the company turned down a request to
resume talks, but America's only nationwide bus system said it
hasn't formally been asked.
   The union and Greyhound Lines Inc. also quibbled Sunday over how
many union drivers have crossed picket lines since the strike
affecting 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000 office and maintenance
workers began Friday.
   Greyhound has been operating with 700 replacement drivers plus,
it says, 350 union drivers who crossed picket lines. But the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions said only 95
union-represented drivers were behind the wheel.
   
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) _ Civil-rights leaders assessed their
movement's progress as about 4,000 people re-enacted the historic
voting-rights march to Montgomery and ``Bloody Sunday''
confrontation with police on a bridge 25 years ago.
   ``Lord knows we're not where we ought to be, but thank God we're
not where we used to be,'' Hosea Williams said Sunday as he crossed
Edmund Pettus bridge.
   ``We've come a long way. But Lord knows we've got a much further
way to go,'' Williams said.
   From that bridge, named for a confederate general, Williams on
March 7, 1965, first saw the state and local police who ordered the
marchers to disperse, then used billy clubs and tear gas to chase
them back across the bridge. The day went down in civil-rights
annals as Bloody Sunday.

   Bombs are exploding in Beirut, Marines are
dying and Americans are worried. White House spokesman Larry
Speakes is asked if President Reagan has read a House report on the
latest attack in Lebanon.
   ``I don't think he's read the report in detail,'' Speakes says.
``It's 5{ pages, double-spaced.''
   For Paul Slansky, author of ``The Clothes Have No Emperor: A
Chronicle of the American 80s,'' that 1984 glimpse of the Free
World's leader said it all.
   ``And then, three weeks later, Reagan says that he reads every
comic strip in the newspaper,'' Slansky said. ``That to me is
definitive.''
   Almost everything the Great Communicator said or did seemed
brainless to Slansky. Most ignored Reagan's gaffes, misstatements
and blemishes. Slansky seized upon every one of them, packing 10
filing cabinet drawers with newspaper and magazine clips
documenting a decade the author describes as ``wallowing in
mediocrity.''
   ``The Clothes Have No Emperor'' (Fireside Books, $12.95), the
resulting book, is a digest of dirt, a chronological collection of
items documenting American culture's lowest moments.
   In 1981, Reagan failed to recognize his only black Cabinet
member, Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, at a White House
reception. ``How are you, Mr. Mayor?'' Reagan asked Pierce. ``I'm
glad to meet you. How are things in your city?''
   Vice President Bush, touring an Auschwitz death camp in 1987,
said, ``Boy, they were big on crematoriums, weren't they?''
   In 1988, Vice President Dan Quayle takes his turn with the
Holocaust, calling it ``an obscene period in our nation's
history.'' Correcting himself, he says ``in this century's
history'' is what he meant. ``We all lived in this century,'' he
says, adding, ``I didn't live in this century.''
   It's not that Slansky picks only on Republicans. His victims
also include such Democrats as ex-presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis (``an arrogant little fool'') and Sen. Joe Biden of
Delaware, and a range of celebrities, including Vanna White,
Michael Jackson, Tammy Faye Bakker and even the movie ``Ishtar.''
   ``Satirical is just a word applied to it,'' said Slansky, a
contributor to Esquire, Spy, Village Voice and The New Republic.
``All I'm basicallydoing is chronicling what people say. It's just
the truth, that's all.
   ``This book is not irreverent. This book is contemptuous. ... It
happens to be funny, but it is very serious ... a history book of
the '80s. This book should be a textbook, it should be taught in
journalism courses. This is a serious piece of work that has a
goofy cover.''
   The cover, sporting silly pictures of a broken-nosed Geraldo
Rivera, Gary Hart with Donna Rice, and Mr. T in the lap of Nancy
Reagan, belies an admittedly unforgiving, obsessive account of
almost every presidential misstep.
   Slansky does show isolated affection for some of his friends,
including comedian Harry Shearer and artist Robbie Conal.
   On page 232, Slansky recalls Reagan's visit to Notre Dame, where
he presides over the unveiling of a Knute Rockne stamp. Flubbing
the one line he's probably used more than any other, Reagan says,
``Win just one for the Gippet.'' Gipper was the nickname of
football star George Gipp, who Reagan portrayed in ``Knute Rockne,
All American.''
   ``This book is not written for anybody who voted for Reagan and
liked Reagan,'' Slansky said. ``They'd be foolish to buy this book.
This was written for everybody who, for the last eight years, was
made to feel like they were freaks of culture by the media. ...
   ``Nixon was hilarious. He was the best show there was. He had
this need to self-destruct in public. What better theater can you
get than that?
   ``Reagan was much less funny for me. I can't stand his ignorance
_ the fakeness of it. There wasn't a moment in eight years when I
thought he was amusing. Not only was he an actor, but also, to me,
such a lousy actor.''
   Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the former president, declined to
comment on Slansky's depiction of Reagan as an incompetent. ``We
don't comment on other people's books,'' Weinberg said.
   ``The Clothes Has No Emperor'' is sprinkled with celebrity lows.
From March 1988, the books offers this gem from a Geraldo Rivera
interview with a man named Tommy Arthur: ``Your wife wants you to
die. Your reaction, quickly.''
   Said Slansky: ``This wasn't an era that was totally enamored of
excellence. ... This is a country that was wallowing in mediocrity
for years _ and here was the guy who completely reflected us just
as we reflected him. And when I say `we,' I sure don't mean me.''
   Were there times when he considered Reagan too easy a target?
   ``No. Because nobody else was shooting at him. Quayle could be
considered too easy a target. ... But I am after Dan Quayle. He is
my enemy in public life right now. He is the stupidest man I've
ever seen there, and I don't want a stupid man like that running
the country. I was raised to think that intelligence mattered.
   ``Reagan did whatever they said. Here's one of my favorite
quotes from the administration. One of his aides said, `If we told
Reagan to walk outside, turn around three times, pick up an acorn
and throw it out to the crowd, we'd be lucky to get a question from
him asking why.'
   ``He just wasn't there,'' Slansky said. ``I think he was
emblematic of the '80s _ totally style over substance. Here was the
emptiest suit we ever elected.''

<HEAD>Immigrant Professionals Have Trouble Finding Jobs in Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   She was an astrophysicist in the Soviet Union,
but couldn't find scientific work in Israel and offered to take a
job cleaning Professor Herman Branover's lab.
   Branover, a Soviet-born physicist who immigrated in 1972, told
the story to illustrate what he sees as a major problem in settling
the thousands of Soviet Jews arriving in Israel: the lack of jobs,
especially for the well-educated.
   He said the woman was desperate for work and, when told there
was no scientific job, offered to clean the lab because she would
feel at home there and might be able to do some reasearch on her
own. He turned her down.
   The Science Ministry estimates 60,000 scientists, engineers and
physicianss will arrive in the next two or three years because of
Moscow's more liberal emigration policies.
   ``We are going to have to make jobs for these people if we are
going to keep them,'' Branover said, and that has given him a cause.
   He owns a factory that employs Soviet immigrants and has become
a champion of developing new private industries for the ``army of
scientists'' arriving in Israel.
   ``The government is still talking about how to build housing for
the immigrants,'' he said. ``I've never heard of anyone who didn't
come to Israel or who left because of bad housing, but there are
thousands who left because they couldn't find jobs.''
   Officials estimate the government will need $3 billion in the
next three years to help resettle the Soviet immigrants, most of it
for housing, education and Hebrew instruction. Only $400 million is
earmarked for job placement and retraining.
   Government resettlement plans are built largely on the theory
that a growing economy will produce jobs, but the economy is
stagnant and two years of recession have pushed unemployment to
nearly 9 percent.
   Universities and research institutions have few openings, and
some new arrivals find the work available is neither in their field
nor to their liking.
   In a Tel Aviv suburb, two physicians were among several dozen
Soviet immigrants packing matzo bread for shipping.
   Dr. Anatoly Roeburg, a cardiologist from Moldavia, told
reporters: ``Israel is a great place, except we can't find proper
work. If this goes on, I am not going to stay here.''
   In the 1970s and early 1980s, Israel could cope with immigration
easily because few Jews were permitted to leave the Soviet Union.
   Only 202 Soviet Jews arrived in all of 1986, but now 1,200 land
in Israel every week.
   Israeli towns, especially those in rural areas whose populations
have drained away to the cities, are eager to take the immigrants
but unable to offer them work.
   Safad, in northern Israel, has 400 government-owned apartments
standing empty, but few jobs.
   ``What we need now is investment in industries and other
work-producing enterprises,'' the town's mayor, Zeev Perel, told
The Jerusalem Post.
   Branover, a physicist at Beersheva University, agrees with
Perel. He lobbies the government and business groups to create
high-tech industries for the newcomers, and practices what he
preaches.
   Two years ago, with a $2.5 million investment from Australian
industrialist Joseph Gutnick, Branover started a high-tech company
in Jerusalem called SATEC.
   It employs 35 immigrant Soviet scientists in electronics,
hydrometallurgy and heating. Sales were $1.5 million last year and
are expected to double in 1990.
   Branover is seeking new capital to expand into medical
engineering and start another company for 30 Soviet scientists at
Beersheva, in southern Israel.
   Even if th new ventures pan out, Branover noted that the total
number of jobs involved in his operations would be fewer than 80
and many more were needed.
   ``We want other investors, other industries to try,'' he said.
``We must not miss this opportunity.''
   His experience with SATEC indicates it takes ``$60,000 per
scientist and two years' time'' to get a profitable business going,
Branover said, then declared:
   ``If you go this route, you can not only satisfy those people
who come, but it is also a vital thing for Israel. We can make out
of Israel a Japan.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ratings still begin with a decimal point, but
Cable News Network is standing by its fledgling dinner-time
newscast, ``The World Today.''
   CNN launched the one-hour program in October, starting it at 6
p.m. EST, a time slot in which its second half-hour competes
directly with the nightly newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC in the
Eastern and Central time zones, where 75 percent of the nation's
viewers live.
   CNN's new show gained some immediate attention with the
selection of Catherine Crier, up until last year a Texas judge, to
join veteran newsman Bernard Shaw at the anchor desk _ Crier in
Atlanta, Shaw in Washington.
   The ratings show they aren't yet in the same league with ABC's
Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather. Far from it.
   Last week's Nielsens showed ABC's ``World News Tonight'' winning
its eighth consecutive victory with an 11.3 ratings average,
followed by the ``NBC Nightly News'' with a 10.1 average and the
``CBS Evening News'' with a 9.9.
   CNN says its ratings are averaging a .7, but the gap is even
bigger than it looks. In broadcasting, one rating point equals
921,000 homes. In cable, one point for CNN equals 547,820 homes,
the number CNN estimates it serves.
   But CNN says ratings for ``The World Today'' are growing every
month, and already are 16 percent better than the two programs
previously in the same time period.
   ``We're going to move ahead and stick to our game plan,'' said
Paul Amos, CNN's executive vice president of news programming.
``We're not going to abandon this in the short term. This is a very
long-term-oriented project.''
   Amos said the program has proved ``to be the right move ...
because we've managed to take a time period that was relatively
stagnant and improve on it.''
   Among other things, the program will be served _ although not
exclusively _by the new CNN investigative unit headed by Pamela
Hill, who for years was in charge of ABC News' now-defunct
``Closeup'' documentary unit.
   Hill's team, whose reports will start airing this month on CNN
broadcasts, includes former NBC political correspondent Ken Bode,
who signed on Friday as a contributing correspondent.
   Bode, who left NBC News last year to teach, will continue his
other job as a college professor, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   Bode is a print and broadcast news veteran. But not Crier. CNN
took perhaps one of its biggest chances when it hired her for ``The
World Today.''
   Her journalistic debut coincided with the program's, but Crier,
35, a civil judge for five years, said the parallels are
``tremendous'' between her old profession and her new one.
   As a trial lawyer, she said, she gathered facts by interviewing
witnesses and then delivered those facts clearly to a judge or
jury. As a judge, she said, she had to glean facts from piles of
evidence and draw objective conclusions.
   But while a judge might take weeks to weigh a case's evidence
before ruling, Crier said, TV reporting requires an enormous amount
of spontaneity because of its immediacy.
   Amos acknowledged that some at CNN were concerned about Crier's
inexperience.
   ``She was an unknown commodity,'' he said. ``And once she
started working at a computer terminal, Catherine Crier became
another staffer, and the rest of our journalists came to know her
and have warmed up to her.''
   CNN plans to publicize ``The World Today'' this spring with a
major advertising campaign.
   Many viewers have watched their evening news on the same network
for a generation, Amos said, adding, ``a 25-year-old ingrained
habit _ ... that's a tough habit to break.''
   ``It's going to take a long time to make the public aware that
we are here,'' he said. ``Less than 60 percent of the nation's
households have cable or access to the program.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television ...
   RATHER EXAMINES BURNOUT: Thursday's ``48 Hours,'' anchored by
Dan Rather, will examine the human cost of too fast a pace in life
and business in America. Among other things, the CBS show will
report on a California entrepreneur who CBS says ``has turned his
car into the office of the future _ and his life into a
round-the-clock rush hour.''

<HEAD>Rio's Famed Christ the Redeemer Statue Being Repaired</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christ the Redeemer, the famous
statue that watches over Rio, is being repaired after more than a
half-century of battering by rain, mountain winds and dramatic
temperature changes.
   ``Adverse weather conditions have done a great deal of damage,''
said architect Joel Ghivelder. ``The renovation is absolutely
necessary and timely.''
   Ghivelder is coordinating the $2 million renovation for the
Globo media empire, which is splitting the cost with the Brazilian
subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell oil company.
   Seeping moisture has reached iron plates beneath the 125-foot
statue's light green soapstone facade, causing them to rust and
expand to up to eight times their original size, Ghivelder said.
   ``The expansion has caused cracks and swelling on the statue's
surface, and some chunks of soapstone have already fallen off,'' he
said.
   No one has been hurt by the falling stones, one of which weighed
25 pounds, and Ghivelder attributes that to ``Christ's presence.''
   Engineers will preserve as much of the statue's original surface
material as possible, but about 10 percent of the soapstone must be
replaced, the architect said.
   Scaffolding will cover the Christ until about July and the
restoration, to include landscaping and improvements in public
facilities, will be completed in the fall. The hope is to finish
the work by the statue's 59th anniversary in October.
   Until then, the final flights of stairs leading to the monument
will be sealed off.
   ``The renovation is extremely important and urgent,'' said Jose
Geraldo Machado, technical director of Riotur, the municipal
tourism board. ``Brazil's image is established through Rio, and the
Christ statue, along with Sugar Loaf Mountain and Copacabana's
beaches, are the city's three top symbols.''
   Heitor de Costa Silva conceived the statue in the early 1920s in
a competition, sponsored by a popular magazine, to choose a
national monument.
   French sculptur Paul Landowski created the Christ's 12-foot
high, 35-ton head; the hands weigh nine tons each and are 75 feet
across.
   When French engineers had designed the outstreched arms and
body, the parts were sent from Paris, dragged up 2,400-foot
Corcovado Mountain and mounted on supporting pillars. The statue
was inaugurated Oct. 12, 1931.
   Hundreds of thousands of people visit the site every year, to
see the statue and enjoy the spectacular view of Guanabara Bay, the
open Atlantic, the mountains, hills and the vibrant city below.
   In his book ``The Insider's Guide to Rio,'' Christopher Pickard
wrote: ``In truth, the view is beyond description. Words and
photographs are not enough.''
   Ghivelder said: ``Christ the Redeemer is one of the country's
biggest attractions, for both foreigners and Brazilians. We want to
recover the statue and give it back to the city, clean, neat and
beautiful.''

<HEAD>Line Up to Cash in on the `Peace Dividend'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the past week or so, claims against the
peace dividend have been posted by the nation's governors,
advocates of U.S. aid to the emerging democracies of eastern Europe
and Central America, and 79 U.S. senators.
   They'll have to get into line with all the others looking to
cash in on defense spending cuts to finance other aims _ or to cut
taxes.
   ``One of my colleagues ... sent me a note saying he felt that
half of the peace dividend should be applied to education,'' said
Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley. ``And half of it to health.
And half of it to deficit reduction. And half of it to tax
reduction. And half of it to the infrastructure.
   ``And half of it to creating a new mathematics to explain how
six halves equal one whole.''
   It's a harmless political pastime right now, because there isn't
any peace dividend to pay for other things or cut the deficit this
year.
   ``The peace dividend is peace,'' says Vice President Dan Quayle.
   But nobody doubts that the defense budget is going to be cut,
freeing resources to go elsewhere, unless there is an incredible
reversal of the already incredible change that has swept eastward
to Moscow, easing if not ending the Cold War.
   The Pentagon warns that a reversal could happen, but CIA
Director William H. Webster told Congress last week that it is
unlikely, even if hardliners were to take over in Moscow.
   The administration isn't forecasting a budget bonus now or soon,
resisting pressure in Congress to carve one out of defense
spending. There are certain to be cuts in the administration's $296
billion defense budget, an increase in dollars although not enough
to match inflation.
   But Democrat Foley said that in the early phases, it will be
difficult to wring major savings out of defense cuts that close
bases, recall troops from abroad or cancel weapons contracts.
   ``The immediate impact is sometimes to increase costs in the
short term,'' he said. ``But there's no question ... we're talking
about very significant savings to be realized.'' Foley said he
thinks the eventual savings should be split, half to reduce the
federal deficit, half to ``the social deficit'' of financially
strapped domestic programs.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Tex., raised the issue in the Senate last
week with an amendment suggesting that any peace dividend be used
to cut taxes. He said the only discussion had been about ways to
spend the money, when the government shouldn't spend it at all but
should give it back to taxpayers.
   ``I do not believe it is too dramatic to say that the No. 1
issue of the 1990s, if things continue to move in the current
direction in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, will be what to
do with the peace dividend,'' Gramm said.
   Before the Senate got to its hypothetical legislation, the
National Governors Conference had adopted a resolution urging
President Bush ``to dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced
manner between the federal budget deficit, education and other
productivity investments.''
   There were no numbers attached.
   Nor were there any dividend estimates when congressional
advocates of aid for the newly elected government of Nicaragua and
the fledgling democracies of eastern Europe put in their bids,
saying defense savings should finance economic assistance.
   There were some figures when the Senate had its mini-debate on
the peace dividend, but they varied so widely as to be meaningless.
Gramm said he thought defense budget savings might total $50 to $70
billion by the mid-1990s. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the
cuts should add up to $163 billion over the next five years.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the budget committee, said
it was premature to be talking about uses for a peace dividend that
isn't there yet. But he said the debate at least produced the first
Senate consensus that there will indeed be one.
   Sasser and the Democrats proposed their own peace dividend
measure, declaring that the savings should go toward balancing the
budget, meeting urgent national priorities and reducing taxes for
working people.
   That was approved, 79-19, and Gramm's version was rejected,
50-48. Neither commits anybody to do anything, which makes them
perfect election-year exhibits for campaigning senators, who can
point to them as votes in favor of cutting taxes.
   ``It is a kind of kissing-your-sister resolution,'' Gramm said
of the Democratic version.
   There may be a lot of that before the Nov. 6 elections.

   A year ago, Islamic fundamentalist Ahmed
Kofahi had been dismissed as a university teacher and was in prison
for criticizing the government. Now he's a member of Parliament.
   Kofahi is heard regularly in state radio broadcasts of
parliamentary debates, excoriating assorted government officials.
   His progress from prisoner to legislator illustrates the quiet
changes Jordan has undergone the past year.
   ``The atmosphere's different now,'' Kofahi said in an interview.
``We have more freedom, but it's not enough.''
   Islamic fundamentalists and leftists who won seats in the
November elections are pressing for tough investigations of
government corruption, greater social justice and curbs on security
agencies.
   Human rights ``are born before the human is born,'' Kofahi said.
``It's not a gift from a leader or a party or an authority, and not
to have these rights is equivalent to death.''
   Jordan is bordered to the north and east by Syria and Iraq,
whose ruling parties brook little opposition. Kuwait, the most
liberal state on the Arabian Peninsula to the south, suspended its
parliament in 1987.
   ``I'm sure the countries surrounding us are not happy about
what's going on here,'' said Taher Masri, who resigned from the
Cabinet to make a successful run for Parliament.
   Reform in this kingdom of 3.1 million people, whose western
neighbor is Israel, is more orderly and less sweeping than the
change revolutionizing Eastern Europe.
   As in Eastern Europe, however, popular revolt is behind it. Four
days of riots last April caused by price increases and other
grievances cost 10 lives and shocked King Hussein into action.
   Hussein, who has ruled since 1953, is relinquishing many powers,
but retains firm control and is personally popular.
   In November, he oversaw Jordan's first general elections since
1967, which were among the freest ever held in the Arab world.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood won the largest bloc of
seats in the 80-member Parliament. Kofahi, running on the
Brotherhood ticket, got more votes than any of the other 650
candidates.
   Mudar Badran, Hussein's choice for prime minister, underwent an
extraordinary grilling by legislators about his personal finances
and professional record before winning a vote of confidence.
   Since last April, the government has freed all prisoners held
without charge and dozens convicted of political related crimes.
   Radicals who once took up arms against Hussein have been allowed
to return home, and the pervasive General Intelligence Department
has been stripped of its powers to withhold passports and bar
people from travel or employment.
   The government has promised to make officials accountable for
corruption. A former undersecretary of the Supply Ministry was
arrested last month in a graft investigation.
   Badran has promised to end martial law, imposed 23 years ago
because of the 1967 Middle East war, and appointed lawyers to
determine which of the decrees issued during that time should be
abolished.
   He also promised to repeal a 1935 defense law inherited from the
British mandate that allows officials to ignore many civil rights.
The law now is used more widely in Israel than in Jordan.
   Although the 33-year-old ban on political parties remains in
force, it was ignored during the election campaign. The government
says it will legalize parties after a new ``national charter'' of
principles is submitted to a referendum, probably this year.
   Police have not interfered with street demonstrations, which
have been few and small. A 1988 decree nationalizing newspapers was
canceled and they were returned to their former managers, but
government institutions retain majority ownership.
   ``The government is not involved in any way in restricting the
press,'' Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine said.
   All the changes have not been liberal. The victory of Islamic
fundamentalists set back campaigns for Western-style women's rights
and encouraged censorship on moral grounds.
   Masri, the former government minister, said he is convinced
Hussein ``will not retreat'' from reforms.
   Jordan has had parliaments since the 1920s. Most were weak, and
any that showed signs of independence were suspended.
   Since 1948, however, Jordan has gone from a land of peasants and
nomads with one high school to a nation that nearly equals Sweden
in the percentage of young people going to college or technical
school.
   With such an educated population, Masri said: ``You can't hide
anything anymore.''

   They are among the more than 440,000 East
Germans who have resettled in West Germany in the past year. Thomas
and Angelika Weitz and their 6-year-old daughter fled their
homeland with a train load of other ``embassy refugees'' just
before the collapse of communism in East Germany. A reporter who
interviewed them at the time recently revisited the Weitz family to
see how they've fared after six months of freedom.

   When Angelika Weitz first
walked into a West German store to buy yogurt, she was so
overwhelmed by the abundance of flavors she broke out in a cold
sweat.
   When she visited a doctor for the first time, she learned that
here a patient need not bring a towel from home.
   Even fresh air was a novelty for Mrs. Weitz and her family who
fled East Germany and resettled in West Germany about six months
ago.
   For Thomas and Angelika Weitz and their 6-year-old daughter,
Jenny, there is a new job, a new home. They are slowly making new
friends, with no worries about being watched by the secret police.
   They have no plans to return to East Germany even though
democracy is supplanting communism in their homeland since they
boarded a train in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and arrived in West
Germany with thousands of other ``embassy refugees.''
   The family now lives in a new, neatly furnished apartment with a
large bedroom, bath, country-style kitchen and living room just
outside Offenstetten, in a rural wooded area of Bavaria 240 miles
southeast of Frankfurt.
   Thomas Weitz, a 30-year-old trained machinist who earned about
$150 a month at a factory in East Germany, found a job in a
paint-and-body auto repair shop and takes home about $1,050 a
month, enough for him to afford a used car. A small color
television and a stereo adorn a table in their living room.
   In the East German city of Zwickau, about 145 miles south of
Berlin, their run-down apartment had no bath and not enough water
pressure for an inside toilet, says Mrs. Weitz, 40, who worked as a
nurse's assistant in East Germany.
   ``The place was falling apart,'' she says.
   ``Here there are lots of deer and rabbits,'' chimed in little
Jenny, cuddling a stuffed toy dog on the living room couch.
   Zwickau's polluted air caused her and Jenny to have chronic
breathing problems, Mrs. Weitz says.
   ``That's one of the main reasons we wanted to leave,'' she says.
   Zwickau, a city of 130,000 people, is heavily industrialized
with smokestacks belching noxious brown smoke into the air,
producing the sort of sooty grimness so common in such East German
cities.
   Because they had applied several times to resettle in the West
and because she had complained often about medical treatment, the
``Stasi,'' as the East German secret police were called, began
monitoring the family's activities, Mrs. Weitz says.
   ``I was often sick after Jenny's birth in 1983 and had trouble
getting proper medical treatment,'' she says. ``Then I was finally
operated on for a uterus problem. Now the doctor here tells me that
I may have to be operated on again.''
   But Mrs. Weitz says she has been able to cut down on medicine
since the family settled in Offenstetten.
   ``I can breathe again and Jenny sleeps well, she has an appetite
and doesn't cough all night like she did before.''
   The family has been back to Zwickau only to visit relatives
since East Germany opened its borders on Nov. 9.
   The couple said they feel it will take years for East Germany to
catch up with the West, despite the democratic changes.
   ``I am 40 years old, and West Germany took 40 years to get this
far,'' Mrs. Weitz says. ``I don't have time to wait for that over
there.''
   With some 340,000 East Germans arriving in West Germany in 1989
and 100,000 so far this year, there has been some resentment among
West German taxpayers who complain the resettlers are getting
special treatment in obtaining homes and jobs.
   The newcomers also are eligible for social payments until they
are resettled and find employment.
   West Germany, about the size of Oregon, has a population of 61
million people and is already overcrowded. The country also faces a
chronic housing shortage, and January's unemployment rate was 8.5
percent with 2,191,400 registered jobless.
   Despite that, the Weitz family says they have been treated well
since their arrival, probably because they do not live in one of
the country's large cities where housing shortages and joblessness
are most prevalent.
   ``We have always been treated just like everyone else. No matter
where we go, shopping or in restaurants,'' Mrs. Weitz says.
   But she recalls a humorous incident when she first visited a
doctor in the West.
   ``I can tell you come from the East Germany,'' the doctor told
her.

<HEAD>OFFENSTETTEN, West Germany: told her.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Why? Because of my accent?'' she asked. ``No, because you
brought along your own towel.''
   The Weitzes still marvel at the abundance in West Germany
compared with their homeland.
   ``I like yogurt,'' Mrs. Weitz says. ``When I went into a store
to buy some for the first time after we got here, my knees got weak
as I saw all the flavors there, and I broke out in a cold sweat
trying to decide on which one to buy.
   ``I had to leave that store and walk around outside to compose
myself before I finally got up the nerve to go back in and buy
some.''
   The Weitz family was in the first train load of East Germans to
arrive in Hof, West Germany, from Prague on Oct. 1, just 17 days
before hard-line communist leader Erich Honecker was ousted during
a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations.
   At the time, like thousands of other East Germans who had fled
to West Germany's embassy in Czechoslovakia, the family expected no
quick changes in their communist homeland, and decided to risk an
escape.
   ``We packed only a few things, no marriage certificate or
anything to give a clue that we were leaving for good, and caught a
flight from Schoenefeld airport in East Berlin to Prague because we
didn't need a visa to go there,'' Weitz says.
   ``We didn't tell our families _ no one, for fear the secret
police would find out. We feared constantly that maybe we wouldn't
make it.''
   The family took a taxi to the West German embassy immediately
after landing in Prague in the evening of Sept. 30. There they
learned that West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
had just announced that everyone would be allowed to leave for West
Germany by train.
   From there, in a deal worked out between East Germany and West
Germany, about 6,000 East Germans inside and outside the Prague
embassy boarded trains that would take them to the West by crossing
back through their homeland.
   The Weitz family told of the harrowing trip from Prague and how
secret police boarded the trains in East Germany to tell the
refugees they were being expelled from their homeland.
   Weitz says they first realized they were in West Germany when
the sound of the tracks became smoother and the train started going
faster.
   ``You have to go slow in the East Germany, because the tracks
are all worn out,'' he says.
   At the Deggendorf refugee camp in northeast Bavaria, the family
was first put in a large hall with beds for 40 people.
   ``It was overcrowded and sanitation was bad,'' Mrs. Weitz says.
``So we moved into a small hotel for three days where we could
sleep in private and take showers.''
   Later they moved into a boarding house in the nearby town of
Gotteszell, about 70 miles northeast of Munich, where they stayed
about a month.
   There Weitz got a temporary job at a car repair shop cleaning up
and helping out for $29 a day.
   ``I didn't care as long as I could make some money,'' he says.
   Through word-of-mouth, Weitz says he was introduced to the owner
of a small paint-and-body car shop in Offenstetten.
   ``Through that contact I got my job and our apartment. It costs
us $410 a month, but we expected that,'' Weitz says.
   Asked what they think of the dramatic changes in East Germany,
and if there is any chance they might return to help build up the
country, Weitz replies:
   ``I'm happy about most of the change that all of us leaving
helped bring on. Perhaps I'd return if I got the backing to start
my own business.''

   It used to be the rare sign in a shop window
that proclaimed, ``Se Habla Espanol.'' But more and more Spanish is
the second language in the United States. It reflects the
importance of a Hispanic population that the 1990 census will count
at more than 20 million and growing.

   Call it the Latinization of America. Comprende
usted?
   For instance, in a martial arts movie on cable television the
Oriental warriors speak Spanish.
   In California, the telephone company puts out special yellow
pages in Spanish.
   In New York City, a growing number of bus and subway ads for
familiar products are in Spanish, and all the safety instructions
are in English and Spanish.
   And a major American movie, ``An American Tail,'' was recently
released simultaneously in Spanish and English versions, whereas in
the past a Spanish version would have appeared months after the
English release.
   More and more, Spanish is heard in America's big cities,
becoming common enough to be used in business and on ballots.
   The number of Hispanics in the United States surpassed 20
million last year, and is rapidly growing, according to Census
Bureau estimates. Hispanics now comprise 8.2 percent of the U.S.
population.
   ``I believe that we see ourselves in the same light as previous
immigrants ... the Irish, the Italians, the Germans who came
before,'' says Eduardo Pena, chairman of the League of United Latin
American Citizens.
   ``We don't want to change America, we just want to be part of
it. We want to be as much Americans as anybody else.''
   Yet as they try to assimilate into U.S. life, many Hispanics
feel ``their Americanism is being questioned'' by efforts to make
English the official language of the United States, says Ronaldo
Cruz, associate director of the U.S. Catholic Conference
Secretariat for Hispanic Affairs.
   ``The Hispanics are angry. They're hurt. They're upset,'' he
says.
   Cruz also pointed to moves to limit immigration and exclude
illegal immigrants from the 1990 Census as areas of concern to
Hispanics.
   Pablo Sedillo, director of the Secretariat for Hispanic Affiars,
says, ``When they get here they encounter discrimination,
exploitation, in a land that they thought was free, a land of
opportunities.''
   Problems are even greater for those arriving illegally, since
they lack documents that ease the way into jobs and face the
continual threat of being discovered and deported.
   But legal or illegal, the influence of Hispanics on American
life, business and politics is undeniable.
   Between 4 million and 4.5 million Hispanics were registered to
vote in 1988, and they were openly courted by Spanish-language ads
in local newspapers and broadcast media.
   Early in the 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush promised to
appoint the first Hispanic Cabinet member. President Reagan beat
him to the punch by selecting Lauro Cavazos as education secretary.
   Bush kept Cavazos on, and also picked Manuel Lujan as interior
secretary.
   Americans of all backgrounds have come to enjoy the music of
such groups as Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine and Los
Lobos. The song ``La Bamba'' enjoyed a recent revival as the title
track from a movie about the life and brief career of the late
singer Ritchie Valens (Valenzuela).
   Ricardo Montalban, meanwhile, became a widely seen spokesman for
automobiles on national television.
   The Census Bureau, preparing for the 1990 head count, is telling
Hispanics: ``Hagase Contar'' _ make yourself count. It's something
Hispanics already are doing at the cash register.
   ``Corporate America has rediscovered the Hispanic market ... a
lot of major corporations are targeting advertising to Hispanics,''
says Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the National Council of La
Raza.
   Hispanic food also has become more popular in major cities where
a variety of restaurants _ Mexican, Cuban, Salvadoran and others _
reflect the local Hispanic communities.
   Mexican tops the list. The research firm Packaged Facts reports
that 38 million households eat Mexican foods, sales of which rose
55 percent between 1982 and 1987.
   Kraft's Velveeta now comes in a spicy Mexican version,
jalapeno-flavored potato chips are sold nationally, and farmers in
New Mexico report doubling their crops of chiles between 1977 and
1987.
   But there has been some confusion.
   For example, Borden advertised ice cream using the slang Mexican
term ``nieve,'' which literally means snow. The campaign worked
fine in California and Texas, where there are numerous
Mexican-Americans. But in the East the Cubans and Puerto Ricans
thought the company was literally selling snow, the magazine
American Demographics reports.
   Remember the Frito Bandito, a mustachioed, sombrero-wearing
bandit who used to sell corn chips on television?
   Frito-Lay laid him to rest in 1971 after complaints from
Hispanic groups that the portrayal was demeaning. Frito corn chips
are still big sellers and the company now donates money to build
playgrounds in Hispanic neighborhoods.
   In 1984, Coors signed an agreement with a coalition of Hispanic
groups promising to provide $325 million over several years for a
variety of programs for the Hispanic community, as well as to
emphasize procurement and employment programs for Hispanics.
   Univision, the largest Spanish-language television network, is
estimated to reach 17 million Hispanics, with at least 5 million
regular viewers. Formerly known as the Spanish International
Network, it has been joined by a second Spanish network, Telemundo,
with more than 3.3 million regular viewers, according to cable
industry experts.

   As far as Hispanics are concerned, ``the word minority is
becoming extinct in some parts of the country, although that may
not have hit the policy types yet,'' says Elvira Valenzuela Crocker
of the Mexican-American National Women's Organization.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live in
just three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed by
Texas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.
   Florida has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New
Mexico and Colorado, the Census Bureau reports.
   Latinos are younger, on average, than the rest of the
population. In 1980 their median age was 23, compared to 30 for
Americans in general.
   That means more are in the childbearing years and they are
producing a higher growth rate than the rest of the nation. In
1988, Hispanics averaged 94 births per 1,000 women ages 18 to 44,
compared to 67 per 1,000 for the rest of the country.
   That also means more young Latin Americans are in the nation's
schools, raising the issue of bilingual education in many cities.
   That as-yet-unresolved debate centers on whether it is better to
teach children in their own language while they learn English, or
to immerse them only in English as a means of improving their
skills in that language while they are learning other subjects as
well.
   Only about 44 percent of Hispanics age 25 and over have
completed high school, compared to nearly 70 percent of
non-Hispanics.
   Cary Davis, a researcher at the private Population Reference
Bureau, views the growing Hispanic population as a source of needed
labor in the coming years.
   ``When the baby boom starts to retire in 20 to 30 years, who
will provide the work force? It will be an increasingly minority
and Hispanic society,'' Davis says.
   ``The labor force is going to be very different in the next
couple of decades, with a need for improved literacy and employment
training to educate the work force,'' adds Navarrete. ``We see this
as a challenge for the United States, but also a very positve
thing.''
   ``We have to think through what kind of investment to make in a
group with lower levels of educational attainment, that doesn't
have a tradition of education,'' Davis says.
   And Davis cautions non-Hispanics against being ``overly
pessimistic'' about these changes.
   ``They will not be all newly arrived immigrants, there is an
assimilation process going on,'' he says.
   ``Hispanics will soon become the majority of entry-level workers
in some metropolitan areas,'' reported the Population Reference
Bureau in a 1988 analysis of the Hispanic population.
   However, limited educations and language skills have held down
incomes, with per-capita income in 1988 averaging $7,956 for
Hispanics, compared to $8,271 for blacks and $13,896 for whites.
   While many Hispanics are not citizens, the Constitution
specifies that the census count all residents of the country, not
just U.S. citizens. Thus, when census figures are used for
political reapportionment and distribution of federal and state
funds, areas with more people _ Hispanic and otherwise _ will be
the gainers.
   Their presence will mean added clout for areas where they live
following the 1990 census.
   Between 1974 and 1988 the number of Hispanic elected officials
in the country grew from 1,500 to 3,300, including 10 members of
the House of Representatives.
   William O'Hare of the Population Reference Bureau has speculated
that minorities, including Hispanics, could gain six to 10 more
House seats after the 1990 census.
   While Hispanics are not as likely to register as other
Americans, that gap has been narrowed by registration drives in
recent years.
   And when they do register they are as likely to vote as anyone
else.
   In 1988, officials estimate, 44 percent of voting-age Hispanics
were registered, compared to 54 percent of blacks and 60 percent of
whites.
   The census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
United States at 20,076,000 as of March 1989, up from 19,431,000 a
year earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000; Puerto
Ricans, 2,328,000; and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   In addition to the challenges they pose, Davis points out that
the growing U.S. Hispanic community can form an important resource
in international business relationships in coming years.
   ``The notion of a smaller world tells us that as we look to
international trade we have a community of representatives who can
work in Central and South America and help establish linkages to
those countries,'' he says.

   Southeast Asia's answers to the Champs Elysees
and Fifth Avenue are Orchard Road in Singapore and Nathan Road in
Hong Kong, both beacons to tourists and fashion-conscious shoppers
in the exotic Orient. Here are two stories describing what has
become some of the most expensive real estate in the world.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orchard Road is the very symbol of Singapore,
one of the world's smallest and most successful countries, a place
where consumerism is indeed conspicuous.
   The official guide to this city-state says, ``Orchard Road is a
testament to modern Singapore, with its pedestrian malls shaded by
huge trees and enlivened by small gardens full of tropical blooms
and lush greenery.''
   This 239.5-square-mile country, with no natural resources except
a strategic location and the skills of its 2.6 million people,
enjoys the highest standard of living in Southeast Asia and the
second-best in all Asia after Japan.
   With Hong Kong, it is arguably the most unabashed materialistic
society in the region.
   Orchard Road recently was rated in a private survey by the New
York real estate firm Huberth &amp; Peters Inc. as the world's
10th-priciest street in terms of commercial space for rent.
   Conspicuous consumers abound, both the domestic and tourist
variety.
   Status-conscious ``Chuppies,'' as Chinese Yuppies are known,
sport Rolex watches, designer clothes, jade rings, Mercedes-Benz
cars and a taste for the latest in food and fashion.
   Orchard Road is where they can shop till they drop, eat till
they pop and then plop into the swimming pool at the Hilton,
Dynasty, Mandarin or some other elegant hotel.
   Named for the nutmeg and tropical fruit plantations that lined
it in colonial days, Orchard Road is centrally located and easily
reached by Singapore's 2-year-old subway system. Thousands of
domestic servants, most of them from the Philippines, throng the
tree-lined street on Sundays, the usual day off for maids here.
   They catch up on gossip from home and take advantage of the
three main features of Orchard Road: shopping, eating and
people-watching.
   The survey by the New York real estate firm showed that one
square foot of shop space along the 1{-mile thoroughfare costs an
average of $175 a year. By comparison, the survey found that one
square foot for a year costs $675 on The Ginza in Tokyo, the
world's costliest shopping district.
   A check by The Associated Press found that the more desirable
retail space on Orchard Road fetched more than $350 each year. Rent
for shops in the popular but by no means top-of-the-line Lucky
Plaza is now $368 per square foot a year, almost double that of
last year.
   The multistory Lucky Plaza houses scores of shops selling
electrical appliances, clothing, jewelry, watches, cameras,
cosmetics, shoes, sporting goods, luggage, radios and hi-fi
equipment, plus restaurants and bookstores.
   While the mostly locally owned retail outlets in Orchard Road
pay the highest rents in Singapore, they also charge from 30
percent to 50 percent more for their merchandise than other
shopping areas. Much of it consists of high-priced imports and for
everyday necessities most Singaporeans eschew the glittering
boulevard for more modest stores in Chinatown and elsewhere.
   The Huberth &amp; Peters survey found one common denominator to the
most expensive streets around the world was that they almost always
contain designer names and upscale shops.
   The brands prominently displayed along Orchard Road include
Cartier, Gucci, Christian Dior, Dunhill, Omega, Rolex. Boutiques
and department stores offer the latest in high style and casual
wear from the fashion centers of Europe and North America.
   Not all the fancy branded goods are what they seem, however.
Many tourists are pestered by touts to buy ``genuine copy-watches''
from certain stores at a fraction of the price of the real thing.
   ``The selling of fakes is at the heart of the touting problem.
Touts are there mainly to persuade people to buy fakes,'' says
police Deputy Superintendent Ng Kee Hoe.
   In the eight months prior to Feb. 1, the police arrested 126
touts and seized 11,564 fake watches from 61 shops. First offenders
can be fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to six months or both.
   Some touts appear to have their own turf and competition among
them is as fierce as that between McDonald's and Burger King.
   One of the first McDonald's outlets in Singapore was in Liat
Towers at 541 Orchard Road. It proved so popular that after the
Burger King franchise holder bought the building, Big Mac lost the
coveted location to the Whopper.

   In a city known worldwide as a shopper's
paradise, no road is better traveled by the legions of
bargain-hungry tourists than Nathan Road in the heart of Kowloon
peninsula.
   Tourists pour out of the five-star hotels and economy guest
houses that co-exist at the head of Nathan Road, making the retail
space along that stretch among the most expensive on Earth to rent.
   Retailers along the street say that from 50 percent to 90
percent of their business comes from overseas visitors.
   ``Over the past years, the number of tourist arrivals have been
increasing at a non-stop rate, so recently the rentals have kept
going up,'' says Albert Chan, head of the retail department of
Vigers Hong Kong Property Consultants. He estimated annual
increases of about 30 percent in the past few years.
   Indeed, Nathan Road and Queens Road across the harbor on Hong
Kong island were listed second in a recent survey of the world's
most expensive commercial rental streets.
   According to the survey, conducted by a New York commercial real
estate firm, space on Nathan Road rents for $575 a square foot a
year. Only the Ginza in Tokyo is more expensive.
   The high rents apply to only the first half dozen or so blocks
of Nathan Road, a four-lane street that begins at the stately
Peninsula Hotel and runs past Kowloon Park before heading into the
overcrowded, lower-rent districts to the north.
   The head of the street, near the British colony's famed Victoria
Harbor, is a bazaar of swank boutiques selling the latest
high-priced fashions and of bargain basements offering ``I Love
Hong Kong'' T-shirts and silk ties for just over $1. Gaudy neon
signs hang low over the sidewalk.
   There also are several dank and dark alleys leading off the
road, home to venders selling cheap art, luggage and various types
of pornography.
   Among the designer stores on the street are Charles Jourdan,
Diane Freis, Alfred Dunhill and Benetton. Department store branches
include Yue Hwa Chinese Products and Lane Crawford, the priciest in
town.
   Nathan Road also has dozens of shops selling cameras,
electronics, watches and jewelry, and haggling is often required to
get the best price.
   For tourists who cannot afford name-brand watches, on many a
corner are young men who whisper offers of counterfeits to
passersby.
   Retailers typically rent out space on the ground floors of the
luxury hotels and run-down commercial buildings that front the
street. There are a few new structures along the road, including a
mosque and a two-tiered retail center built in front of the park.
   Real estate professionals say that some retail space on Nathan
Road can go for about $770 a square foot a year. The recent asking
price for one of the street's rare vacancies was 10 percent higher.
   Nathan Road retailers interviewed by The Associated Press,
however, indicated that rents can be much lower.
   Peter Lau, owner of Volvo Video and Camera Supplies, says he
pays $446 a square foot to rent the store he has occupied for two
months.
   Lau says his 1,000-square-foot shop, jammed with the latest
electronics, must bring in nearly $9,000 a day to break even. He
says he is making a profit.
   Retailers say the political turmoil in China hurt sales during
much of last year, scaring tourists away and dampening the spending
mood of local consumers.
   But the tourist business is recovering and Nathan Road still
remains a Mecca for visitors in search of the legendary Hong Kong
shopping experience. Several factors, including the colony's status
as a duty-free port, traditionally have made local prices for many
goods among the most competitive worldwide.
   Joan Lyon of London, Giordano shopping bag in hand, was in the
latest wave of visitors to Nathan Road, which she described as a
``new Bond Street'' that was ``devoid of atmosphere.'' Bond Street
is London's ritziest retail row.
   ``We are having a little bit of a spending spree,'' Mrs. Lyon
said during a break from window-shopping. Prices generally are
comparable to those in London, she said, but quickly added, ``I
think there are bargains to be had here.''

   There comes across the American cultural
landscape once in a while someone who enhances life on a grand
scale. These are the builders of a Lincoln Center, a Kennedy
Center, a Music Center of Los Angeles and more. They are many
spirits and this is the story of one of them _ Alice Tully.

   She is an American Muse, like her sisters in
Greek mythology, a patron of the arts.
   Here in America, the Muse is not mythic. Here feminine largess
has created museums, art galleries, ballets, orchestras and concert
halls that enrich the nation's cultural life.
   In this tradition is Alice Tully. And she at 87, in all modesty,
is hopeful there are more. There already are many.
   Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center is home to chamber music and
to the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped
found. Today she is only an interested bystander, but her heart is
in it everyday.
   Her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln
Center, suggested she pay most of the costs of a small concert hall
to be built at the center.
   ``When he asked, I had the most wonderful feeling,'' she
recalls. ``And I just knew this is for me. I said, `Oh, Arthur, I
can't think of anything I'd rather do.' I was overjoyed.
   ``On very important occasions, that voice inside of me tells me
things. And I heard inside of me, `Well, this is what you came to
do.'''
   The honor role of American Muses is long.
   In New York, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney founded the Whitney
Museum in 1930 to house American art.
   Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Sullivan and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
founded the Museum of Modern Art in 1929.
   Jane Wrightsman, Lila Acheson Wallace, Brooke Astor and Joan
Payson have contributed hugely to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   Blanchette Rockefeller gave one-third of her American art
collection to the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco.
   Eleanor Belmont, by starting the Metropolitan Opera Guild, got
that opera house through the Depression. Lucia Chase for years used
her fortune to support the American Ballet Theater.
   Anne Bass, Nancy Zeckendorf and LuEsther Mertz donate to ballet.
Martha Hyder of Fort Worth aids the Van Cliburn Competition.
   There are builders of concert halls. The Filene Center at Wolf
Trap near Washington was built by Jouett Shouse with money from
that department store fortune.
   Buffy Chandler donated and raised money for the 25-year-old
Music Center of Los Angeles, for which Lillian Disney recently
donated $50 million to build Walt Disney Hall.
   Louise Davies gave the San Francisco Symphony's hall. Frances
Pew Hayes paid for the symphony's new hall in Naples, Fla. Patricia
Corbett, with money from door chimes, is a music philanthropist in
Cincinnati. The University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of
Music has Corbett Auditorium and Patricia Corbett Theater and at
the top of the Cincinnati Symphony's Music Hall is a ballroom named
Corbett Tower.
   Miss Tully is the granddaughter of Amory Houghton Jr., the
founder of Corning Glass. Her career was as a concert singer.
   ``My mother wasn't interested in the arts per se,'' she recalls.
``My parents never expected to have an artist in the family. But
they were very kind when they realized that I just wanted to sing,
and that was it, and that I was only too anxious to work. And so
they let me do it. That was wonderful, that they let me go and live
and study in Paris. At that time (1923) it was not the usual
thing.''
   She hasn't been a philanthropist all her life. ``I didn't have
anything to give until after my mother died,'' she says. ``I always
wished that I could because I was always so interested in that
world.''
   She knew how artists struggled. ``I had friends who were
painters and sculptors and singers and composers. They all needed
money.''
   Miss Tully, by nature a person of dignity, reserve and gracious
charm, was talked into allowing Alice Tully Hall to be named for
her for by John D. Rockefeller III. ``I would have liked it better
being anonymous. Absolutely. It took me six months to make up my
mind to give my name to the hall because I knew what would happen.
And it did.''
   Within a week, she says, requests for donations poured in. ``Now
it's worse than ever. When I came back on Monday, there was a stack
of mail like that.'' She gestures high above a table. ``And I had
taken out a stack like that when I went off on the weekend. I sit
up late at night opening mail.
   ``In the arts, the need is greater than ever. Expenses go up so
steadily. And of course that wonderful fantasy world of opera where
we can lose ourselves is the most expensive of all. It is so
wonderful and I have loved it since I was a child. I love all forms
of art.''
   Now she pours tea from violet-sprigged china in the living room
of her Manhattan apartment, with its moss-green carpet and
draperies and bleached-oak paneling. Flowering plants are placed on
occasional tables and windowsills. Her two pet Maltese dogs, Sophie
and Tati, scamper in to bark hello.
   That is present tense. Past tense she can remember the lunch
when she first heard of the Lincoln Center project, a year before
President Eisenhower turned the first spadeful of earth and gave
the signal to start the steam shovels, June 1959.
   She was not just a philanthropist. Alice Tully Hall, which opens
on the street, is tucked into a corner of the Juilliard School.
Miss Tully objected when Juilliard wanted to make it part of the
school. ``I had, above all, to stand my ground, which I did.''
   It took her three years of insistence to get the wide space
between the chamber hall rows. She has more letters over the last
20 years thanking her for the comfort than she has received about
the fine acoustics.
   Arthur Houghton also suggested to Gian-Carlo Menotti that he
call on his cousin when the composer was looking for money to start
a summer music festival in Spoleto, Italy. Miss Tully has been a
supporter ever since. In January, a benefit to repair hurricane
damage at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., was held
at Alice Tully Hall, with Miss Tully attending.
   Some have referred to Miss Tully as a grande dame of arts
philanthropy. But that is not how she thinks of herself.
   ``I just do what I like to do, what I think I have to do and
what it is my privilege to do.''

   It's a posse of volunteers ready to gallop off
after horse thieves and it keeps a noose handy. The Wild West? No,
upstate New York, circa 1990. Admittedly, the horse thief trackers
of the Empire State haven't had much to do most of this century,
but they stay organized, in case they're ever called on.

   ``The 167th annual meeting of the
Schodack, Stuyvesant, Kinderhook and Chatham Society for the
Detection of Horse Thieves is hereby called to order. Any old
business?''
   ``Not since that horse was stolen 73 years ago.''
   ``New business?''
   ``Not till the next horse is stolen.''
   ``What's on the menu this year?''
   ``Same as always. Minced-ham sandwiches, clam chowder and oyster
stew.''
   ``Meeting's adjourned. Let's put on the feed bags.''
   That's as lively as it gets these days for the horse thief
trackers of Columbia County, 30 miles south of Albany. The group
has met on the first Saturday in February since 1824, when the most
serious environmental emission was what landed on a dirt road.
   ``It's just a tradition,'' said the society's president, Lewis
Leggett, 78, who can't remember when he joined the group. The last
time anyone called on the society to track a stolen horse was in
1917, when Henry Ford was busy transforming the nation's stables
into garages.
   For Woody Klose, president of the Red Hook Society for the
Apprehension and Detention of Horse Thieves in neighboring Dutchess
County, carrying on the group is more than tradition.
   ``It's got to be the greatest organization in the world,'' said
Klose, a lawyer and county legislator. ``It meets just once a year
and we haven't had a horse theft in years. Thieves are so terrified
of us that they leave our horses alone.''
   In Columbia County, a mule went on the hoof in the 1930s, but it
came back by itself. One year someone stole the hobbyhorse off a
villager's porch. Another year, a society member stole the group
president's old gray horse as a joke. The prankster wasn't hanged
or even horsewhipped.
   About 10 years ago, a couple of horses were stolen from a local
breeding farm, but police didn't call on the volunteer posse.
   ``I think they figured the troopers could do a better job,''
said society secretary Ralph Duck.
   Yet the group still has nearly 200 members who gather once a
year to meet with old friends they otherwise wouldn't see, said
Duck, 79, who joined about 50 years ago.
   The group began when eastern New York was still on the frontier
and horse thieves ran unbridled among the farming towns hugging the
Hudson River. Horses were practically part of the family, doubling
as transportation and as plow power.
   ``You could probably get away with stealing a man's wife easier
than stealing a man's horse,'' Leggett said. ``If you lost your
horse, you lost your heart.''
   The society still has the noose used to hang horse thieves. But
members don't know when _ if ever _ it was used.
   ``I've always had the feeling they didn't hang them around here
like they did in the Wild West,'' Duck said.
   Similarly, the minutes of the Red Hook society are ``terrific
about writing down who didn't show up at the meetings, but they
don't say anything about catching horse thieves,'' Klose said.
   ``I can't find any report of a member ever having done
anything,'' he said.
   A feeling of continuity keeps the 65 members of the Red Hook
society, founded in 1796, crowding around the trough for their
roast beef dinner on the first Tuesday of every October, Klose said.
   ``We still live in what we like to think of as a semi-rural
area,'' he said. ``It makes you feel good because you can go back
to minutes from seven or eight generations ago and find the same
names of people attending our meetings today.''
   Unable to afford full-time posses, farming villages formed
societies _ like today's volunteer fire departments _ to trail
horse thieves.
   Each year, societies elected a group of riders who would be
called in when a horse was stolen. The Columbia County society paid
its riders $2 a day while they were on the trail. Red Hook riders
earned more money the farther they rode. They got a bonus if they
trailed a horse thief out of Dutchess County and brought the bandit
back home, Klose said.
   The societies also acted as insurers, paying farm families the
money to replace stolen horses.
   As automobiles and tractors replaced horses in the early 1900s,
most horse theft societies folded.
   On today's thoroughbred ranches, there are few worries about
stolen horse flesh. It's tough to launder a stud horse, whose value
depends on careful documentation of its parentage.
   ``If you wanted to take a stolen horse to Outer Mongolia, you
could probably get away with it,'' said Mary Midkiff of the
American Horse Council in Washington, D.C.
   While horses don't vanish from New York farms anymore, horse
thief detectives haven't donned blinders when it comes to their
science. Annual meetings feature experts discoursing on police
trail dogs, the horse in folklore and archaeological evidence of
eohippus, the prehistoric forerunner of today's horse.
   Even so, the posses of Columbia and Dutchess counties won't be
saddling up anytime soon.
   ``With the state of modern law enforcement,'' Klose said. ``we
don't take things into our own hands anymore.''

   Martin Mull, co-star of the new CBS sitcom
``His &amp; Hers,'' is a laid-back comic performer who works hardest at
something he's really serious about _ painting.
   ``Performing is my day job,'' he explains. ``I'm so serious
about art I get crazy. I paint every day. I paint until I'm
exhausted. I'll start painting and suddenly realize it's 2 o'clock
in the morning.''
   Although he has a master's degree in painting from the Rhode
Island School of Design, Mull is known primarily for his acting and
writing.
   In ``His &amp; Hers,'' he co-stars with Stephanie Faracy. They play
marriage counselors trying to make it work as partners at home and
the office.
   ``We've done 13 episodes of `His &amp; Hers' and not a word of it is
mine,'' says Mull. ``It's just being an actor getting a job. I
always wondered if I had diminished my acting by wearing too many
hats.
   ``Television is really a writer's medium. A show will succeed or
fail on the quality of the writing. I feel in many sitcoms the
actors are interchangeable.''
   One thing that makes Mull funny is that he doesn't look like a
hip comedian. He looks more like an accountant.
   And in his passion for art, Mull's business-suit demeanor is in
stark contrast to the artist stereotype.
   ``My life is my art. I was trained for it,'' he says. ``We're
talking art. Slapping paint on canvas art.
   ``My work is in galleries in New York and Florida. The reason I
don't have a gallery here is I don't want to be considered a
celebrity painter, even though some are pretty good Sunday
painters.''
   As a performer, Mull first became known for his television role
on ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,'' then on ``Fernwood 2-Night'' and
``America 2-Night.'' His movies include ``Mr. Mom,'' ``My
Bodyguard,'' ``F.M.,'' ``Take This Job and Shove It,'' ``Clue'' and
``Painted Lips,'' which he wrote.
   He's also done television movies, specials and record albums.
His last series was ``Domestic Life,'' which lasted only six
episodes on CBS in 1984 but was listed by Time magazine as one of
the year's 10 best.
   He co-wrote, produced and acted in the TV comedy specials ``The
History of White People in America'' and its movie spinoff,
``Portrait of a White Marriage.''
   Mull was offered ``His &amp; Hers'' while working on a movie in Utah
called ``Ski Patrol.'' He says he and Ray Walston were the only
actors over the age of 21 in the movie, which he adds disappeared
from movie houses as fast as the melting snow.
   In ``His &amp; Hers,'' Mull and Faracy are a husband-and-wife team
of marriage counselors. It's his second marriage and he has a
15-year-old son, played by Blake Soper. The show also stars Richard
Kline as his best friend, a divorce lawyer.
   ``I'm Freudian and she's Jungian, so we have a conflict of
psychological styles,'' Mull says. ``Ostensibly, we're supposed to
have separate practices, but we seem to share patients and crises.
I guess `physician heal thyself' is the concept.''
   Mull recently sold his homes in Montecito and Hollywood and
bought a larger house in Brentwood. One reason he moved was to find
a better area for him and his wife, Wendy, a musician and composer,
to raise 4-year-old Maggie Rose.
   ``I've spent the last six months building a studio,'' he says.
``It's the first real studio I've had. I can write or paint. It's
got 14-foot ceilings and special lighting.
   ``I've also switched from airbrush to oils. I'm back to basics.
With an airbrush I always felt I was in medicine with that
stainless-steel tool in my hand.
   ``It's hard to describe the kind of painting I do. You know how
when you look at something you have a split second of perception.
That split second is what I'm trying to capture.''
   Mull says he gets his physical exercise by kicking a football
around, a pasttime he hopes to turn into a movie called ``End Over
End.''
   ``I said on a radio show that something I'd always wanted to do
was kick a field goal for the Cleveland Browns,'' says Mull, who
grew up in northern Ohio. ``I got a call from the Browns inviting
me to Cleveland. I suited up and kicked the ball, and I've been at
it since. Now I can kick my age in yards, which is 46.
   ``It's gotten into my blood and I've written this script about
an aging kicker. A producer has it and we're in the process of
getting studio backing. I hope I can do it before I'm too old.''

   John Steinbeck always turned down requests to
adapt for the stage ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' his epic novel about
Dust Bowl Okies and their migration to the Promised Land of
California.
   He loved the film version, starring Henry Fonda, which was
written by Nunnally Johnson and directed by John Ford, all three of
them his good friends. But he didn't want to see the story as a
play.
   ``I think John wondered if it would be visual in a theater,''
says Elaine Steinbeck, the writer's third wife and most ardent fan.
After he died in 1968, she continued to reject proposals for a
play, except for a local production at Actors Theater of Louisville
in the early 1980s.
   ``But the minute Steppenwolf asked me, I said `yes,''' adds
Steinbeck's widow, referring to the Chicago theater company that
has made a name for itself all over the world with its highly
kinetic, freewheeling productions.
   ``I knew their reputation and had seen `Orphans' in London and
`Balm in Gilead' in New York. They were professional, imaginative,
exciting and had sent their actors, directors and plays out into
the theatrical mainstream.
   ``I also knew that the 50th anniversary of the publication of
`The Grapes of Wrath' was going to come up last April _ the book
was first published in April 1939 _ and I felt, `Wouldn't that be a
wonderful time for somebody to do the play?'''
   The Steppenwolf version, adapted and directed by Frank Galati,
opened in Chicago in September 1988 and was done later in La Jolla,
Calif., and at the Royal National Theater in London. Now, it has
made the trek to Broadway, where it has found a house at the Cort
Theater.
   The book, the story of the Joad family and their journey
westward during the Great Depression, is known everywhere. In the
United States alone, in every one of those 50 years from 1939 to
1989, it has never sold fewer than 100,000 copies. It has been
published in 40 languages.
   ``Whenever anybody would say, `What's your favorite novel?' John
would say: `The one I've just finished.' But I think he had taste
enough to know that `The Grapes of Wrath' was his big book,'' says
Mrs. Steinbeck in a soft, Texas twang not erased by her more than
50 years in New York.
   Mrs. Steinbeck, one of Broadway's first female stage managers,
worked on such shows as the original ``Oklahoma!'' and ``Othello''
with Paul Robeson. She first met her future husband in 1949 when he
was collaborating with Elia Kazan on the movie ``Viva Zapata!'' and
doing research for a novel that eventually became ``East of Eden.''
   ``He was recently divorced, and told me, `I'm very disillusioned
and very unhappy.' He had two young boys and his wife divorced him.
And he said, `I don't want to ever love another woman or ever write
another book.' Well, look what happened.''
   The couple was married in 1950. They kept homes in New York and
in Sag Harbor on Long Island but traveled a lot _ particularly to
London and Italy. They made up for the time he was too poor to
travel.
   ``I once asked him, `When F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest
Hemingway and all those other writers were going to Paris, why
didn't you go?' He said: `I didn't have the price of a ticket. But
I'm glad I didn't because I stayed home and wrote about my own
people.'''
   Fans of the film version of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' will find a
different emphasis in the play, one that is much truer to the book,
Mrs. Steinbeck says.
   ``The movie was a star vehicle for Henry Fonda, who played Tom
Joad. It really ends when Tom leaves,'' she says.
   ``In the book, the central figure all the way through is Ma
Joad. They all leave her for one reason or another. Even Tom. And
she says: `We are the people. We must prevail. We must go on.' I
feel that's what Frank Galati was going for in the play.
   ``John didn't write many women's parts. As a matter of fact,
critics used to say, `Steinbeck writes better men than women.' He
would always look at me and say, `How about Ma Joad?'''
   During their years together, Steinbeck would write every day in
longhand, usually after sharpening three-dozen pencils, his widow
recalls. ``That was stalling,'' she says. If he was working on a
long book, Steinbeck would keep regular hours. But he would start
the morning writing letters.
   ``John always said writing letters was like a pitcher warming
up. He would write letters before he would write his work. Or when
we traveled, he wrote travel pieces. Just things that interested
him, not things that would live forever. He kept a journal for
every book.''
   When she first met him, one of the first things they did was to
drive to Salinas, Calif., where he was born, to see the little room
on the top floor of the house where he first started writing. ``I
can't remember a time when I didn't write,'' he told her as he
showed her the building.
   Steinbeck did a lot of research on ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' He
wrote a series of pieces called ``The Harvest Gypsies'' for a
now-defunct San Francisco newspaper and then realized it was a
book, not newspaper articles.
   ``He loved to think of himself as a journalist,'' Mrs. Steinbeck
says. ``I don't think he was accurate enough to be a journalist. He
always embroidered a bit. He'd always throw a little bit extra in.''
   ``When John won the Nobel Prize, he said, `I don't know whether
I deserve it or not, but I certainly am glad I got it,''' she
recalls.
   ``I don't think that John ever got fancy. When he became
successful, he didn't start writing a different kind of story. He
still wrote about the people he knew. John cared about the people.
He talked the same way to great French writers at the Academy
Francaise as he did to the fishermen at Sag Harbor. He never talked
down to anybody.''

<HEAD>NATO Nations Pare Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO members are responding to Eastern
Europe's political revolution by trimming their military budgets
and turning away from expensive joint weapons programs.
   Defense Minister Guy Coeme of Belgium rang NATO's alarm bells
recently by saying his country might withdraw its soldiers from
West Germany even before East-West agreement on reducing
conventional forces.
   Considering the startling changes in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact,
he asked, ``How can we justify the status quo on our side?''
   If West Germany drops out of the European Fighter Aircraft
project because of domestic opposition, which is possible, the
program probably would be doomed.
   Juergen Moellemann, the West German education minister, said the
fighter ``will be the safest airplane in the history of the
military because it will never fly, and therefore will not crash.''
   Relus ter Beek, defense minister of the Netherlands, said, ``A
reconsideration of the security situation in Europe is now
necessary.''
   There is a new feeling among Western allies that they can pare
their budgets, drop out of cooperative programs and bring their
soldiers home from West Germany.
   ``In all likelihood, ... spending will wither on the vine as
much as governments feel they dare,'' said John Cross, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London.
   Even the United States has abandoned big increases in spending.
Pentagon officials now feel able to talk about shutting down
military bases, withdrawing soldiers from West Germany and dropping
weapons programs.
   Other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are
eager to do the same, but some caution against moving too quickly.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain says the Soviet
Union will have ``vast military capabilities'' even after promised
force reductions.
   Denmark's defense minister, Gen. Joergen Lyng, finds
``developments in Eastern Europe ... so fluid that the situation
can change rapidly.''
   Governments are under pressure to economize, however, and
Somnath Sen of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
estimates military spending by the 16 NATO members will decline 2.7
percent this year from about $450 billion. He said it was off 1.1
percent last year, adjusted for inflation.
   The United States, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
total, probably will reduce spending by 3 percent this year and
European expenditures could decline slightly more than 2 percent,
Sen said.
   ``It will be difficult for defense ministers to ask for more''
in the new political climate, Sen predicted.
   Officials say few members will meet NATO's guideline of a 3
percent growth in spending this year. The target has been in effect
since the 1970s, and the alliance's defense ministers probably will
abolish it soon.
   Some countries may keep spending up because of regional
problems. Greece and Turkey, for instance, were enemies long before
they were NATO allies.
   Greece has exceeded the United States in the share of its
economic output devoted to defense. Last year, it spent 6 percent
of its gross national product on the military, the highest in NATO,
and greater than the 5.5 percent spent by the Americans, according
to alliance estimates.
   Turkey, one of only two NATO members bordering the Soviet Union,
also worries about neighbors Syria, Iraq and Iran. Its military,
now undergoing modernization, gets about a one-quarter of the
budget.
   Norway, the other NATO nation with a Soviet frontier, has
drafted plans to increase military expenditures by 2.5 percent this
year.
   Analysts say West Germany will be under great pressure to cut
defense spending so its powerful economy can help East Germany.
Bonn talks of reducing its army from 480,000 to 400,000 in the
1990s and has suspended a plan to increase the conscription term
from 15 months to 18.
   Military hardware is a major target of budget cutters because of
negotiations in Vienna, Austria, on reducing conventional forces in
Europe, which are expected to produce an agreement this year.
   ``Countries will for the first time be looking at actually
reducing the numbers of equipment they require. ... It's a new
environment for force planners,'' said Simon Lunn, deputy
secretary-general of the North Atlantic Assembly, made up of
legislators from NATO nations.
   Arms negotiators, for example, want to limit each side to 20,000
main battle tanks, long the dominant weapon in land combat.
   For the ``thinned-out battlefield'' of the future, governments
may place more emphasis on sophisticated mobile weapons, analysts
say.
   NATO members have begun pulling out of costly joint arms
programs set up years ago to produce modern weapons that could be
shared.
   ``Today, as defense budgets shrink, we see cooperative programs
running into severe difficulties,'' William H. Taft IV, the U.S.
ambassador to NATO, said in a recent speech.
   A senior alliance official, who agreed to discuss the situation
only if granted anonymity, said: ``We're in this indecisive period
now ... where to rush in to create new programs is probably not
wise. ... That's why all these countries are sort of retrenching on
the programs.''
   An eight-nation plan to develop the warship of the 1990s has
collapsed. Britain, France and Italy withdrew last fall, followed
in quick succession by West Germany, Spain and the Netherlands,
leaving only Canada and the United States.
   Britain and the United States have turned their backs on plans
to build a weapon that fighter planes could fire from a distance,
without flying over enemy territory. France and Canada got out
earlier.
   Spain, Italy and West Germany are considering whether to
continue, but one official said, on condition of anonymity: ``The
investment for research and development would be so significant
that it's not likely they will have the strength to carry it
themselves.''
   The United States dropped out of an eight-nation program to
develop special 155mm ammunition to seek out enemy armor. A few
years ago, it persuaded West Germany to stay in, officials said.
   Interest also is waning in a project to develop a family of
air-to-air missiles of short and medium range. West Germany said
last year it no longer would participate in building the
short-range version, leaving Britain, Canada and Norway.
   Spain, Italy, Britain and West Germany are in the European
Fighter Aircraft project, but continued German participation is in
question.
   Another major expense is stationing soldiers in West Germany,
the front line of the Western alliance.
   As part of a conventional arms treaty, the Soviet Union and the
United States plan to reduce their troop strength in Central Europe
to 195,000 soldiers each, with the United States allowed 30,000
more on NATO's flanks.
   That means the Soviets would remove 370,000 soldiers and the
United States would withdraw 80,000.
   Reductions in arms should allow other NATO members to call home
the soldiers who operate those weapons.

<HEAD>Behind a Business-As-Usual Facade, Britain Reviews its Defenses</HEAD>

   Officially, it's business as usual in Britain.
Behind the scenes, defense is under review.
   A new nuclear arsenal is being built on schedule, defense
spending is steady and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has not
abandoned the idea that West Germany should install new short-range
nuclear missiles.
   She remains the most outspokenly hawkish of the NATO leaders,
but official say she has quietly initiated a review of defense
policy and spending.
   In January, Mrs. Thatcher set up an informal group of four
Cabinet ministers, including herself, to consider the issue.
   ``There's an acceptance there will be change,'' said a senior
government source, who would talk about the matter only if not
quoted by name. But there is no sign of swift cuts and no talk of
dismantling Britain's independent nuclear arsenal, the source said.
   Britain reaffirmed in January it will replace its aging
submarine-based nuclear missiles with a $10 billion U.S. Trident
system, as planned, and military spending will remain at about 4
percent of gross national product through 1992.
   Mrs. Thatcher is resisting pressure for disarmament following
the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.
   ``We must keep up the level of our defenses, both conventional
and nuclear weapons, and not make changes until they are agreed
with NATO and at the `Conventional Forces in Europe''' arms
reduction talks in Vienna, Austria, she told Parliament in February.
   She was lukewarm about President Bush's proposal Jan. 31 to
reduce U.S. and Soviet forces in Central Europe to 195,000 soldiers
each.
   Opposition parties accuse her of trying to invent new threats or
fretting about the resurgence of old ones, like a united Germany.
   ``The British government, alone of governments in NATO and the
Warsaw Pact, seems actively to resent the challenge presented by
the ending of the Cold War,'' said Gerald Kaufman, foreign affairs
spokesman for the opposition Labor Party.
   Most Britons apparently share Mrs. Thatcher's caution about
turning tanks into tractors before the changes in Eastern Europe
are demonstrably here to stay.
   A National Opinion Poll in January indicated 63 percent believed
Britain should not reduce military spending despite the changes in
the Soviet bloc, and 76 percent felt Britain should retain at least
some nuclear weapons as long as the Soviets do.
   Defense analysts foresee a cut of up to one-third in the
155,000-member army, including the phased withdrawal of many of the
66,700 British soldiers in West Germany, the largest foreign
contingent after the Americans.
   ``The dismantling of most, if not all, of the British Army of
the Rhine before the end of the decade now looks probable,'' said
Henry Stanhope, defense writer for The Times of London.
   Other likely targets for cutbacks are the four-nation European
Fighter Aircraft project and the British-made Challenger 2 tank.
   Such cuts will cost jobs and could have a psychological effect
on a nation that, despite having lost an empire, still sees itself
as a middle-rank world power.
   Even The Daily Telegraph, a conservative paper that supports a
strong Britain, recognizes change must come.
   ``A review of Britain's continental commitment, the cornerstone
of defense policy since 1945, has become inevitable,'' it said in
an editorial. ``The Germans do not want us any more.''

<HEAD>Hoffman Focuses on Humanitarian Drive as Curtain Closes on Shylock</HEAD>

   Now that ``The Merchant of Venice'' has
concluded a successful Broadway run, Dustin Hoffman has two
priorities _ a rare family vacation and finding a bone marrow donor
for a terminally ill student.
   ``My wife told me a couple of weeks ago I haven't taken a week
off in five years. I'm going to take three weeks off, take a rest
with my family,'' said the two-time Academy Award-winner.
   ``Then I'll come back tenanciously and try to solve this.''
   ``This'' is a drive to locate a donor for leukemia victim
Allison Atlas, a 20-year-old business major at New York University
who was told in August she could expect to live six months unless
she gets a marrow transplant.
   Hoffman, 52, felt compelled to help after seeing Atlas, of
Bethesda, Md., on television. He donated a six-figure sum and made
public appeals for help. In the past, all of his humanitarian
efforts have been done in private.
   ``I became involved to get the public to know they can be
donors,'' the actor said in a recent interview.
   ``We're all inundated with monumental problems of the world,
people asking us to give to the disease of the week,'' he said.
``What makes this so special is here is someone who's saying, `If
you give me the money, I can find a donor and it can make the
difference for me.'
   ``It picked me. Sometimes you see someone and you sense that
she's the one person who would come to my aid if something happened
to me,'' Hoffman said. ``It's the person who's the most giving, the
most generous, the most courageous.''
   ``The Merchant of Venice'' concluded a prosperous 15-week
Broadway run on March 10 after getting a two-week extension. The
play was the hit of the London theater season during a 16-week
showing last summer, with Hoffman making his Shakespearean and
British stage debut in the role of Shylock, the vengeful Jew who
seeks his pound of flesh in return for an unpaid debt.
   The role brought different reactions in the two countries.
   ``New York is a different audience,'' Hoffman said. ``In London,
you're playing on a turf where they grew up on Shakespeare the way
you grew up on video games.
   ``They know how `The Merchant of Venice' ends. Here, they don't.
They keep watching to see what's going to happen. It's a more vocal
audience. They're probably closer to an Elizabethan audience.''
   The actor, wearing a double-breasted navy sportscoat and an open
collar shirt during a recent interview a few days before the final
performance, fidgeted with a gray-flecked beard as he spoke. The
whiskers would be shaved ``within 10 minutes of the curtain,''
Hoffman said with a laugh.
   Hoffman, winner of the 1979 Academy Award for best actor in
``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' repeated the feat last year in ``Rain Man''
for his sensitive portrayal of Raymond Babbitt, an autistic savant
institutionalized for social disorders but who was a whiz with
mathmetics. He was nominated for best actor four other times.
   ``Rain Man'' won him personal and financial rewards, but Hoffman
also relished the gratitude of those who work with austistic people.
   ``Sure, you want to entertain people and be rich and famous. But
at the same time, you want to alter perceptions or help them,'' he
said.
   ``The most gratifying thing about `Rain Man' was the letters. We
got letters from parents of kids and heads of organizations and
doctors who gave us awards and plaques for putting autism on the
map. It just took a lid off for some of these people,'' he said.
   In one case, a man who saw the movie called his autistic brother
just to see how he was doing. ``Nothing was more gratifying than
that,'' Hoffman said.
   The role of Raymond Babbitt evolved after Hoffman studied
several real-life cases of autism, including Joseph Sullivan of
Huntingdon, W.Va.
   ``There's the role that you're given and the role you create.
That was one that was created. It wasn't on the page. `Midnight
Cowboy' was written. The thing with `Tootsie' was a created role.
`The Graduate' was written,'' Hoffman said.
   ``I enjoy something working when we create it from the ground
up. Sometimes a critic comes to you and says, `Ah, it's easy to do
that.' It looks easy, but you got to create it.
   ``It took a year to find a prototype that you would build all
your stuff from, then to get it past doctors and get the story in
dramatic form without intruding on the illness. How do you get
sympathy for someone who doesn't want you around?''
   Tom Cruise, who co-starred with Hoffman in ``Rain Man'' but was
shut out in the Oscars, is nominated for best actor this year for
``Born on the Fourth of July.'' The movie's box-office appeal could
give Cruise a boost when the Oscars are presented March 26.
   ``It's very hard to predict,'' Hoffman said. ``The odds are
probably pretty good in the sense that the more popular the picture
the better the odds are that (the Academy members) have seen it.
   ``Someone like Daniel Day-Lewis who was nominated for `My Left
Foot' apparently has a much smaller audience.''

   Veterans of what they call The Movement returned
to Selma, Ala., last week on a journey that in some respects had
the flavor of a religious pilgrimage. For a reporter who covered
Bloody Sunday and the Selma-to-Montgomery march 25 years ago, the
memories came back with startling clarity.

   The city just put up a new historical marker
in a park alongside the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the blood-red banks
of the Alabama River.
   That must mean that it won't be long before what happened here
25 years ago will seem as distant and unreal as all those other
happenings duly noted in passing on fading historical markers
across America, snippets of history largely ignored. This new one
records ``Bloody Sunday'' and the ``Selma-to-Montgomery March.''
   What happened here was the battle of Selma. No, not the battle
of Selma when Yankee troops sacked the town and burned its
Confederate arsenal. That was in 1865. This battle of Selma was in
1965 and lasted 10 weeks.
   What was sacked in 1965 was an arsenal of inequality, a
systematic scheme to deny black Americans the right to vote. To the
victors, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ranks with the Emancipation
Proclamation on the scale of liberty.
   Veterans of that battle, graying soldiers of what they still
call, reverently, The Movement, returned last week from across the
nation on a journey that in some respects had the flavor of a
religious pilgrimage.
   They came to march in procession and to sing old hymns and to
embrace old friends and walk on old battlegrounds, some hard to
recognize now. And they came to convince a new generation of
blacks, who take the ballot for granted, that even after the
Selma-to-Montgomery march there remains a distance to travel.
   ``We are a long way from having our fair share of the American
pie economically and socially,'' said John Lewis, a returning
soldier from Atlanta. ``What better place to rededicate ourselves
to all that is left to do?''
   A billy stick fractured Lewis' skull at the Pettus Bridge on
Bloody Sunday. Now he is a congressman, a symbol of both the event
and its result.
   What better place indeed?
   ``Selma did more for the nation than Selma did for itself,''
Lewis said, referring to a current local racial dispute.
   Selma, then and now, is a city of about 27,000 people almost
equally divided racially, about 52 percent black. The issue then
was clear-cut, the right to vote. The issue now is less so. But it
seems that even after 25 years when disputes get hot in Selma the
sides line up according to race, often reluctantly on both sides.
   The dispute today is over the dismissal of the first black
school superintendent in Alabama.
   The school board that hired him, made up of six whites and five
blacks, voted not to renew his three-year contract. The vote was
six to five. The lines were drawn and lawmen were called to keep
order in the schools and at city hall.
   Selma 25 years ago became the national symbol of racial
intolerance. Even its two fishing ponds, side by side, were
racially segregated.
   Today Selma, of all places, qualifies at first look as a model
of racial harmony and integration. Blacks and whites work, live,
shop and worship side by side. Yet the city remains as racially
polarized as ever.
   Selma today is like a marigold, lovely to behold but with a
strange odor when you get up close.
   Lewis spoke on March 4 at the Brown Chapel AME Church, The
Movement's foremost shrine. It was built by former slaves and sons
of slaves and looks much as it did 25 years ago with its twin red
towers and worn oak pews, although two chinaberry trees that gave
shade outside are gone. Inside, its sweet musty smell of
deliverance remains.
   For those 10 weeks in 1965 that venerable sanctuary throbbed
with hymns of hope and courage and The Movement's anthem, ``We
Shall Overcome,'' and trembled to the oratory of Martin Luther King
Jr., whom many white Selmans back then called derisively ``de
Lawd.''
   Not long ago Joe Smitherman, who was Selma's mayor in 1965 and
remains so today, said from the pulpit of Brown Chapel: ``My hands
are as dirty as the others. I ordered the arrest of Dr. King. We
were wrong. I did it. I'm sorry.''
   Bloody Sunday was March 7, a dour and chilly day. About 600
blacks left Brown Chapel and crossed the Pettus Bridge. They aimed
to march to Montgomery, the state capital 54 miles away, to
petition Gov. George Wallace in person for the right to vote.
Wallace forbade the march.
   The hymn they sang at Brown Chapel that morning was ``Nobody
knows the trouble I've seen.''
   And nobody had. Nobody could have forseen the orgy of official
violence that turned back the marchers, state troopers with clubs
and tear gas and deputies on horseback with bullwhips.

   Americans by the hundreds, black and white, came to Selma in
outrage.
   For two weeks they camped outside Brown Chapel beneath the
chinaberry trees and on the dirt road in front, Sylvan Street. A
thick rope confined them to that street in Selma.
   Today, Sylvan Street has been renamed. It is now Martin Luther
King Jr. Street. ``It's the longest street sign in town,'' said
Smitherman grandly. The street is now paved, and lit, as are all
the streets in east Selma now, and there are no more outhouses in
the neighborhood, which were commonplace.
   In front of Brown Chapel, where the chinaberry trees used to be,
a bronze bust of King rests on a tall granite monument.
   So much of the Selma of '65 is gone, largely unmourned.
   A car dealership has replaced the Silver Moon Cafe. There, on
the sidewalk out front, one of those white sympathizers who came to
Selma, James Reeb, a minister from Boston, was bludgeoned to death
two days after Bloody Sunday. The night he lay dying a throng kept
candlelight vigil on Sylvan Street, all night, behind the rope, in
the rain.
   The whites-only Selma Del eatery on Broad Street, the main drag,
is gone. In its place stands _ are you ready? _ the Booker T.
Washington Insurance Co.
   Camp Selma is gone, too. It was once an old chain-gang camp long
abandoned and then revived in 1965. Sheriff Jim Clark, whose lapel
button said ``NEVER,'' arrested blacks by the hundreds when they
lined up in front of the courthouse to register to vote. Camp Selma
was where he imprisoned them.
   Camp Selma also accommodated the 3,000 Army regulars, Alabama
National Guardsmen and federal marshals sent to protect the
ultimate march, the victory march from Selma to Montgomery on March
21-25.
   The night before the march 4,000 people, the potential marchers
themselves, slept wherever they could find a place, some on church
pews, some on couches in the housing project across from Brown
Chapel, some on the Sylvan Street dirt rolled in blankets in a cold
wind under a waning three-quarter moon.
   Next morning, the first day of spring, they met at Brown Chapel,
prayed, sang and gathered at the river, at the Pettus Bridge, and
began a journey that seemed somehow biblical after all that had
gone before.
   Even the old highway, the route of the march, is not as it was.
It was called then the Jefferson Davis Highway, a two-lane road
most of the way to Montgomery. So the marchers' numbers were
reduced, by court decree, to 300 when they reached the two-lane
stretch in Lowndes County. The rest hoofed it back to Selma or
hitched rides with volunteer drivers in hired cars and buses.
   Today the Jefferson Davis Highway is simply Highway 80, a
divided four-lane motorway. The sharecropper shacks have vanished.
If the re-enactors of the march sipped no well water they at least
were cheered by meadowlarks and mockingbirds, which still abound
along the way.
   When the 1965 march reached the outskirts of Montgomery its
numbers again swelled to 4,000, then to 10,000, to 20,000, and on
the next afternoon to at least 25,000.
   They marched past a street now, but not then, named Rosa Parks
Avenue, named for the black woman who refused to move to the back
of a Montgomery bus.
   They marched up Dexter Avenue past the church where Martin
Luther King Jr. was pastor, the man who agreed reluctantly to take
up Mrs. Parks' cause, to eventually become the charismatic head of
what became The Movement.
   And on they marched to the steps of the building where Jefferson
Davis took the oath of office as president of the Confederacy, and
where, on that day, King exhorted the great congregation of
pilgrims in his measured cadences to keep on, keep on.
   ``How long? Not long, because truth pressed to earth shall rise
again.''
   That night, the worst happened after the protecting federal army
had departed. Ku Klux Klan nightriders shot Viola Liuzzo of
Detroit, white, one of the volunteer shuttle drivers, shot her dead
in her car in the Big Swamp area of Lowndes County. She was The
Movement's 11th martyr.
   No historical marker commemorates the spot where she died. But
somebody, nobody seems to know who, sees to a floral wreath nearby,
hanging on a fence.
   It is there today.

   Edith Stricoff once loved to dance and to
travel, but now cannot even brush her teeth on her own.
   Her husband, Bernard, cleans house, cooks, does laundry, bathes
his wife and helps her use a commode in a corner of the living
room, where a hospital bed contrasts with colorful Peruvian
weavings from a vacation a dozen years ago.
   Stricoff, 65, said he cares for his 64-year-old wife up to 20
hours a day, on call even through the night, when a groan from
downstairs will rouse him to see if she's cold or her arm is stuck
under her body. For four hours a day, he has hired help.
   People sometimes suggest a nursing home. They say Edith
Stricoff, former bookkeeper and mother of three, is a burden at her
advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease.
   But Stricoff hums old songs the couple once danced to and
sometimes thinks she murmurs his name as he hugs her in the morning.
   ``You don't throw an injured child out of the house because the
child is injured,'' he said. ``Why should I do that to my wife?''
   A growing number of men are caring for aging and infirm wives,
parents and other relatives, according to a study by Lenard W. Kaye
and Jeffrey S. Applegate, professors at the Graduate School of
Social Work and Social Research at Bryn Mawr College in suburban
Philadelphia.
   ``Men's roles as caregivers have traditionally been minimized,
if not virtually dismissed, by the professional and lay public
alike,'' they write in their study.
   Although women comprise two-thirds to three-fourths of an
estimated 7 million caregivers nationwide, a significant number of
men ``have been willing to commit a substantial portion of their
lives, both in time and effort, to this challenging task,'' the
researchers said.
   More men are doing so largely because women are stretched to the
limit by careers, other family demands and the rising number of
elderly, the researchers say. Other factors include men's changing
attitudes toward family and cuts in governmental aid for elder
care, they say.
   Kaye said in an interview the study was intended to address the
special needs of male caregivers.
   ``In no way are we trying to cancel out the dominant role _ no
question it's a dominant role _ played by women,'' he said. ``We
just believe that they cannot keep up at this rate. We need to be
able to turn and be willing to consider alternative routes to take
when we talk about family caregiving.''
   The study is based on surveys of 152 leaders of caregiver
support groups and 148 male participants in such groups across the
nation. The research, supported by a grant from the Andrus
Foundation of the American Association of Retired Persons, also
included in-depth interviews with 30 male caregivers and nine
elderly recipients in the Philadelphia region and surveys of a
26-member national expert panel.
   Seven of eight men in the study considered themselves primary
caregivers, and more than a third were sole care providers. Only 20
percent said they were helped by more than two relatives. Four of
five cared for people with Alzheimer's, the progressive brain
disorder that causes premature senility.
   The men often continued to work while providing care and
resisted joining support groups, preferring to ``go it alone'' or
fearing participation would be an admission of failure.
   In general, the men felt most competent at such tasks as paying
bills, taking people to doctors and helping with telephoning and
letter-writing. They felt least competent at helping with grooming,
bathing and dressing.
   The study is limited by its size and by the fact that caregivers
surveyed were primarily white, married men over age 60, living with
and caring for wives, and relatively secure financially. Minority
and low-income men tend less than white, middle-class men to join
the support groups from which the sample was drawn, Kaye said.
   Eloise Rathbone-McCuan, professor of social welfare at the
University of Kansas, said she had not seen any evidence of an
increasing number of men providing elder care. But she agreed that
``the demographics of women and aging will force men to be
confronted with many new roles,'' especially caregiving.
   Robyn Stone, a research fellow at the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research,
said the study could help draw more attention to caregiving in
general, which has often been viewed as a women's issue. ``From a
political perspective, since it's still primarily a man's world,
there may be more of a serious focus on this problem,'' she said.
   Kaye and Applegate said their results indicate support groups
should reach out more to men, who otherwise may end up enduring too
much of the burden and allowing their own health to deteriorate.
Advertisements for support groups should include more men and
emphasize such practical topics as legal issues, finding home
health care, stages of Alzheimer's disease and information on
government benefits, they said.
   ``Men are probably going to hesitate getting involved in a group
if you play up too strongly the emotional payoff, the benefits of
sharing experiences,'' Kaye said.
   Stricoff, who prided himself on being able to work things out
himself as his wife grew more ill, resisted joining a support group
sponsored by the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders
Association at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.
   ``I said, `Why do I have to go to a group for? Sit there and
listen to them. What are they going to tell me? I'm living with the
damn thing. I know what it is,''' Stricoff said.
   But his children and other relatives kept after him. ``And I
went, and surprisingly enough, it was fulfilling,'' he said.
   Now he tries not to miss monthly meetings, because of the tips
he picks up on ways to help his wife and the moral support.
   ``It's not that misery likes company,'' he said. ``That's just
not the story. It makes you talk about things that you don't
usually talk about.''
   Stricoff said he provides most of his wife's care and does most
of the household tasks by himself, although the couple's children,
who are grown and live in the Philadelphia suburbs and Florida,
call regularly and help on weekends.
   A woman employed by a home health-care firm also comes in four
hours a day to give Stricoff a break and allow him to maintain his
accounts as a hosiery salesman for a Dallas company.
   Some friends also have stayed close.
   The support makes it easier to bear his wife's helplessness.
   He must stroke her cheeks to get her to chew and cleans her
daily with a washcloth from head to toe. But when people ask him
why he doesn't complain, he asks what there is to complain about.
   ``You've got to remember how my wife would have reacted had I
been in that situation,'' he said. ``I honestly feel she would
probably do as much as she physically can for me, which is what I'm
doing for my wife. I do it because of my love for her.''

   Medicare's catastrophic health-care program is
history, but its legacy lingers in this year's tax forms.
   Congress didn't kill the year-old medical program until after
the Internal Revenue Service had sent the 1989 tax returns to the
printer, so forms 1040 and 1040A contain instructions for payment
of a seniors-only catastrophic surtax that doesn't exist.
   The catastrophic question is a one-year quirk in the income tax
picture that bodes well for senior citizens, but several other
continuing provisions in federal law also help to make tax time a
little less taxing for the elderly.
   These provisions, which include a higher standard deduction and
more liberal filing requirements for the elderly, mean many people
must reacquaint themselves with the tax code when they turn 65,
even if they've been doing their own taxes for decades.
   ``Many older taxpayers are unfamiliar with the special
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which become available to
them when they reach age 65,'' the House Aging Committee said in
its annual tax guide for older Americans.
   In addition to benefits that automatically become available at
age 65, other changes in the tax-filing routine occur as older
Americans mrity benefits, and rules for pension and annuity income.
   The IRS also offers free tax-preparation help to the elderly
through two programs _ Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax
Counseling for the Elderly. People can call the taxpayer service
number listed in their tax package or in the telephone book to find
out where to get assistance.
   Volunteers in both programs can help people prepare simple tax
forms, although the latter is specifically targeted toward the
needs of the elderly. Tax Counseling for the Elderly is jointly
sponsored by the IRS and the American Association of Retired
Persons, which provides 30,000 trained counselors to assist more
than 1.5 million older taxpayers a year with federal and state tax
forms.
   The program also serves more than 47,000 shut-ins who cannot
visit tax assistance sites.
   ``We find a lot of people who are intimidated by the form
itself,'' said AARP's Patty Hoath. ``We also find people who
perhaps have not been in a situation to do the tax form in the
past, such as someone who is newly widowed.''
   Others need help dealing with tax issues they haven't faced in
the past, such as taxation of Social Security benefits or
interpretation of pension benefit statements, Ms. Hoath said.
   The IRS has notified senior citizens that because the
catastrophic surtax was repealed, they should ignore Line 54 on
Form 1040 and Line 23 on Form 1040A. Anyone who made extra
estimated tax payments during 1989 to cover the catastrophic surtax
will receive a refund of their overpayments.
   ``We have tried to get the word out that even though the line
appears on the tax form, the provision no longer exists,'' said IRS
spokesman Steve Pyrek. ``Some people, no matter what, will include
information on that line of the return.''
   The repeal of the supplemental Medicare premium affects about 40
percent of the elderly, who would have paid $22.50 for every $150
of federal income tax liability. About 6 percent would have paid
the maximum amount of $800 per person.
   Congress repealed the catastrophic program in November under
pressure from higher-income senior citizens, many of whom already
had duplicate private coverage and who said the expanded government
medical benefits weren't worth the price tag.

<HEAD>New Day Care Center Supervises Young and Old</HEAD>

   As the American population ages amid a
mini baby boom, an increasing number of parents must care for
grandmother as well as bring up baby _ and juggle full-time jobs.
   To help families caught in that triple bind, Stride Rite Corp.
has opened what company officials say is the nation's only
inter-generational day care center.
   Karen Leibold, director of the center at the company's
headquarters, hopes it will become the kind of place where working
parents can drop off their children and elderly relatives in the
morning and know they will have been fed, entertained, educated and
cared for when they pick them up in the evening.
   The fourth floor of the shoe-manufacturing company has been
remodeled to accommodate up to 55 children and 24 older people. The
program is open both to the 500 Stride Rite employees in Cambridge
and community residents.
   The weekly fee for elderly care is $140. Child care fees range
from $130 to $170 a week.
   On a recent visit to the center, 4-year-olds were being dressed
for a winter walk, toddlers were puzzling over a talking toy and a
group of very excited youngsters was getting a cooking lesson.
``We're making play dough,'' one cried out.
   At the other end of the floor, in a sunny room affectionately
dubbed ``the library,'' a grandmother was relaxing on a couch and
talking with a staff member. ``It's nice in here,'' she said,
glancing around the room that will eventually have additional
ottomans and living-room lamps. ``It's comfortable.''
   Stride Rite was already a corporate pioneer in providing day
care for its employees when a newspaper article on the dilemma of
families caught between caring for elderly relatives and children
caught the attention of Chairman Arnold Hyatt about three years ago.
   He immediately wrote a memo to the director of the company's day
care program saying the company should create a program for the old
as well as the young.
   A survey of Stride Rite employees found about 25 percent were
caring for an elderly relative and an additional 13 percent
expected to do so in the future. Leibold said these figures
mirrored national trends.
   She said the study also indicated that a ``daughter track''
existed as well as the ``mommy track.'' Mommy track refers to the
course many females take when they juggle jobs and child care.
Leibold said National Council on Aging studies found that most care
givers for the elderly are women who then may be forced to limit
the time devoted to a career.
   The result of the survey and Hyatt's memo was a $700,000
investment by Stride Rite in designing 8,500 square feet of space
into groups of rooms for children and the elderly, with
administrative offices and dining facilities in between.
   Painted in purple, teal and apricot, the center is designed to
create a feeling of comfort and cheer, to look like ``grandmother's
front porch,'' rather than an institution or even a corporate
office, Stride Rite spokeswoman Deborah Singer said.
   At one end of the floor is an area set aside for the elderly. It
includes an arts and crafts area and the ``library'' designed to
look ``like someone's living room,'' Leibold said.
   The other end of the floor has classrooms for ages 2 through 5,
all furnished with miniature furniture, splotchy watercolors and a
scattering of dolls and wooden blocks.
   The dining area, shared by both groups, has adult-size tables
and chairs and child-size tables and chairs. A long counter,
featuring a sink, a hot pad and adjustable chairs, will provide
facilities for the adults to cook and the children to learn to cook.
   ``What we've done is encourage interaction between children and
the elderly and ensure the privacy of each group,'' Leibold said.
   From 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. both groups have supervised
activities, meals, crafts and exercise programs _ sometimes
together. Leibold hopes this will help to ``get rid of stereotypes
that old people and young people have about each other.''
   The program is designed for elderly who do not need extensive
medical attention, but require general supervision for daily
activities. Only two are currently at the center, and Leibold said
the company is working to inform employees and the community of the
elderly program.
   Stride Rite was one of the first companies to open its own day
care center in 1971, and Leibold hopes the inter-generational
center will be a model for other such centers.
   Singer said the facility hopes to provide its elderly with
meaningful activities. A computer will be installed, and Singer
hopes that one day the seniors could produce a newsletter for the
center. The company is working with Wheelock College and the
Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services organization to develop elderly
programs.
   ``Families are very stressed today,'' Leibold said. ``Fewer and
fewer families are living within close contact with each other.''
   The new center will ``help bring the generations together,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Charlie Tucker _ Selling Fuller Brushes at 90</HEAD>

   The figures on his order pad are
harder to make out these days, his hearing aids can turn
conversations into shouting matches, and he doesn't go anywhere
without a cane.
   But at 90, Charlie Tucker is still doing what he does best,
peddling mops and dusters, can openers and furniture polish _ just
about anything you might need.
   And if he doesn't get around quite as good as he used to, he
still knows how to move Fuller brushes.
   ``Your wife might be able to use this,'' he says, opening a box
in his dining room and pulling out a mop head that looks kind of
like Raggedy Ann as a blonde.
   ``It's regularly $5, but we've got it on special for just $3.99.
Oh, you're not married?'' Tucker hardly misses a beat. ``Well, how
about your mom?''
   Tucker has been selling household products for Fuller Brush for
59 years, and if you live in this part of the country, he's
probably tried to entice you with a free spatula or vegetable brush.
   ``I just love sales work, I reckon,'' says Tucker, a tidy,
compact man whose perfect white hair may be a byproduct of decades
of making a good first impression.
   Mrs. Eugene Collins, 61, of Chattanooga, has known Tucker since
she was a teen-ager and figures she's probably bought about every
product Fuller has ever made.
   ``I'm still using them. I love them, and I think Mr. Tucker has
been a part of that because he is so knowledgeable and tells you
how to do it and how to use them.''
   Tucker got his start at age 12, selling dynamite and doing odd
jobs at a company store in the Virginia coal fields. After World
War I, he hawked newspapers on trains, then worked as a buyer of
piece goods and women's ready-to-wear garments.
   But in 1931, his employer went out of business, and Tucker found
himself in the Great Depression with a wife and children but no job.
   So he answered an ad for Fuller Brush, and went to work in
Elizabethton, selling $150 worth of goods his first week. Within a
few weeks, that was his daily total, earning him the
congratulations of company founder Alfred C. Fuller and a promotion
to branch manager in Memphis.
   He took a similar job in Chattanooga in 1934, managing as many
as 35 salesmen until Fuller Brush was sold in the 1960s to
Consolidated Foods Inc. of Chicago.
   The new owners decided to eliminate the district offices, and
Tucker decided to return to the sidewalks.
   ``I was back where I started,'' he said. ``I was too old to go
out and hunt a new job, but I figured I could sell Fuller brushes.''
   Over the last 20 years, Tucker has been a familiar figure on
Chattanooga streets, often using a mop handle to prop open the
trunk of his portable warehouse, a 1968 Plymouth Fury.
   He's found himself thrust into roles of marriage counselor and
baby sitter, and he's had a door slammed in his face so hard the
glass shattered.
   ``I've been insulted and everything else, but I put my high
feelings in the closet and lock the door, because I would have had
them hurt if I'd taken everything seriously,'' he said.
   But Tucker took his co-workers seriously.
   Jim Clayton, 72, worked for Fuller Brush for 47 years. One day,
he said, he and Tucker were in Dayton, Tenn., and Tucker told him
to go to Bryan College, saying the maintenance department probably
needed a dozen brooms.
   ``Well, I walked to the boiler room and the guy said, `Hello,'
and I said, `I'm the Fuller Brush man,' and he said, `Bring me a
dozen brooms. Now if I'd been Charlie Tucker, I'd have said, `You
catch these customers down here and I'll go tend to that (college).
No use kidding myself. But that's just the kind of guy Charlie
Tucker always was.''
   When Tucker went to work in 1931, the company offered about a
dozen items. Now, there are 400 products and 13,000 sales
representatives, all of whom still work strictly on commission.
   It's the kind of challenge Tucker likes.
   ``We're selling one day, and I'm on this porch and he's on the
porch next door,'' Clayton said. ``And this lady comes to the door,
and she don't want to buy. And he said, `Well, I understand. But
when you see your neighbors using our specials, I want to remember
you had a chance to turn it down. I'll just step in and show it to
you.' And he stepped in and then stepped out in about three minutes
with a nice order.''
   ``I've never yet found a door that I'd hesitate to knock on,
whether it's the governor's or whoever's,'' Tucker said with a
grin. ``I'm no high-pressure salesman, but maybe I'll try to create
a desire sufficient to overcome your resistance.''
   These days, Tucker relies mostly on telephone sales by his wife,
Neoma, and on repeat customers who pick up their goods at his home
in north Chattanooga.
   He hasn't driven since last summer, when he underwent
complicated heart and kidney surgery, but after nearly 60 years,
it's hard to kick the habit.
   He's feeling better, and his eyes light up at the mention of
spring.
   ``If I get anywhere back to normal, I'll be back knocking on
doors.''

<HEAD>Researchers Want to See if Laughter Really Is the Best Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers will try to determine if
laughter really is the best medicine by showing comic films to
about 150 nursing home residents in the Carolinas.
   The study will use films such as those by the Marx brothers and
W.C. Fields to see whether humor reduces requests for
non-prescription pain medication, said Fran McGuire, head of the
project.
   ``If this kind of thing is true, it would be a tremendous tool
for activity directors'' in nursing homes and other group settings,
McGuire said.
   A small-scale film study by the department two years ago found
what appeared to be ``dramatic decreases'' in requests for pain
medication, he said. That could have been the result of chemical
changes in the body relieving pain or the result of reduced stress,
which would reduce pain.
   However, McGuire said that study was so limited that no
conclusive findings could be documented. The new study will attempt
to broaden the scope and come up with findings that could be used
by nursing homes to improve their residents' quality of life, he
said.
   In addition to the quantitative measure of pain medication, the
study also will try to measure the residents' happiness through a
written test.
   In addition to classic comic movdistribution of a
deceased person's property, according to a report by a senior
citizens group.
   Probate, also called estate administration, is the process by
which the debts of someone who has died are paid and the deceased's
remaining property is distributed to the rightful owners.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said its study of
900 probate cases in California, Delaware and Wisconsin found that
attorney fees sometimes exceeded 20 percent of the value of the
property and some estates took more than a year to settle. Cases in
which the deceased person had a will sometimes took just as long to
settle as those without a will, it said.
   ``With redundant reporting and notice requirements, and flexible
`deadlines' that are often unenforced or ignored, probate
frequently lasts more than a year,'' the report said.
   It said the three states where cases were studied were
indicative of problems across the country, and it estimated probate
fees could cost $2 billion or more each year nationally.
   ``For the estates of the middle class, attorney and personal
representative fees can deplete the assets by as much as 10 percent
even in uncomplicated cases,'' the report said.
   AARP recommended that states adopt simple, less costly probate
procedures.
   ``Probate as generally practiced in the United States is an
anachronism,'' the report said. ``Probate's procedures and
protections, even with recent reforms, are inappropriate for all
but the most exceptional cases.''
   Horace Deets, AARP's executive director, said probate is largely
an older's person's issue.
   ``Many of these older consumers who want to leave their property
with their loved ones have no idea how legal fees can affect their
intended gifts,'' Deets said.

<TEXT>
   Estate planning and postmortem planning make most
people squirm.
   Many of us avoid making a will or setting a plan for disposition
of assets upon our death for two simple reasons: We are uneasy with
the thought that we will die, and we feel that our estates are too
small to justify the time and expense involved in preparing a will.
   Regardless of the size of your estate or your philosophy on
death, estate planning and postmortem planning involve everything
you have worked for during your life _ and ensure that your wishes
will be followed should you become incapacitated or die.
   There are five important reasons for making a will: You can
choose your donees, minimize taxes, appoint a guardian, name an
executor and establish a domicile.
   In the absence of a will, up to half a married person's property
usually will be distributed to the surviving spouse, with the
remainder passing to the deceased's children. Only if the deceased
had adopted the spouse's children from a previous marriage would
those children be included in the distribution of property.
   Even though this distribution of property may not be consistent
with your wishes, you have no recourse. By failing to prepare a
will, you have abdicated the right to select your beneficiaries,
and what and how much each beneficiary is to receive.
   A properly prepared will can help to alleviate any tax liability
that might be levied against your estate. Taxable estates valued at
less than $600,000 are exempt from federal estate tax, but ``hidden
resources'' _ life insurance policies naming the decedent as the
insured, or qualified retirement plan benefits and IRAs can swell
the estate's value, oftentimes making it subject to federal estate
taxation. Trusts and other techniques available through your will
can lessen this tax burden.
   If you have children, perhaps your greatest concern is who would
take care of them if both you and your spouse died. A will can be
used to name a guardian. Courts generally will accommodate the
wishes of the parents in cases where a guardian is named.
   Without a will, you have no say in who carries out the
administration of your estate. If no will exists, the court will
appoint an administrator. And the court could appoint a creditor
(They sometimes qualify for this position), which would not
necessarily be in the best interests of your estate. By naming an
executor, you can ensure that a trustworthy person of your choosing
will handle the administration of your estate.
   Finally, for tax and other reasons, you may want to establish a
particular state as your state of domicile, or legal residence. For
example, if you have moved frequently, or have homes in more than
one state, each state could claim you as a resident and subject the
estate to multiple probate proceedings and overlapping claims to
state death or inheritance taxes. To minimize that risk, indicate
clearly in your will which state you claim as domicile.
   Experts agree that many people fail to recognize the importance
of a will. A person who dies ``intestate,'' without a will, can
leave many problems for loved ones and greatly reduce the chances
that undocumented intentions will be carried out. The solution for
everyone _ no matter the size of the estate _ is to have a will
prepared now and alleviate some of the uncertainties and problems
that could arise later.

   American Express Co. said it would buy all the
common stock in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. that it doesn't already
own and had ended talks with third parties about possible changes
in ownership of the troubled brokerage.
   The move culminates months of effort by American Express to
shore up Shearson's finances and indicates the travel and financial
services company has abandoned hopes of reducing its exposure to
the volatile securities industry.
   ``These actions affirm American Express's long-term commitment
to Shearson Lehman Hutton and its customers, and to working with
its management team,'' James D. Robinson III, chairman and chief
executive of American Express, said in a statement Sunday.
   American Express will buy out the minority stake in Shearson
through a stock swap valued at $350 million, Shearson spokesman
Lawrence Armour said. That brings the total amount American Express
has invested in Shearson in recent months to well over $1 billion.
   Shearson expanded rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s to
become the nation's second-largest brokerage, but its recent
struggles to cope with a downturn in the securities business have
led to thousands of layoffs and turmoil in its management ranks.
   American Expreses first moved to strengthen its grip last month
by ousting chairman and chief executive Peter A. Cohen, the man who
guided the firm's explosive growth, and replacing him with Howard
L. Clark Jr., American Express' chief financial officer.
   As a result of a review led by Clark, ``We are confident that
Shearson Lehman Hutton can be returned to levels of profitability
that will maintain its position as a premier company in the
securities industry,'' Robinson said.
   In the same statement Clark said, ``This vote of confidence from
American Express gives us the support we will need to implement the
findings of our strategic review and achieve successful performance
levels as a leader in the securities industry.''
   Shearson has been searching for capital to avoid a threatened
downgrading of its credit rating, which could increase its costs by
forcing it to pay higher interest rates on its borrowings.
   At the same time, American Express had been seeking to reduce
its 61 percent stake in Shearson to less than half to remove the
firm from its balance sheet and reduce its exposure to Wall
Street's sharp profit swings. A sharp drop in Shearson's share
price forced it to abandon that plan, though.
   Last week, American Express said it would increase its ownership
by an unspecified amount by injecting $750 million into the
brokerage. In December, American Express injected $250 million into
Shearson.
   American Express had held talks recently about a possible merger
of Shearson with Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
brokerage unit, but the company said last week it had terminated
discussions.
   American Express may have decided to buy out minority
stockholders now because Clark's appointment has given the company
control of Shearson's management, said Perrin Long, who follows the
securities industry for Lipper Analytical Services.
   ``This is the first time American Express has been in the
catbird seat since it acquired Shearson back in 1981,'' he said.
   As part of a tax-free merger of one of its subsidiaries with
Shearson, American Express plans to exchange 0.426 of its common
shares for each outstanding common share in Shearson. Based on
Friday's closing prices of $29.37{ for American Express and $12.50
for Shearson, the swap values the minority stake at $350 million.
   ``They probably think this is a reasonable time to go in and buy
the stock back'' because of the recent drop in Shearson's share
price, Long said.
   American Express also said it was considering adding to its own
equity capital through either a public or private offering of
stock. No decisions have been made yet about the timing or size of
any offering, said Armour, the spokesman.
   The latest move should help Shearson by removing the uncertainty
that has dogged the firm since American Express first said it
intended to reduce its stake, Long said.
   ``I think it would be a healthy thing because once you stop the
talk everybody can get down to business,'' he said.
   Sunday's announcement doesn't affect Nippon Life Insurance Co.'s
holding of 13 million shares of convertible voting preferred stock,
which gives it a voting stake of about 13 percent in Shearson.
   Like other Wall Street houses, Shearson has been beset by a
downturn in merger activity, securities underwriting and sluggish
stock and bond trading since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Shearson announced last week it would lay off 2,000 workers to
reduce its costs by about $400 million a year, and it left open the
prospect of still more job cuts. The brokerage dropped 800 workers
late last year.
   The announced layoffs would reduce Shearson's work force to
33,500 from a peak of 46,000 in January 1988.
   Shearson reported 1989 earnings of $110 million, up from $96
million a year earlier, but a third of the profits came from the
sale of a money management unit. Investment banking revenue, which
includes merger advising and securities underwriting, was down 27
percent.

<HEAD>Panel To Hear Arguments On New U.S. Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel is to decide in April whether an American
law banning the import of undersized lobsters violates the Free
Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada.
   The panel, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the dispute
today, is to recommend a resolution in mid-May that could range
from leaving the law as it is to banning it altogether. The board
of three Americans and two Canadians could also call for a
compromise.
   ``Lobster fishing is the backbone of hundreds of coastal
communities in Canada. Millions and millions of dollars in lost
income are at stake,'' said John Kearney, who represents the
Maritime Fishermen's Union in Nova Scotia.
   Bob Brown, director of the Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers
Association, said the dispute is ``on everybody's lips on both
sides of the border.''
   At issue is a bill that President Bush signed into law in
December, prohibiting the importation or interstate transportation
of lobsters that do not meet federal minimum-size standards.
   Lobsters that are shorter than 3\ inches from the eye socket to
where the tail begins are illegal under the new law. By 1992, the
minimum legal size will be 3 5-16 inches.
   But in Canada, lobster fishermen can catch lobsters 1-16th of an
inch shorter than those allowed in the United States.
   Lobstermen, dealers and industry observers throughout New
England and the Canadian Maritime provinces say the panel's
decision could have a major impact on the industry.
   ``It could change the way lobsters are marketed,'' and more
significantly might change the way the government regulates lobster
management, said University of Southern Maine Professor Charles
Colgan, a former state economist.
   Canadian officials argue that the law is purely a trade barrier
that violates the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. They say their
country has plenty of conservation laws, and the United States has
no right to tell them how to manage their resources.
   American lobstermen have complained to Congress that they could
not compete against the smaller, less expensive Canadian lobsters,
which were being shipped to American markets. The new law barring
the smaller lobsters could mean a potential loss to Canada of $20
million to $30 million in exports each year.
   American officials maintain that the law will protect the
lobster population by allowing more lobsters to live long enough to
reproduce.
   The new law as written will help American dealers protect their
domestic markets, but it also could lead to the loss of foreign
markets, industry sources say.
   Maine dealers previously could buy smaller lobsters from Canada
and pack them for shipment to out-of-state markets. The new law
prohibits that practice, and Maine and New England exporters are
making changes to adapt to the law.
   The board hearing the dispute could call for a compromise that
would allow imports only to American export companies or only
during certain times of the year, or to place quotas on undersize
lobster imports.
   The panel's decision would not be binding, but both countries
are obligated to honor it under provisions of the Free Trade
Agreement.
   It is only the second time since the Free Trade Agreement was
enacted on Jan. 1, 1989 that a panel has convened to resolve a
trade dispute.

   Exactly one year after 8,000 machinists walked
off the job at Eastern Airlines, several hundred union members and
supporters rallied at La Guardia Airport to remember the strikers.
   Vowing solidarity, representatives of dozens of unions stood
Sunday in a cold, windy parking lot outside a Continental hangar.
   ``We're here to show the public that we're still on strike and
we'll stay on strike for dignity in the workplace,'' said LeRoy
Washington, general chairman of the machinists' union, ``and to
tell people not to fly Eastern and Continental.''
   The demonstration in New York coincided with others in other
cities on Sunday.
   ``It hasn't been the kind of strike we wanted,'' Washington
added, ``but today we celebrate the solidarity of the Eastern
strikers. We're not going to give up.''
   Eight thousand members of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers struck over a new contract on
March 4, 1989. Texas Air wanted the union to take a pay cut, change
workplace rules and allow some work to be contracted out.
   ``It's great to have the support of so many unions,'' said Pete
Voccola, a union vice president and the strike coordinator at La
Guardia, who was still optimistic. ``We hope to either go back to
work or put Frank Lorenzo out of business.''
   ``The airline is losing $2 million a day at a time when the rest
of the industry is doing well,'' he said. ``So there's still a
possibility of getting our jobs back. We feel it's salvageable.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo was invited to the rally. Robert Gollnick,
state deputy labor commissioner, came in his place.
   ``The governor's commitment to these people is still strong,''
said Gollnick. ``But this is a federal issue and the federal
government should be doing something.''
   The atmosphere at the rally was not desperate, but demonstrators
expressed frustration and anger towards Lorenzo, president of Texas
Air, the parent company of Eastern and Continental Airlines.
   ``There are no kind words for him,'' said Washington. ``The
injustice at Eastern Airlines was created by Lorenzo. Hundreds of
hard-working men and women have lost their homes and their
standards of living because of this man.''
   ``The man is devoid of any principles,'' added Ed Cleary, the
New York State president of the AFL-CIO.
   The union claims Lorenzo deliberately drained Eastern's
resources to build a non-union airline.
   Most people at the rally wore anti-Lorenzo buttons and displayed
anti-Lorenzo signs. There were several chants of ``Down With
Lorenzo.''
   Other speakers called for President Bush to intervene in the
year-old dispute and show support for union members in the United
States.
   ``Mr. President, all over Eastern Europe, labor has risen up to
lead their countries to freer societies,'' said George Poulin, vice
president of the machinists' union for the Northeast U.S. ``You
embraced them and promised to assist them, and rightfully so. But
there's another eastern conflict _ Eastern Airlines. It's time to
embrace the Eastern strikers like you embraced Lech Walesa.''

<HEAD>Fruit of the Loom to Build Two Plants in Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruit of the Loom Inc. said
Monday it would invest $93 million to build two plants in
economically depressed Northern Ireland.
   The Northern Ireland Office said the plants will employ up to
500 people in the province, which has an unemployment rate of 14
percent, the highest in Britain.
   Fruit of the Loom's investment is the single largest new
American investment in Northern Ireland in 10 years, it said.
   Fruit of the Loom, the largest producer in the United States of
men and boys' underwear, said it would build a plant in Londonderry
to spin yarn for its leisure wear plants in nearby County Donegal
in the Irish Republic. A second plant, to be built later, will
manufacture sweatshirts, it said.
   William Farley, chairman and president of Chicago-based Fruit of
the Loom, said in a statement that the new plant ``will make it
possible for our garment plants to access quickly supplies of the
different yarn needed for particular garments.''
   In the past, Fruit of the Loom has had to send yarn from the
United States to supply its plants in Donegal, where 1,700 people
are employed making T-shirts and sweatshirts for the European
market. That could take up to five weeks.
   Richard Needham, Northern Ireland's economy minister, said the
project, backed by the Industrial Development Board, would provide
250 jobs by 1992 with the rest to follow by 1995.
   Construction of the spinning plant is expected to begin within
three months, and production is to begin in mid-1991.

<HEAD>Court Won't Intervene in Las Vegas Dispute Over `Kismet' Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to alter the
fate of a 14-year-old copyright dispute over songs from the play
``Kismet.''
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that awarded
about $1.2 million to the writers and copyright holders of the play
from MGM Inc.
   MGM, under a license from the play's copyright owners, produced
a movie version in 1955.
   About six minutes of music from Kismet was included in a Las
Vegas show called ``Hallelujah Hollywood'' that ran at the MGM
Grand Hotel from 1974 to 1976.
   That use of the music sparked a copyright-infringement lawsuit
in 1976.
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher initially ordered MGM to
pay $22,000 for copyright infringement, but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that the award was ``grossly inadequate.''
   The judge subsequently awarded about $343,000, but the appeals
court upped it to about $1.2 million.
   MGM then sought Supreme Court review.
   The case is MGM vs. Frank Music Corp., 89-1269.

   Channel One, a news show with advertisements
aimed at teen-agers, made its national debut in an estimated 14,000
classrooms today with paid pitches for two kinds of snack foods and
a razor.
   The show was airing in about 400 schools across the country, the
producers said, even as critics continued to argue that its daily
regimen of commercials is out of place in the classroom.
   The advertisers on the first day of the program were M&amp;Ms candy
from M&amp;M Mars, Cheetos snacks from Frito-Lay Inc. and the Sensor
razor from Gillette Co.
   The program, which lasts 12 minutes with two minutes allocated
for advertising, also included an anti-drug public service
commercial.
   The show is the most ambitious and controversial project yet
from Whittle Communications, a Knoxville, Tenn.-based company
headed by Chairman Christopher Whittle that creates magazines and
other media used by advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences.
   A typical show begins with two young anchors giving the top
stories of the day, followed by a chapter in a five-part series
each week, a pop quiz and some interesting facts and a closing
story.
   The first week's featured series deals with the fall of the
Berlin Wall and how events in Eastern Europe have affected teens
there.
   Architects of the Channel One program say it should produce
handsome educational dividends for students and educators as well
as potentially lucrative financial rewards for the company
producing it.
   But critics say the commercials represent an unwarranted
intrusion on a captive audience of students who are required by law
to be in school.
   Officials in the states of New York and California have
prohibited public schools in those states from carrying the program
because of the commercials. A state board of education ban on
Channel One in North Carolina was overturned Friday by a state
court judge, freeing schools there to use the system.
   Several national education groups are opposing Channel One, and
are backing use of a daily commercial-free news show for teens that
the cable giant Turner Broadcasting System Inc. began running last
August on its Cable News Network.
   But Whittle said commercials are an essential element of the
Channel One system, because revenue from the $150,000 charge for
each 30-second ad pays for the $150 million in video equipment
loaned to schools that show the program and the $90 million in
operational expenses needed to produce it.
   Whittle said his surveys show few if any students are getting a
chance to watch the Turner ad-free news program in school because
there are few TV sets available in most schools.
   Ed Winter, the executive overseeing the Channel One project,
said more than 2,700 schools in 34 states have signed three-year
contracts to show the program to their students every school day.
He said six of every 10 schools approached have agreed to sign.
   Four hundred of these schools with 300,000 students have been
equipped with the dozens of TV sets, a satellite dish and video
recorders needed to record the show which is transmitted
automatically overnight by satellite.
   The company is signing schools to the system at the rate of more
than 100 a week, and hopes to have 1,000 participating by the end
of March and 7,000 to 8,000 schools with 6 million students by next
March.
   The Channel One program was tested last year for seven weeks in
six schools, and Whittle said it boosted student awareness of
current events and can be a powerful educational tool.

   Cogen Technologies Inc. said today it has secured
$870 million in financing to build a cogeneration power plant in
Linden, N.J., to provide power to Linden-area chemical and refining
companies and to Consolidated Edison Co. of New York.
   The financing, from General Electric Power Funding Corp., is one
of the largest packages ever for a cogeneration plant in the United
States, Robert C. McNair, president of Houston-based Cogen, said.
   Cogen and its affiliates will own and operate the plant, which
is designed to provide 614 megawatts of electric capacity and up to
1 million pounds per hour of steam. The company said the
electricity also could supply up to 860,000 homes.
   Construction is expected to begin in October with start-up in
mid 1992.
   The plant will be powered by natural gas provided by Public
Service and Gas Co. and Elizabethtown Gas, both of New Jersey.
   Cogen said the plant would be one of the cleanest facilities of
its size in the nation, with exhaust emissions levels only a
fraction of those produced by coal or oil-fired utility power
plants.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
dipped by three this week to 894, continuing a first-quarter trend,
Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The year-to-date count, however, remains well ahead of the 1989
tally, when 761 rigs were working.
   Traditionally, the rig count declines in the first quarter of
the year. Last week, the total fell by 21.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma showed a 10-rig loss
while Texas fell by eight. Kansas fell by four and Wyoming was down
by one.
   North Dakota posted a four-rig gain, while New Mexico and
Pennsylvania both were up two and Colorado, Louisiana and Michigan
were up one. California and Ohio were unchanged.

   It was hardly a typical deal for Frank Lorenzo,
head of an airline empire, takeover strategist and consummate
dealmaker.
   This time, the wily chairman of Texas Air Corp. got burned.
   His adversary wasn't the head of a rival airline, or one of his
Texas Air subordinates or even a union leader. It was David I.
Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for Eastern
Airlines, a Texas Air subsidiary.
   Lorenzo and his associates believed they had a deal with Shapiro
on Eastern and that the Washington attorney sandbagged them,
according to sources close to the negotiations, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The dispute wasn't over prices to be paid for assets, labor
concessions or airline routes. It was over words: powerful words in
a report by Shapiro that claimed Texas Air had short-changed
Eastern when it bought the airline and some of its assets.
   Shapiro had been directed to supervise an investigation of
Eastern and its dealings with Texas Air and sister carrier
Continental Airlines as part of Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceeding, which started last March after pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists struck the Miami-based airline.
   His report, filed last Thursday in federal bankruptcy court,
concluded that Texas Air purchased Eastern assets at unfairly low
prices and owed the carrier $285 million to $403 million.
   Texas Air and Eastern publicly called his report ``replete with
faulty analyses, hearsay evidence, statements taken out of context
and misstatements of fact.'' The companies threatened last Friday
to take ``serious and considered actions'' to clear their names.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent wouldn't say what form those
actions might take and declined further comment.
   Shapiro declined comment today when reached at his law firm in
Washington, D.C.
   ``There is sufficient evidence to warrant the bringing of
charges that (12) transactions provided Eastern with less than fair
consideration or reasonably equivalent value,'' the report said.
``...The court could therefore appropriately authorize litigation
of these 12 claims...''
   Charges. Litigation. Those were words Lorenzo and his team
weren't expecting to see in the report, according to the sources.
   Houston-based Texas Air had agreed earlier with Shapiro to pay
Eastern more than $280 million as a settlement on the condition,
sources said, that the report not assign any liability to Texas Air.
   Texas Air admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and said it
agreed to make the payment to Eastern only to bolster the airline.
   Although Shapiro's report said there were grounds for
litigation, he recommended court approval of the settlement as an
alternative. Nevertheless, his premise could tarnish Texas Air's
image because it implied wrongdoing on the company's part.
   Shapiro concluded a deal on the settlement with Texas Air
officials at around midnight last Wednesday. He was scheduled to
submit his report to the court and speak at a hearing on the
subject the next day.
   On Thursday morning, Texas Air officials received copies of the
report at the company's New York office in Rockefeller Center. It
wasn't what they were expecting.
   Some Texas Air officials initially believed Shapiro's associates
at his Washington office misunderstood his instructions to them
when he called around midnight Wednesday from New York after
striking the deal with Texas Air, sources said.
   The examiner apparently had two versions of his report prepared,
the sources said. After reaching agreement with the company, he is
believed to have told his colleagues to submit to the court the
version that excluded mention of possible litigation against the
company. Someone on Shapiro's team goofed, some insiders believed.
   Shapiro ``had two reports written from the get-go,'' said a
source close to the investigation, who described one version as
``heavy-handed'' and the other as ``wimpy''.
   Under a later theory, Shapiro's team failed in a frantic effort
starting late Wednesday to revise the report to reflect the
settlement in time for Thursday's hearing. According to that
scenario, Shapiro asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland for
more time but his request was refused.
   The hearing before Lifland was scheduled for 2 p.m. EST. Its
start was delayed, however, as Shapiro met in a stormy session in
Lifland's chambers with attorneys for Eastern and Texas Air,
Eastern's unions and its major creditors.
   ``They went ballistic,'' said one of those present, describing
the company lawyers' behavior. The company attorneys accused
Shapiro of breaching their agreement.
   After the hearing began and Shapiro addressed the court, he
departed from his prepared text at some points in an apparent
softening of the language _ saying charges ``could be brought''
against Texas Air, instead of ``can be brought,'' as the report
stated.
   The examiner also added several sentences indicating that the
purpose of his report was to determine if there is sufficient
evidence to establish claims, rather than to make ``a final finding
of fact''.
   He said measures to be taken to protect Eastern's interests
``could include'' _ instead of the original ``should include'' _
establishment of a monitoring body under the court's supervision.
That issue, opposed by Texas Air, had been one of the major
sticking points in reaching a settlement, sources said.
   In his report, Shapiro continued to reject the unions' request
that Eastern be run by an outside trustee.
   Texas Air officials said Lorenzo was unavailable to comment on
the settlement.
   A union attorney said the report vindicated the union's
longstanding claims that Texas Air had stripped assets from
Eastern. If Texas Air didn't agree with the report, it shouldn't
have signed the settlement, he said.
   ``We challenge Frank Lorenzo to withdraw from the settlement and
let the issues be tried in court,'' said Bruce Simon, an attorney
for the pilots union.

   Greyhound drivers walked picket lines today, some still wearing
black armbands in memory of a striker crushed by a bus driven by a
replacement. Fewer companies than expected applied to take over
Greyhound's routes.
   The union, meanwhile, said the company turned down a request to
resume talks, but America's only nationwide bus system said it
hasn't formally been asked.
   The union and Greyhound Lines Inc. also quibbled Sunday over how
many union drivers have crossed picket lines since the strike
affecting 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000 office and maintenance
workers began Friday.
   Greyhound has been operating with 700 replacement drivers plus,
it says, 350 union drivers who crossed picket lines. But the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions said only 95
union-represented drivers were behind the wheel.
   Some strikers who wouldn't cross the picket lines did stay off
them Sunday in memory of a co-worker crushed to death by a bus
while picketing in Redding, Calif.
   James La Sala, the union's international president, called today
for five minutes of silence by the pickets on Wednesday to coincide
with the beginning of a memorial service for the driver,
59-year-old Robert Waterhouse.
   Waterhouse was on vacation at the time of his death and had been
scheduled to retire in four months after 32 years on the job,
according to his widow, Dorie.
   ``It really wasn't even his strike,'' Mrs. Waterhouse said.
``But he was in there in support of his fellow drivers. He kept
saying, ``It's a matter of self pride.''
   Police did not charge the replacement driver and said the death
appeared to be accidental.
   Strikers in Jacksonville, Fla., Olympia, Wash., and Minneapolis
reported being struck by buses driven by replacement drivers over
the weekend, but there were no serious injuries.
   Shots were fired at a bus in Chicago on Friday; charter drivers
in Spokane, Wash., found bus electrical systems vandalized Sunday
morning, and a passenger in Philadelphia was charged Sunday with
spraying a striker with Mace.
   Also in Philadelphia, vice president of the Amalgamated Transit
Union local, John Bal, was arrested Saturday and charged with
criminal mischief for breaking a mirror off a Greyhound bus, police
said.
   Two Greyhound employees were arrested Saturday in Mount Laurel,
N.J., on charges of disabling a bus there, police said.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission said fewer small bus
companies than expected had applied to serve Greyhound routes
during the strike.
   An ICC board approved four temporary applications in the East,
but none of the companies serves points south of Virginia, said
Glenn Eady, ICC regional compliance officer in Philadelphia.
   ``The response is not what we expected,'' he said Sunday.
   The president of one small bus company that is owned by
Greyhound resigned during the weekend over what he termed ``basic
philosophical differences with my superiors.''
   John J. Dwyer, 52, who headed Vermont Transit Co. in Burlington,
Vt., said he quit Saturday after firing four employees who refused
to drive routes normally handled by the striking Greyhound drivers.
He declined to say whether he had quit because of the firings.
   One of the of the fired drivers, Andrew Bahr, said he guessed
that Dwyer resigned because he didn't want to fire anyone else.
   ``I knew he never wanted to do it,'' Bahr said. ``Basically he
was a very fair man. Everything you dealt with him on was very
fair. He fired us graciously.''
   The dispute over whether the union has sought to resume talks
centers on a meeting Friday night in Scottsdale, Ariz., between
union president Edward M. Strait and P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound
executive vice president and chief negotiator.
   Chairman Fred G. Currey said Saturday the company had received
no formal request to resume negotiations.
   But union spokesman Nick Nichols said, ``I don't know what he
defines as formal. What do they need, an engraved invitation?''
Another spokesman, Jeffrey Nelson, reiterated on Sunday the union's
belief that it had sought new talks.
   The two sides were reported to be divided over wages and job
security.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and corn futures were moderately lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
dimming hopes for new Soviet trade and forecasts for beneficial
moisture in most crop-growing areas.
   Soybean futures were mixed in early trading.
   Precipitation was forecast for this week in virtually all U.S.
and South American agricultural areas.
   Further selling in the wheat and corn markets stemmed from
reports that the Soviet Union had deferred some imports of European
grain, possibly due to transportation or credit problems.
   Whatever the reason, ``if they defer from them, they probably
won't buy from us either,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in
Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Buying in the soybean market appeared to reflect a spillover of
bullish sentiment in the adjacent soybean meal and oil pits.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1} cents to 5\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.83{ a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.45 a bushel;
oat futures were \ cent to } cent higher with March at $1.45 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to \ cent higher with March at
$5.69 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .02 cent to .37 cent higher with April
at 76.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .48 cent
higher with March at 80.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
lower to .55 cent higher with April at 50.55 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .05 cent higher with March at

   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

<HEAD>Doskocil Cos. And Subsidiaries Plan Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUTCHINSON, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doskocil Cos. said today it and its
subsidiaries plan to file for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   The Hutchinson, Kan.-based company and its largest subsidiary,
Wilson Foods Corp. of Oklahoma City, announced last week they were
having financial problems and had defaulted on two large loans.
   On Friday, the company said about 50 employees agreed to a
voluntary layoff to help during the cash flow crunch.
   In a news release early today, Larry Doskocil, company founder
and board chairman, said agreement had been reached with Chemical
Bank of New York and other senior lenders to provide $65 million in
secured interim financing, subject to bankruptcy court approval.
   The loans, which replace a $50 million revolving credit
agreement, are intended to allow Doskocil and Wilson Foods to
continue operating without interruption while finishing the details
of a reorganization plan.
   ``We are not going out of business,'' Doskocil said. ``We do not
anticipate closing any plants, although initially there may be some
temporary disruptions.''
   The Chapter 11 filing will relieve the company of some of the
current payments due on its debts and allow more time for the sale
of some assets, including the Wilson Brands division of Wilson
Foods.
   That division's sale is taking longer than anticipated, meaning
the proceeds from it haven't been available to help pay off the
debt taken on from the 1988 acquisition of Wilson, a much-larger
competitor.
   In addition to the Wilson Brands sale delay, Doskocil also
attributed the filing to lower operating profits during recent
quarters than it had anticipated.
   Last week Doskocil announced it was in default on a $133 million
loan and had been unable to make some other payments to other
creditors.
   Doskocil and its subsidiaries formulate, process and market
specialty precooked meat, meat toppings, pepperoni, and other
speciality meats.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Banking Dispute Now Irrelevant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled that a dispute
between Florida and an Illinois-based bank holding company blocked
by Florida from setting up an industrial savings bank has become
legally irrelevant.
   The court unanimously ruled that a 1987 federal law giving
states specific authority to block such moves by out-of-state bank
holding companies has rendered the dispute moot.
   The decision is a victory for Florida, but a setback for
Continental Bank Corp.
   The court last June agreed to review the case even though Bush
administration lawyers told the justices the 1987 change in federal
banking law had made the case moot.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Antonin Scalia never
acknowledged the Bush administration advice that initially went
unheeded.
   Continental Bank in 1981 filed an application with the Florida
Department of Banking and Finance to establish and run an
industrial savings bank in Mami.
   The proposed bank would not accept demand deposits or make
commercial loans _ making it a so-called ``non-bank bank'' that
fell outside the federal law's definition of banks.
   The application was denied, and Continental Bank subsequently
sued in federal court. The suit alleged that Florida's action was
unconstitutional.
   Scalia said 1987 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956 bars bank holding companies from establishing or acquiring a
bank in another state ``unless the latter state's statutes
specifically authorize it to do so.''
   The law ``thus effectively permits states to prevent
out-of-state holding companies from owning in-state banks,'' Scalia
said.
   The case is Lewis vs. Continental Bank, 87-1956.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors at state hospitals nationwide went
on strike Monday for higher wages, a union spokesman said.
   The strike came amid continuing labor unrest, including walkouts
by 12,000 tax officials protesting alleged loopholes in proposed
tax legislation and employees in some departments of the central
bank and National Bank of Greece over wages.
   Doctors in provincial state hospitals started a 48-hour strike
Monday. About 70 percent of the doctors in the Athens area staged a
four-hour stoppage in sympathy and will repeat it on Tuesday, said
Georgios Sepirgiotis, vice president of the Hospital Doctors Union
for Athens and Piraeus.
   The doctors are objecting to a cost-cutting recommendation by
the State Audit Council that a ceiling should be set on the number
of overtime shifts doctors may work, to be calculated in line with
basic pay levels.
   Sepirgiotis also said hospital doctors had not received a raise
since 1983.
   An intern receives $212 per month, almost half the wage of a
17-year-old factory worker, Sepirgiotis said.
   There are nearly 9,000 doctors registered in state hospitals,
with 4,000 in the Athens area alone.

   In the downtown offices of a powerful
insurance company, the walls in a second-floor suite are decorated
with buckets and iron bed keys.
   They share a place of honor with antique firefighter helmets and
with steam-powered fire engines and hose reels in the lobby of
Cigna Corp.'s headquarters. The result is a prestigious corporate
museum.
   These samples of the technology that has kept the company in
business celebrate the long, colorful history of firefighting in
Philadelphia, where Cigna got its start nearly 200 years ago
insuring against fire and shipping losses.
   Cigna's business traditions are reflected in the museum
collection, devoted to the otherwise unrelated histories of
maritime shipping and firefighting. Models and paintings of sailing
ships the company once insured are displayed around the corner from
firemen's tools and ceremonial clothing.
   Over the years, as more sophisticated equipment gave
firefighters better odds against the flames, insurance companies
benefited. Now it is Cigna's turn to do the salvaging and preserve
firefighting relics.
   The museum collection contains 9,000 pieces, says curator
Melissa Hough. Many of the best items are exhibited in the downtown
Philadelphia museum, but as much as 85 percent of the collection is
either on loan to museums around the country or spread around
Cigna's 60 corporate offices here and abroad, Ms. Hough said.
   Firefighting traditions in Philadelphia go back to the bucket
brigades of the early Colonial times. The nation's first volunteer
fire company was founded here in 1736 and the first fire insurance
company, Ben Franklin's Contributionship, started 16 years later.
   In the 19th century, the firehouse was a center of male
camaraderie and competition, with rivalries played out fighting
fires.
   One museum painting shows a race between horse-drawn fire
engines of rival companies, each trying to be the first to a fire.
Another shows several fire companies at an 1850 contest to see
whose hoses could squirt water the highest.
   The competition between volunteer fire companies, Ms. Hough
said, eventually became a problem as firemen became ``just plain
rowdy.'' They called false alarms to sabotage other companies and
cut their rivals' hoses. Ms. Hough said the problem peaked right
after the Civil War, and in 1871 the city stepped in and
established a professional fire department.
   Many firefighting buffs visit Cigna's museum. In many
Pennsylvania communities, volunteer fire companies remain part of
the social fabric as they once were in Philadelphia.
   Hough said school children come on class trips, and one of their
favorite games is to guess the use of some of the odd-looking tools
displayed in the museum.
   They play with wooden rattles, once used by watchmen to rouse
neighbors in the event of a fire, and learn that a strange-looking
piece of iron is a bed key, actually a critical firefighting tool.
   Firemen carried bed keys so they could quickly disassemble beds
and carry them out of burning homes. Beds were among the most
expensive pieces of furniture, and salvaging them was important to
homeowners, as well as to their insurance companies.
   In 1794, the Insurance Company of North America, a predecessor
of Cigna, was the first to offer fire insurance on the contents of
a building.
   Cigna, the eighth-largest insurance company in the world, had
revenue of $17 billion in 1988, the last year for which complete
figures are available.
   The portion of company business now devoted to fire insurance is
difficult to calculate, said Cigna spokesman James Ely, because
fire insurance is typically part of a package including theft and
liability insurance. About 20 percent of Cigna's revenues are from
such commercial packages, he said.

<HEAD>Florida Hurt, Helped by Brazil Orange Juice Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every time Florida shivers, Brazil tightens
its grip on the U.S. orange juice market.
   The South American giant again is shipping millions of gallons
of juice to the United States at premium prices in the wake of the
third major freeze in Florida's citrus groves in six years.
   The flood from a competitor is a mixed blessing: Florida
processors may take most of the imported juice supply to blend with
their limited local supply in making frozen concentrated orange
juice.
   ``We will be importing more than 50 percent of our product to
meet market demand,'' says Executive Director Dan Gunter of the
Florida Department of Citrus. ``Imports will probably exceed the
level of 1985,'' which when processors needed supply help due to
crop-killing frosts in December 1983 and January 1985.
   Production in Florida, which until 1982 was the world leader in
citrus, is expected to fall sharply due to damage from the
Christmastime freeze. The state's share of expected U.S. production
of ``single-strength equivalent'' (SSE) juice _ which includes
concentrate, chilled and canned juice _ is seen as falling to about
45 percent from 70.6 percent last year.
   Brazil, meanwhile, is expected to have a record crop this year
and export a record 319 million gallons of concentrated juice.
   Orange processors in California, Texas and Arizona may account
for only 6 percent of the total U.S. juice supply this year. As a
result, domestic orange-juice imports _ principally from Brazil _
will total about 625 million SSE gallons, according to industry
economists, up 72 percent from the 1988-89 import level.
   At the same time, juice prices have risen sharply.
   Within the past year, the wholesale price for Brazilian juice
has risen from $1.50 a pound to $2.12 a pound this year. And
because Brazil is the world's largest producer-exporter, it sets
the price _ so consumers will be paying more, no matter where their
juice comes from.
   American grocery store prices are expected to average $4.17 a
gallon during the current processing season, an increase of 12.4
percent over the previous year.
   Particularly ironic to Florida industry leaders is that
processors in this state may take 60 percent of all imported juice
to blend with the limited local supply in making Florida frozen
concentrated orange juice.
   The state expects to pack about 93 million gallons of frozen
concentrate this year and will import about 93 million gallons,
compared with packing of 175 million gallons and imports of 52
million gallons in 1989.
   The state's citrus industry views the imported juice situation
in a bittersweet vein: In good times, many bitterly criticize
Brazilian imports, although some state processors traditionally buy
Brazilian product to blend with what is considered higher-quality
Florida orange juice.
   In bad times, particularly after frigid weather ices the fruit
or destroys trees, Florida depends on Brazil to make up the supply
difference and maintain a steady market and a good price.
   ``Florida's problems serve as an impetus for Brazil to plant
more trees and produce a bigger crop,'' says Bobby McKown,
executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's
largest grower trade association with 12,000 members.
   ``This can lead to excess supplies in the future and prices will
drop and we'll need to increase demand,'' McKown says. Brazilian
imports may help in the short-term, he says, ``But we need to work
on a long-term basis. I don't think Brazil is doing enough to
expand the markets. We do most of that. After a freeze, they just
clear their inventory.''
   But Gunter said that because of Brazil's bumper crop and
Florida's shortfall, the total amount of orange juice available
actually may be about the same as last year.
   Brazil's record-high price ``is probably based on an expected
lower volume for next year,'' Gunter said recently. ``Brazil
evidently wants to hold down sales to maintain volume because their
crop is expected to be smaller next year.''

<TEXT>
   NEC Corp., Japan's leading computer maker, said
Monday it will spend about $40 million to increase the use of
foreign-made semiconductors by July 1991 when a U.S.-Japan
semiconductor agreement expires.
   NEC officials said the company decided to raise its share of
foreign-made chips to about 24 percent of the total at the request
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Currently,
about 20 percent of the chips it uses are imported.
   The agency was reported to have made the request out of concern
that the United States might take retaliatory trade action unless
U.S.-made semiconductors account for 20 percent of the Japanese
market by the time the bilateral accord expires.
   NEC is reported to have been buying semiconductors worth about
$1.3 billion a year from outside the company, with foreign-made
chips accounting for about $267 million of that total.
   According to industry statistics, foreign-made chips accounted
for 12 percent of the Japanese market in the third quarter of last
year, far short of the 20 percent share the United States has been
seeking.

<HEAD>Volvo: Alliance With Renault Could Take Until Mid-1990's To
Influence Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Swedish automaker AB Volvo said
Monday that it could take until the mid-1990's for the fruits of
its alliance with France's state-owned Renault to show up in the
form of higher profits.
   Pehr G. Gyllenhammar told a reporter that while cost-cutting
measures could be implemented almost immediately, significant
payoffs from the alliance will take much longer.
   ``The big money will take four to five years, I think, because
it has to do with the components and products that we can develop
jointly,'' Gyllenhammar said. ``We will find cost-cutting earlier,
but not of any dramatic nature.''
   The two automakers announced Feb. 23 an agreement in which they
will take stakes in each other and work jointly in the future in
such areas as research, product development and purchasing.
   The accord aims to achieve economies of scale and to extend the
reach of both companies, although each will remain legally
independent. Executives at both companies say the Volvo and Renault
brand names will remain distinct.
   Renault President Raymond H. Levy accompanying Gyllenhammer at a
news conference declined to say when he thought profits would
improve as a result of the alliance.
   Gyllenhammar reiterated that the decision to forge the agreement
with Renault didn't represent an effort by either of the partners
eventually to take over the other.
   Asked about rumors that Volvo was in talks with Mitsubishi
Motors of Japan and Chrysler Corp. of the U.S. on possible
cooperation agreements or joint ventures, Gyllenhammar said:
``There's an ongoing dialogue in our business.''
   Under terms of the accord with Renault, each partner can enter
joint ventures and partnerships with other companies, provided that
the other partner approves, he said.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Tumble On Wet Weather Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed moderately lower
Monday as wet weather in the Great Plains prompted steady selling
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn and soybean futures were mixed.
   Rain was expected throughout the U.S. wheat region this week.
Winter wheat areas in particular have been receiving ample moisture
recently after pronounced dryness in the fall and early winter.
   Wheat futures also were pressured by technical factors and
unconfirmed rumors that the Soviet Union has been seeking to delay
some imports of European grain due to transportation or credit
problems.
   Strength in the soybean and corn markets reflected perceptions
that farmers must plant more of those commodities than early
indications suggest to meet the anticipated demand, said William
Biedermann, director of research with Allendale Inc., a commodities
brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Biedermann dismissed talk of quality problems with the South
American soybean crop, which is nearing maturity.
   ``We checked with some commercials on this and they do not think
it's anything substantial,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.85 a bushel; corn futures
were 1 cent lower to } cent higher with March at $2.44} a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 1\ cents higher with March at $1.45{ a

   Mechanics at Trump Shuttle, the northeast
airline service named after the real estate tycoon who bought it
last spring, will vote soon on which union should represent them,
the airline announced Monday.
   The 90 mechanics at Trump Shuttle, along with 125 ground service
workers, currently are represented by the International Association
of Machinists. The company said the National Mediation Board
decided last Friday to grant the request of a rival group, the
Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, for an election for the
mechanics to decide their union representation.
   ``We're entirely neutral; it's up to the employees,'' Trump
Shuttle spokeswoman Joan Fudala said.
   The Machinists union had filed a petition with the mediation
board objecting to AMFA's request. Machinists spokesman Jim Conley
in Washington said Monday the union was considering contesting the
board's decision in federal court, but probably would let it stand.
   ``We're probably going to go ahead and have the election,'' he
said.
   A recorded phone message at AMFA's office said officials of the
group were unavailable.
   Nearly all the Machinists at Trump Shuttle, which links New York
with Boston and Washington, formerly worked for Eastern Airlines.
Billionaire developer Donald Trump bought the shuttle service from
Miami-based Eastern for $365 million.
   The AMFA challenge had delayed contract negotiations between
Trump Shuttle management and the Machinists union.
   Late last month, the Trump Shuttle pilots approved a new
four-year contract that provides for wage increases averaging 10
percent this year and a total 15 percent over the next three years.
   The pilots' contract also makes changes in work rules to allow
greater scheduling flexibility and calls for the pilots to begin
sharing increased costs of medical benefits in 1991. The agreement
is scheduled to be signed Thursday in Washington.
   Contract talks covering the 280 flight attendants at Trump
Shuttle are due to start around April 1, according to Ms. Fudala.

<HEAD>Plans to Sell Datastream International, Interactive Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., a leading marketer of
business information and services, said Monday it plans to sell two
subsidiaries that provide historical investment information and
related services.
   The company said it planned to sell Datastream International, a
London-based provider of investment information, research and
portfolio accounting services throughout Europe and the Far East on
international securities.
   Also put up for sale was Interactive Data, based in Lexington,
Mass., a provider of securities-related information, software and
systems to the U.S. investment community.
   ``While these are fine businesses, we believe that it is in the
best interest of D&amp;B's shareowners to focus our investments and
resources on those key markets in which D&amp;B's participation and
leadership positions are strongest,'' said Charles W. Moritz,
chairman and chief executive.
   He identified some of the largest of those markets as those for
risk-management information services, marketing information
services, directory information services and business-applications
software.
   Datastream and Interactive Data had combined revenue of $155
million in 1989. Datastream was acquired in June 1984 for $102
million; Interactive Data was acquired in March 1988 for $140
million.
   Moritz said the company expects the investment and redeployment
of the proceeds from the sales to offset lost operating income from
the two units.
   ``Actions such as restructuring certain D&amp;B businesses and share
repurchase will be considered,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the company continues to expect that 1990 earnings
per share will be in the range of $2.80, Moritz said. The company
earned $3.14 a share in 1989 and $2.67 a share in 1988.
   The company previously has blamed the impact of lower sales at
its U.S. credit services business and the costs of ``repositioning
actions'' in that area for the anticipated decline in earnings.
   The U.S. credit services division was stung by complaints from
some customers last year that they had been overcharged. The
company said it has taken corrective steps in recent months.
   Moritz said the divestitures will ``simplify D&amp;B's business
mix'' and will not affect its plans for Moody's Investors Service,
which provides corporate and public finance debt ratings. The
company plans to maintain and strengthen Moody's postition and to
invest in its international expansion.

<HEAD>Two Campeau Lenders Agree to Defer Interest Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., the Canadian parent of U.S.
retailers trying to reorganize under bankruptcy court protection,
said Monday two of its major lenders have agreed to help the
company by deferring $5.2 million in loan interest payments.
   The property and retail company also said it will work with
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. and The Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
during the deferral period on a plan to determine Campeau's fate.
   Interest due Olympia &amp; York on Feb. 28 under two loans, of $75
million and $150 million, will be deferred until March 7. Campeau
said in an announcement released from its Toronto headquarters that
it won't be considered in default for failing to pay the interest
until March 7.
   The monthly payments due on the two Olympia &amp; York loans total
$1.7 million.
   A similar agreement was signed with DeBartolo under which
DeBartolo agreed to a deferral on interest payments on a $480
million loan until March 7. The payments, which were due March 1,
are owed by Federated Stores Inc., the Cincinnati-based holding
company of Campeau's U.S. retailing operations, and guaranteed by
Campeau.
   Federated, which operates Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp., owes monthly interest on the DeBartolo loan of
$3.5 million.
   Allied and Federated filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act on Jan. 15 in the biggest
retail bankruptcy filing ever. They listed total debt of $7.7
billion, amassed when they were taken over in 1986 and 1988 by
Campeau.
   Their department stores are: Abraham &amp; Straus, Bloomingdale's,
Bon Marche, Burdines, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Maas Brothers,
Rich's-Goldsmith's and Stern's.
   Campeau spokesman Richard W. Wertheim said the company has the
money available to cover the debt payments. But Olympia &amp; York and
DeBartolo agreed it was appropriate to defer the payments while
Campeau works on a plan on how its business will be run in the
future.
   He said Campeau hopes to announce a longer term deferral soon.
   ``We're not going to have a business plan by Wednesday,'' he
said.
   Wertheim would not comment on what a business plan might
involve, such as asset sales or debt restructuring. The plan
concerns Campeau's Canadian operations only, which mainly are real
estate development.

<HEAD>January Construction Contracts Off 3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts for new construction nationwide slid 3
percent in January, extending a slump that is mostly confined to
the Northeast and South Atlantic regions, the F.W. Dodge division
of McGraw-Hill Inc. reported Monday.
   The Dodge Index, which uses 1982 as its 100 base, fell to 155 in
January from 160 in December and was well off its most recent peak
of 181 reached last September.
   The yearly pace of total contracting was $244.30 billion in
January, down from $251.44 billion in December.
   In January, contracts for non-residential buildings declined 4
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $83.75 billion from
$87.16 billion in December.
   The value of residential work edged 1 percent lower to $115.97
billion from $117.07 billion.
   Non-building construction contracts, such as for public works
and utility projects, dropped 6 percent to $44.58 billion from
$47.21 billion.
   ``The weakening of construction activity that has set in over
the past six months has a decidedly regional tilt to it,'' said
George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist of F.W.
Dodge.
   He said virtually all of the decline has been concentrated in
two regions: the Northeast and South Atlantic.
   States included in the Northeast region are the New England
states plus, New Jersey, New York and, Pennsylvania. The South
Alantic region is made up of Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
North and South Carolina, Virgina, Washington and West Virginia.
   ``By contrast, the central and western parts of the country are
continuing to build at close to last year's rate,'' Christie said.

<HEAD>American Manufacturers Increasing Foreign Investment, Mainly In
Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American manufacturers increased foreign
investment activity last year mainly in Europe, lured by potential
commercial and financial opportunities in Eastern Europe, the
Conference Board reported Monday.
   U.S. manufacturers started 217 new foreign projects in 1989, a
20 percent jump over 1988, and are continuing to invest overseas at
a similar rate in the first few weeks of 1990, the business and
finance research organization said.
   Of the new investments last year, the majority _ 53 percent _
were in Western Europe.
   ``With events in Eastern Europe now suggesting a dramatic
expansion in the European market, many American firms are
strengthening their presence in Europe to take advantage of future
growth opportunities,'' said James Greene, the Conference Board's
international investment specialist.
   The European investments included 72 acquisitions, 24 joint
ventures, 14 new plants and six expansions of existing facilities.
   The United Kingdom attracted 38 American projects, followed by
West Germany with 17, Italy with 15, France 14 and the Netherlands
13. Eastern Europe attracted nine investors, the Soviet Union six,
Hungary two and Yugoslavia one.
   But Canada also emerged as a new target for U.S. investors,
netting 35 new projects, the board said.
   ``The Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement may well have ended
Canada's status as a satellite market and assured it of a much
wider global role,'' Greene said.
   Twelve investment projects were started in Japan last year,
including 10 joint ventures, and three were in China.
   Manufacturing businesses that went abroad were mainly in
chemicals, electronics, food and transportation.

<HEAD>Shearson Closing Up to 50 Brokerage Offices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is closing up to 50
retail brokerage offices nationwide as part of across-the-board
cutbacks under parent American Express Co., the investment firm
said Monday.
   Shearson also was said to be trying to sell its troubled Balcor
real estate management subsidiary, which has more than $1 billion
in real estate loans and direct investments outstanding in a shaky
market.
   The reductions are part of an overhaul being engineered by
American Express, which over the last two months gradually has
moved to take full control of Shearson, its Wall Street investment
subsidiary.
   American Express announced Sunday that it was buying the
remaining publicly held shares of Shearson, reversing its earlier
stated intention of reducing its ownership stake to less than 50
percent.
   Most of the Shearson brokers were informed of the office
closings, some of which are to take effect immediately, on Monday
and last Friday. The firm would not disclose specific offices to be
closed.
   Shearson, the nation's second largest retail brokerage, has
about 10,000 brokers at 600 branches nationwide.
   Shearson spokeswoman Suzanne Quigley said 45 to 50 offices would
be closed or consolidated with other offices by April 1. Layoffs
would occur, but Quigley declined to specify an amount. She said
there would be no disruption to client accounts at the closed
offices.
   As part of the reduction, sources at the firm said, Shearson
would consolidate management of investment products in the hands of
fewer executives per region.
   Shearson last week announced it would lay off 2,000 off its
35,500 employees by the end of the month. Employees said layoffs
were occurring daily in a variety of departments.
   Like other Wall Street firms, Shearson's retail brokerage
division has been hit by a downturn in the securities industry
since the 1987 stock market crash. Shearson had expanded
drastically in the field, including the acquisition of E.F. Hutton
&amp; Co. in January 1988 that more than doubled its retail force.
   Analysts said the retail closings would trim some unneeded
personnel and reduce overhead.
   The sources at Shearson said the firm was cutting back much of
its real estate activities, leading with the planned elimination of
one department this week and the expected sale of Balcor, which had
145 loans worth about $1.1 billion last Nov. 30.
   According to federal filings, Balcor had nonperforming assets of
$114 million, including nonperforming loans and about $22 million
in owned real estate. The subsidiary has just $10 million in
reserves to cover its portfolio of loans to real-estate
partnerships and client companies.
   The high level of nonperforming assets and low level of reserves
have raised concern because a downturn in the nation's commercial
property industry has raised the chances that more loans could be
vulnerable. The sources did not identify a potential buyer for
Balcor.
   ``Balcor isn't that important to the revenue or profits of
Shearson overall,'' said Perrin Long, who follows the securities
industry for Lipper Analytical Services. ``However, it could be a
major negative to profits if they have to take reserves against bad
loans.''
   A Shearson spokesman, Steven Faigen, declined to comment on
whether Shearson was seeking a buyer for Balcor. ``There's a
strategic review ongoing and its results are still being
fashioned,'' he said.
   More job cuts and large charges against earnings are expected as
part of the review.
   American Express' decision to buy back Shearson shares it does
not own was viewed as a another show of support for by the credit
card and financial services giant for its subsidiary. Prior to
Sunday's announcement American Express already had agreed to pump
more than $1 billion into Shearson.
   But analysts also said the move, which involves exchanging $350
million worth of American Express shares for the 28 million
publicly held Shearson shares, did not eliminate the possibility of
selling all or part of Shearson.
   Taking Shearson out of public hands will give American Express
more flexibility in tackling the restructuring at the firm,
analysts said, because it will occur out of the public eye.
   The buyback also ended for now talks on merging Shearson with
Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. unit.

   Energy futures rallied Monday with prices of
wholesale gasoline and home heating oil posting sharp gains.
   Traders scrambled to buy contracts for petroleum products on the
New York Mercantile Exchange on the assumption that Exxon Corp.'s
suspension in operations at a New Jersey refinery could cause
temporary tightness in regional supplies.
   The contract for April delivery of unleaded regular gasoline
surged 2.83 cents to 59.30 cents a gallon, expanding on Friday
increase of 0.66 cent. Contracts for delivery further in the future
also advanced, but more moderately.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc, home
heating oil for April delivery soared 2.12 cents to 57.99 cents a
gallon after a jump of 1.24 cents on Friday. Later contracts were
up by slightly smaller amounts.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of
U.S. crude oil, rose 23 cents to close at $21.58 per 42-gallon
barrel following Friday's rise of 18 cents. Later contracts posted
slightly larger gains.
   Andrew Lebow, a broker at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said strength in products led the energy markets higher.
   He said Exxon's decision to suspend tanker and barge operations
at its Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., will idle the refinery,
reducing daily refining capacity in the New York harbor area by
130,000 barrels. Total capacity in the area has been estimated at
465,000 barrels a day, he said.
   Exxon indefinitely suspended the operations in the wake of two
oil spills in waterways surrounding the refinery this year.

   The stock market drifted lower in a quiet
session Monday, failing to extend last week's run of five
consecutive gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 96.17 points last
week, dropped 10.81 to 2,649.55.
   Big Board volume totaled 140.11 million shares, against 164.33
million in the previous session.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
684 up, 830 down and 466 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.11 million
shares, down from 164.33 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 168.64 million shares.
   Analysts said recent hopes persisted that the economy might
avert a recession and start growing at a revived rate as the year
passed.
   But traders also appeared edgy over the interest-rate outlook,
especially if business activity should pick up.
   Rates rose in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government
bonds fell about $10 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their
yields in the 8.64 percent-8.70 percent range.
   In addition, brokers said, buying interest quickly died down
when it became evident that last week's advance in stock prices
wasn't carrying over into Monday's session.
   On the agenda for the markets Tuesday is a government report on
factory orders for January, which are expected to show a big
decline.
   American Express ranked among the volume leaders, down 1~ at
27{, and Shearson Lehman Hutton fell | to 11~. Over the weekend
American Express announced plans to reacquire the publicly held
shares of Shearson through an exchange of stock.
   Besides American Express, losers among the blue chips included
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down { at 39~; General Motors, down
\ at 45}; General Electric, down | at 61}, and Exxon, down { at 46\.
   On the plus side, International Business Machines rose &lsqb; to 105
and Philip Morris was up { at 37&rsqb;.
   Mylan Laboratories dropped 1&lsqb; to 20~ following a downbeat
appraisal of the stock in Barron's magazine.
   Dataproducts Corp., traded on the American Stock Exchange, fell
1 to 4~. The company said it had received tenders for some 17.76
million shares on its offer to buy back 4 million shares for $10
apiece.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $12.49 billion, or 0.39
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .82 to 184.15.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.76 to 384.49, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.80 at 333.74.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .87 to 430.15. At the Amex, the market value index closed
at 356.64, up .52.

   Sales of cars and light trucks made in North
America slumped 7.9 percent in late February compared with last
year when consumers rushed to showrooms to snatch up expiring
incentives, automakers said Monday.
   For the entire month, sales of domestic and imported automobiles
and light trucks were down 4.7 percent, reflecting sagging interest
in cash rebates and low interest financing that were the rage in
January and February 1989.
   The incentives in early 1989 turned many spring car buyers into
late winter purchasers.
   ``It's not going too bad,'' said sales Manager Fred Voelkel of
Brown and Brown Chevrolet-Geo in Mesa, Ariz. ``We're down a little
from last year.''
   The nine major automakers making vehicles in North America said
they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 42,688 during
the Feb. 21-28 period this year, compared with a rate of 46,336
during the same time last year.
   Sales of new cars fell 6.7 percent and truck sales were down 10
percent.
   For the first two months of this year, domestic and overseas
automakers reported vehicle sales were off 0.8 percent, indicating
a strong January sales rate was being watered down by a weaker
February rate.
   Automakers are keeping a careful eye on their new-vehicle
inventories in anticipation of what they hope will be a return to a
tradition of a spring buying spree in March and April.
   At the beginning of last year, automakers advertised the
incentive programs that expired, for the most part, at the end of
February. The specter of those programs ending turned likely spring
buyers into late-winter purchasers grabbing a good deal.
   That disrupted the tradition of a sales bulge in March and
April. This year, incentives in effect in January and February
didn't generate the same buying excitement, with the notable
exception of Chrysler's incentives on minivans in January, which
boosted year-to-date sales figures for 1990.
   ``We are in shape for a good spring,'' said Voelkel. ``That's
when we build up our inventories and build up our advertising a
little bit.''
   He said he expects his current 75-day supply of cars to swell to
around 90 days by spring.
   GM's car and truck sales for late February ran 2.4 percent
behind last year's pace, with car sales off 3.8 percent and truck
sales up 0.9 percent. For the entire year, GM vehicles sold at a
pace 0.2 percent ahead of last year.
   Ford's car and truck sales fell 19.1 percent in late February,
partly because of strong fleet sales a year ago, said Robert Rewey,
the company's vice president for North American sales.
   Car sales by the nation's No. 2 automaker fell 24.5 percent
during the period and truck sales were off 10.8 percent.
   For the first two months of the year, Ford's cars and trucks
were selling at a pace 6.6 percent behind last year's rate, with
car sales down 8.7 percent and truck sales falling by 3.6 percent.
   Chrysler said its late-February car sales fell 11.6 percent and
truck sales were off 21.3 percent compared with a year ago,
combining for a 16 percent decline in vehicle sales. For the year,
Chrysler's car and truck sales, which got a big boost from the
minivan incentives in January, were up 2 percent.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Soar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices soared above $1 a pound Monday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid rising concern about
tight availability of high-quality coffee.
   On other futures markets, copper futures surged; cotton futures
were up sharply; energy futures were higher; precious metals were
mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock andmeat
futures were mixed.
   Coffee futures settled 4.64 cents to 5.5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $1.045 a pound, its highest
settlement since June 30.
   Analysts said the rally, which marked the market's fourth
consecutive day of unusual strength, was not related to any change
in the supply-demand picture but to the same factors that have
recently supported the market.
   Those factors include civil strife in the Ivory Coast, a coffee
supply shortfall in Mexico, a lack of availability from Ecuador and
poor growing conditions for coffee in Colombia.
   ``All the reports today were basically news we already had,''
said Celeste Georkakis, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services
Inc. in New York.
   The rally was considered especially significant, though, because
coffee futures surpassed $1 a pound, a price at which coffee had
not traded since early July, when the International Coffee
Organization lifted export quotas and exposed prices to the free
market.
   Coffee futures plunged below 70 cents a pound last year as
producers sold out their warehoused stocks but the recent rise
indicates the market is moving toward a more balanced
supply-and-demand situation.
   With prices now above $1, chances for a return to export quotas
look slim, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., who said that at these prices, producers are likely to become
more willing sellers.
   ``The concern about nearby availability is likely to moderate up
here at higher price levels, which should allow sales to pick up,''
she said.
   Copper futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange on
supply worries exacerbated by the Comex's report that its warehouse
stocks of copper fell 175 short tons Friday and by the London Metal
Exchange's report of a 4,475 metric ton decline last week in its
stocks.
   Copper futures settled 2.3 cents to 3.6 cents higher with March
at $1.23 a pound.
   Also on the Comex, gold futures settled $1 to $1.20 higher with
April at $406.60 a troy ounce; silver futures were 1 cent lower
across the board with March at $5.116 a troy ounce.
   Some cotton futures soared the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange on strong technical signals.
   Cotton finished .85 cent to 2.07 cents higher with March, on
which the limit has been removed pending the contract's expiration,
at 70.15 cents a pound.
   Heating oil and gasoline futures climbed sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid supply worries linked to the shutdown of
Exxon's Bayway, N.J., refinery pending an investigation into last
week's spill of oil in the adjacent waterway.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 37 cents
higher with April at $21.58 a barrel; heating oil was .91 cent to
2.12 cents higher with April at 57.99 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent to 2.83 cents higher with April at 59.30
cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures prices closed moderately lower Monday as wet
weather in the Great Plains prompted steady selling on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Corn and soybean futures were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower with March at
$3.85 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to { cent higher with March
at $2.44} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents higher with March
at $1.46 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3} cents higher
with March at $5.70} a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.05 cent to .25 cent higher with April at 76.50 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .23 cent to .45 cent higher with March at 80.82
cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent lower to .08 cent higher
with April at 49.72 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20
cent to 1.32 cents lower with March at 48.02 cents a pound.

   Four large fast-food chains are breaking an
agreement to offer on-the-spot nutritional information about their
menus and to make sure customers know the brochures are available,
a consumer group said Monday.
   ``We are sorry to report ... that, after initial compliance, the
voluntary program has broken down,'' the Center for Science in the
Public Interest said in letters to the attorneys general of Texas,
California and New York.
   The three state officials won agreement from five chains in July
1986 to provide ingredient and nutrition information at all
outlets. The consumer group said that the companies were supposed
to post signs alerting diners to the availability of a brochure and
that the policies were supposed to apply nationwide.
   The Washington-based center, a non-profit health advocacy
organization with 200,000 members, said only the Jack in the Box
chain remains in substantial compliance with the agreement. Based
on a survey of outlets in eight states and the District of
Columbia, the consumer group said, Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's
and Kentucky Fried Chicken have slipped.
   Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director, said in a
statement that his organization had ``urged the attorneys general
to consider prosecuting the companies unless they resume full
compliance within 60 days.''
   Leslie Gersing, a spokeswoman for New York attorney general
Robert Abrams, said the information program was the result of ``an
informal, out-of-court agreement'' and said she did not know if
there were grounds to sue.
   However, she said all three attorneys general have asked
officials from the four companies to meet with Texas attorney
general Jim Mattox to discuss why they have discontinued the
program.
   ``This is something we'd like to do without having to resort to
litigation,'' she said.
   A spokesman for Kentucky Fried Chicken said brochures are sent
to restaurants but they are not required to give them out. ``The
deal was that the (1986) agreement was voluntary,'' said Dick
Detwiler, the company's director of public affairs.
   In his letter to the state officials, Jacobson said consumers
need to know, for example, that McDonald's and Burger King fry
their potatoes in beef fat, that McDonald's Chicken McNuggets
contain ground-up chicken skin, that Burger King's Whopper with
Cheese contains 711 calories and that milkshakes often contain
artificial colorings.
   The consumer group surveyed restaurants in Virginia, Louisiana,
Ohio, Wyoming, New Mexico, Texas, California and New York in
addition to Washington, D.C.
   Jacobson said the center's survey showed that:
   _Of 14 Burger King outlets surveyed, none had signs and only six
had brochures. Customers who requested information were told to
write or call corporate headquarters.
   Spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said Burger King provides all its
restaurants with nutritional guides and requires company-owned
outlets to distribute them. ``This is the first complaint that
we've received,'' she said. ``We certainly will go back and take a
look ourselves and, if they are not being given out, remedy the
situation.''
   _Kentucky Fried Chicken is creating a new brochure and not
distributing the old one, which didn't contain ingredient
information anyway. Customers ho requested information were told to
contact corporate headquarters. Stores were not required to keep
brochures on hand and only three of 13 surveyed had any.
   Detwiler, the company spokesman, said Monday that the new
brochure has been sent to outlets, which may or may not distribute
them. Asked about ingredient listings and signs, he said, ``I'm not
aware that we ever agreed to provide anything other than
nutritional information.''
   _McDonald's has a policy that all outlets are supposed to have
booklets and signs but the policy is being ignored by many of their
stores. Only eight of 18 stores surveyed had brochures.
   Spokeswoman Terri Capatosto said McDonald's never entered into
any agreement except a one-year program to distribute nutrition
information in New York. But she said that ``we provide complete
ingredient information at our restaurants. We send it to our
restaurants regularly and it is available at all times from the
nutrition information center'' at corporate headquarters.
   _Wendy's tells customers who want information to write to
corporate headquarters. One California Wendy's had a sign noting
the availability of product information but had no brochures on
hand. None of 14 stores surveyed had any.
   ``They might have run out of them,'' said Wendy's spokesman
Denny Lynch. ``That's easily fixed. We'll just remind our
restaurant operators that the ingredient and nutrition brochures
are available and ask them to have a supply on hand.''

   Robert E. Boni is stepping down as chief
executive officer of Armco Inc. effective at the April 27
shareholders' meeting but will remain as chairman, the company
announced Monday.
   Robert L. Purdum, 54, Armco's president and chief operating
officer, will become chief executive officer at the annual meeting.
   A statement issued by company headquarters in Parsippany, N.J.,
said Boni, 62, will devote his time to board matters and to
strategy and technology planning, working with Purdum.
   ``This change in organization is part of a succession plan we
have had in place for some years,'' Boni said.
   He said he and Purdum ``have worked together over the past five
difficult years, first to survive, then to build the company into a
strong, competitive force in the industry. I have found his
operating knowledge and experience to be unparalleled and his
business instincts acute.''
   Purdum is a Purdue University graduate with a degree in civil
engineering. He joined Armco's former Metal Products Division in
1962 after serving in the Navy. After several promotions, he was
transferred to steel division headquarters in Middletown as general
manager-administration in 1976.
   In February 1978, he became president of the Midwestern Steel
Division and two years later was named area vice president with
responsibility for four divisions.
   In 1982, he became CEO of the Steel Group and, on Feb. 1, 1985,
was named chief operating officer of Armco Inc. He was elected
president of the company Oct. 1, 1986, and is a member of the board.
   Armco, with Japan's Kawasaki Steel Corp., owns Armco Steel Co.,
a joint venture which operates steel mills in Middletown and in
Ashland, Ky.

<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp.'s chief executive
attacked the motives and management skills of Harold C. Simmons,
the Texas financier who leads a group that is seeking control of
the aerospace company's board.
   Daniel M. Tellep, in interviews Sunday, defended his record in
the year since he became chairman and chief executive. He cited
recent cost-cutting and restructuring at Lockheed, and said Simmons
has never taken him up on repeated invitations to discuss the
company's future.
   ``We're completely open to future options,'' Tellep told the
Wall Street Journal. ``But he has never put forward his ideas.''
   Simmons has gained control of 18.9 percent of Lockheed's stock,
and is attempting to overturn ``poison pill'' provisions adopted by
the Calabasas-based company that make it prohibitively expensive
for an outsider to acquire more than 20 percent of the shares.
   He has proposed his own directors for the company, which elects
a board March 29 at its annual shareholders meeting. Simmons'
nominees include Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the former chief of naval
operations, and former Sen. John G. Tower, who headed the Senate
Armed Services Committee _ names intended to defuse critics who say
he has no experience in running a defense contractor.
   Tellep told the Los Angeles Times that Simmons' only ``concrete
plan'' for the company so far ``is a plan for taking over.''
   ``Shareholders will have to ask themselves: `What about this
uncertainty?''' he said.
   He was unavailable for interviews Monday, Lockheed spokesman
Robert Slayman said. Simmons did not return phone calls.
   Simmons' slate of 15 candidates for the Lockheed board also
includes himself and J. Landis Martin, the president and chief
executive of Simmons-controlled N.L. Industries, a Houston-based
chemical company that has accumulated the 18.9 percent of
Lockheed's shares.
   Tellep cautioned against any breakup of Lockheed's major
operating units. ``If someone started breaking it up ... the parts
couldn't help each other,'' he said. ``Any split-up diminishes the
value of the whole.''
   ``Our board stacks up well compared to Simmons','' he added.
   Separately Sunday, Lockheed's machinists ended six months of
negotiations by voting to accept a 3{-year contract. The contract
covers about 128,000 members of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers at company plants in Palmdale,
Burbank, Sunnyvale, and Marietta, Ga.
   It provides 4 percent wage scale increases or bonuses
retroactive to October and an immediate $2,500 signing bonus for
all workers under the contract and currently on payroll.
   Wages will rise 7 percent over the final two years of the
contract, which runs until March 1993.
   Under the pact, the firm can match employee contributions to a
company-sponsored savings plan by using Lockheed stocks. The new
Employee Stock Ownership Plan is slated to begin in July.
   Lockheed management successfully obtained a 6 percent employee
contribution for dependent medical care. It also won a two-tier
wage scale that would create a lower salary range for newly hired
workers in certain jobs.
   In addition, the contract calls for roughly 20 percent of
covered workers to receive quarterly bonuses, rather than an
increase in wage scales, during the first year of the pact. That
percentage will rise to about 47 percent of all workers by the
contract's third year.

<HEAD>Motorola Unveils New Computer Line, More Aggressive Strategy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. on Monday unveiled a new computer
line that the technology company hopes will propel it into the
industry's major leagues.
   But some industry analysts said Motorola could end up alienating
companies that buy its computers for resale under their own brand
names. Others questioned whether Motorola stands a chance in the
highly competitive computer field.
   ``Motorola is doing so many great things in other parts of the
company, you hate to be negative about their computer effort, but I
don't think it has too much prospect for success,'' said Richard L.
Whittington of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The new computers are designed to operate in a network with
machines made by other companies, such as IBM and Apple. They are
based on the Unix operating system, which is becoming the industry
standard.
   Motorola said the computers undercut the price of a similar line
of IBM machines by 35 percent and more, while offering comparable
or better performance. The IBM computers, which were introduced
with great fanfare last month, were praised by experts for their
low price relative to peformance.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has made computers for
years, but they primarily have been sold to the federal government
or to other computer companies that resell them under their own
names.
   The new computers are ``file servers,'' an increasingly popular
form of desktop or side-of-desk machine that serves as the central
data repository for a network of desktop terminals.
   Analysts generally are impressed by the new Motorola computers,
which they said are competitive with the best in the field.
   John Rymer, managing editor of the trade publication Unix in the
Office, said he believes Motorola's strategy is similar to that of
Intel Corp., a computer-chip maker that also makes complete
computers it sells to third parties for reselling. He said these
chip makers hope to leverage their microprocessor expertise to
become major computer manufacturers.
   Some of the companies that buy Intel chips to make computers
have criticized Intel for its strategy, saying it is not fair for
their supplier of the most crucial part of a computer to also
compete in the end product.
   However, one major user of Motorola chips welcomes the company's
new strategy.
   Data General Corp. uses Motorola's 88000 chip, the same one used
in the new Motorola machines, in its computer workstations. Stan
Dolberg, marketing manager for the workstations, said the market
for computers based on this chip is relatively small and additional
players are needed to help establish it.
   N.V. Philips, the Dutch electronics company, uses a relabeled
Motorola computer as the heart of its computer line outside the
United States. Philips spokesman Cor Vraven said he had no comment
on Motorola's strategy because it was his understanding Motorola
had no immediate plan to sell the computers overseas.
   However, Motorola spokeswoman Karen Simeone said the company
planned to distribute the computers abroad starting in May.
   Analysts say Motorola needs to improve its marketing and
distribution to become a major seller of computers in its own
right. To this end, the company has launched a $30 million
advertising campaign.
   Motorola's machines, called the MultiPersonal Computer line,
range in price from about $24,000 to $60,000. Each system comes
with three desktop screens and a processing unit.
   Each also is equipped with a local-area network, which is a
cable and related software than allows various computers and
printers from other companies to be linked.
   The new machines, which will be available in May, are aimed at
the commercial computer market instead of the engineering and
scientific customers that often are the target for file servers and
for workstations, which are similar to file servers.

   The dollar fell sharply against most major
foreign currencies Monday as central banks joined in an effort to
hold down the currency's value.
   Gold prices climbed. In New York, gold rose $1.10 a troy ounce
to $404.10 on the Commodity Exchange, and Republic National Bank
later quoted a bid of $404.30 a troy ounce, up $1.05 from Friday.
   The Federal Reserve sold dollars twice in an effort to lower its
value, dealers said. The intervention followed dollar-selling by
central banks in Europe and Japan, which also depressed the dollar.
   Thomas J. Palladino, a currency trader with Amsterdam Rotterdam
Bank in New York, said the concerted intervention overseas before

   After the Federal Reserve sold dollars, ``the market did not

   ``It seemed like they intervened pretty aggressively or the

comment on its market interventions.
   Similar intervention Friday by central banks in Europe and Japan

<HEAD>McCaw Completes $3 Billion of Controlling Interest in LIN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said Monday it
had completed its $3.38 billion acquisition of a controlling
interest in LIN Broadcasting Corp., extending its influence in the
booming cellular telephone industry.
   McCaw said the completion of its tender offer for 21.9 million
shares of LIN Broadcasting Corporation at $154.11 per share gives
it a 51.9 percent interest in LIN. McCaw previously owned about 5
million shares of LIN.
   In New York, LIN announced it had replaced its chairman and
chief executive officer and elected a new board of directors
dominated by McCaw, which is headquartered in Kirkland, Wash., a
Seattle suburb.
   ``Our major regional cellular systems in conjunction with LIN's
major markets provide the building blocks for creating the
independent, seamless national cellular telephone network we have
long envisioned,'' Craig O. McCaw, chairman and chief executive
officer of McCaw, said in a statement.
   About 46.3 million LIN shares were tendered. Based on the
preliminary count, the proration factor would be approximately 47.3
percent.
   The proration determines what percentage of shares offered by
each stockholder will be accepted for payment at the price McCaw
offered. Additional shares will be returned to the owner.
   McCaw said the final proration on the shares will be announced
by March 13, at which time the funds McCaw paid Monday to the
depositary, Chemical Bank, will be distributed.
   The new nine-member LIN board, elected early Monday, includes
three independent directors named by the outgoing LIN board and six
directors associated with McCaw.
   The new board set March 20 as the record date for the
distribution to LIN shareholders, other than McCaw and its
affiliates, of $425 million of McCaw Cellular Class A common stock
as a dividend.
   LIN expects to distribute the stock to stockholders of record,
other than McCaw and its affiliates, on or about April 2.
   The board also elected Craig O. McCaw as chairman of the board
and chief executive officer of LIN and Paul H. Stolz as president
and chief operating officer. They replaced Donald A. Pels, who was
formerly chairman, president and chief executive officer at LIN.
   McCaw is the largest U.S. cellular telephone company. The LIN
acquisition gives it access to cellular franchises held by LIN in
the metropolitan areas of New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston.
   LIN also owns and operates seven network-affiliated television
stations and publishes magazines placed in hotel rooms.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp said Monday it was considering the sale
of AMBAC Indemnity Corp., one month after federal regulators
ordered the bank to put up more reserves to cover liabilities of
its bond insurance subsidiary.
   Citicorp said in a statement the decision was part of a review
of businesses aimed at strengthening its capital base. AMBAC
Indemnity is wholly owned by Citibank NA, Citicorp's banking arm.
   Last month, the federal Comptroller of the Currency, which
regulates commercial banks, and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Citibank would have to consolidate AMBAC Indemnity's
earnings on its balance sheet.
   That would require Citibank to increase AMBAC's capital
reserves, which could cause a drain on the bank's earnings.
   AMBAC Indemnity, which is registered in Wisconsin and
headquartered in New York, insures issues of municipal bonds and
other tax-exempt securities. It stands for American Municipal Bond
Assurance Corp.
   Citicorp said AMBAC Indemnity had about 33 percent market share
at the end of last year and capital of about $700 million.
   AMBAC Indemnity would not be sold, Citicorp said, ``unless an
attractive proposal is made by a high-quality, well-capitalized
institution with a long-term perspective on its investment in
AMBAC.''

<TEXT>
   Leo Melamed, a tireless innovator and cheerleader
for the futures industry, announced Monday that he would resign
from the leadership of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange at year's
end ``to recapture my life.''
   Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, explained
the surprise announcement by saying that after 23 years of policy
making and trend setting, he was ready for a quieter life.
   ``I really want to recapture my life,'' he said at a news
conference. ``I want to smell the flowers along the way while I can
still smell something.''
   Melamed, 57, said he was not retiring for health reasons or for
reasons associated with the ongoing federal investigation of fraud
at the Merc and the larger Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two
biggest futures markets.
   He said he planned to continue trading futures through his
trading company, Dellsher Investment Company Inc., to write and to
spend more time with his family.
   Melamed also said he expects the Merc to launch its Globex
electronic trading system, one of his pet projects, by June 30.
Implementation has been delayed in part due to trouble in getting
approval from the Japanese government for Japanese companies to
trade on the system.
   The charismatic and outspoken Melamed is widely recognized as
the father of financial futures, which are risk-management tools
for the financial industry.
   Before Melamed, the futures exchanges were best known for
trading agricultural commodities. The development of financial
futures, beginning with the Merc's introduction of foreign currency
futures in 1972, fueled explosive growth in the industry and
brought futures exchanges respectability in the financial world.
   Melamed was chairman of the Merc from 1969 until 1971, when he
stepped aside to become chairman of a newly created affiliate, the
International Monetary Market. In 1976, IMM merged with the Merc
and Melamed became chairman of the combined institutions.
   A Polish immigrant, Melamed began working as a runner at the
Merc in the early 1950s while working his way through law school.
He became an exchange member in 1954 and a member of the exchange's
board of governors in 1967.
   In 1977, the Merc board created the office of special counsel to
the board and named Melamed to the position and to the position of
chairman of the executive committee.
   The Merc board has yet to name a successor to Melamed.

   Wall Street money manager Fred Alger has
settled an administrative action with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the SEC said.
   Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fred Alger
Management Inc. settled an SEC proceeding charging that FAM filed
an allegedly misleading registration statement for The Alger Fund.
   The SEC claimed the registration statement did not completely
disclose the performance of FAM-managed accounts from 1965 through
1986.
   Specificially, the SEC said that in advertising a 21.2 percent
annual compound growth rate over 21 years, FAM did not disclose
that one of the accounts with a high rate of return did not have to
accept FAM's advice, and in one case rejected it.
   The settlement announced Monday called for FAM to comply with
all SEC regulations.

   A federal judge in New York has extended a
court order freezing the brokerage accounts of two foreign
companies accused of insider trading in the stock of Rorer Group
Inc., federal officials said Monday.
   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kramm ruled last Thursday that
she had the jurisdiction to freeze the assets of Unifund SAL, a
Lebanese corporation, and Tamanaco Saudi &amp; Gulf Investment Group, a
Panamanian concern, officials with the Securities and Exchange
Commission said Monday.
   She continued a Jan. 17 court order freezing Unifund's brokerage
account, valued at $3.7 million, and Tamanaco's brokerage account,
worth $680,000, which allegedly contain the proceeds from their
Rorer trading.
   They are among four foreign companies accused of trading on
confidential corporate information that Rorer, a Fort Washington,
Pa. pharmaceutical company, was in merger talks with a French
company, Rhone-Poulenc SA.
   The two companies agreed in January to merge their
pharmaceutical operations, with Rhone-Poulenc acquiring 68 percent
of Rorer's stock in a deal valued at about $3 billion.

<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Co., pulled off
the auction block in January, has reached a five-year deal to
distribute much sought-after films from Pathe Communications Co.,
the companies said Monday.
   The deal had been widely expected to go to Warner Bros., but MGM
and Pathe officials said a final contract was never signed.
   Nevertheless, Warner spokesman Rob Friedman insisted his studio
already had reached an agreement with Pathe, even though he would
not describe it.
   ``Warner has a deal as far as we're concerned,'' Friedman said.
``We've been working on their movies for a couple of months.''
   The releases from the Pathe subsidiary, Alan Ladd Jr.'s Pathe
Entertainment, include ``Russia House'' with Sean Connery and
Michelle Pfeiffer at Christmas and ``Quigley Down Under'' with Tom
Selleck and Laura San Giacomo this fall.
   MGM-UA said it will boost the number of major films it releases
in theaters to at least 15 this year. That is good news for the
studio, which virtually shut down movie production of its own for
most of two years while controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian
looked for a buyer.
   The Hollywood Reporter, an entertainment trade paper, quoted
unidentified ``insiders'' as saying that continuing negotiations
could lead to Pathe Communications or its head, Giancarlo Parretti,
buying MGM-UA. Under one scenario, Warner might pick up
distribution rights to the 1,000-picture UA library, MGM-UA's
biggest asset, the paper said.
   Friedman and Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons declined to comment
on the report. Parretti, an Italian financier and restaurant owner,
was among those who considered buying MGM-UA when it was up for
sale, but Parsons said he had no knowledge of any recent talks.
   MGM-UA has started up its own production again, but for now must
depend largely on distributing movies from independent production
companies like Pathe.
   ``It gives them some great product, and they need it right
now,'' said Alex Ben Block, editor of the industry newsletter Show
Biz News.
   Pathe will finance the costs of the films and oversee marketing
and distribution. MGM gets exclusive distribution rights to home
video releases as well as domestic theatrical releases. Other
details weren't released.
   ``This arrangement reaffirms MGM-UA's ability and commitment to
supply major motion pictures to all media,'' Jeffrey C. Barbakow,
the company's chairman, said in a statement.
   Australia's Qintex group outbid Rupert Murdoch's Fox studio for
MGM-UA last year, but the deal collapsed when Qintex failed to line
up financing. Cable TV baron Ted Turner then discussed a buyout _
he already owns most rights to the old MGM film library _ but those
merger talks died in January and Kerkorian said he would go back to
the business of making movies.
   Many observers believe Kerkorian's goal remains to sell MGM-UA.
Jeffrey Logsdon, a securities analyst with the Crowell Weedon
brokerage in Los Angeles, said the company may have aggressively
outbid Warner for the Pathe deal to help ``create the illusion they
are a full-fledged company, with product in the pipeline.''
   ``That's got to always be in the back of one's mind, anyway,''
he said.
   In addition to ``Russia House'' and ``Quigley Down Under,''
MGM-UA will distribute such Pathe films as ``Fires Within,''
starring Jimmy Smits; ``Not Without My Daughter,'' starring Sally
Field and ``Life Stinks,'' written and directed by and starring Mel
Brooks.
   The theatrical release of 15 films this year brings MGM-UA to
what once was a standard level for a major studio, although such
studios as Disney, Fox and Warner are now trying for about double
that number each year as worldwide demand soars for Hollywood
entertainment.
   To help keep the company's distribution network intact, the
president of MGM-UA's film group, Richard Berger, spent $9 million
this year for rights to ``Desperate Hours,'' a Mickey Rourke film
directed by Michael Cimino and produced by Dino De Laurentiis to be
released this summer.
   MGM-UA also has its old faithfuls fired up, with a Thanskgiving
release set for ``Rocky V'' with Sylvester Stallone and the next
James Bond movie under way and planned for release in summer 1991.
   The company also has a number of projects under way starring
John Candy, Sally Field and Steve Martin.

<HEAD>GM Passes Greenmail Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of General Motors Corp.
approved an anti-greenmail policy, prompting a stockholder to
withdraw her proposal against such payoffs.
   The policy approved Monday prohibits the purchase of shares at
an above-market price from anyone owning more than 3 percent of the
voting power of the corporation's stock. The policy applies only if
the stockholder has held his or her shares for less than two years.
   Shareholder Evelyn Y. Davis of Washington, D.C., proposed a ban
on greenmail three years ago after GM paid H. Ross Perot and some
associates $750 million for their Class E stock in exchange for his
leaving the company. Perot founded Electronic Data Systems and had
sold it to GM a few years before.
   Most shareholder proposals attract only a tiny fraction of
votes, but hers garnered 20 percent the first year and nearly 28
percent last year.
   ``There was a growing stockholder interest in having a formal
statement or formal policy in opposition to greenmail,'' GM
spokesman William B. Winters said.
   In a statement, GM said it has consistently opposed the payment
of greenmail.
   ``This adoption of an explicit policy reinforces its belief that
the corporation's funds must be employed for the benefit of all
stockholders,'' the company said.

   Students across the country got the news
along with a sales pitch for candy, shaving razors and cheese
snacks Monday as the advertiser-supported classroom program Channel
One went on the air.
   ``I think it is a good idea,'' said Powell High School student
Jim Addington, 17, one of the first to see the Channel One news
program, beamed to 400 schools nationwide.
   ``I don't see why there is so much controversy over the
commercials,'' he added, noting he'd seen Channel One's ads for
M&amp;Ms, Gillette shavers and Chee-tos before on his television at
home. ``I thought the programming was good. I think it will work.''
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of the Knoxville-based Whittle
Communications that produced the show, agrees.
   Despite criticism from national education groups and bans by
public educators in New York and California, Whittle told a news
conference at the high school that 2,900 schools in 34 states have
signed up for Channel One. And he predicted a total of 8,000 would
be committed by December.
   ``I predict that within 5 years a system like this will be in 95
percent of all middle and high schools in the United States. In a
sense, it will be a new institution in America's schools,'' he said.
   But Timothy Dyer, executive director of the National Association
of Secondary School Principals, worried that Channel One, which
already has been tested in a number of schools, marked the
beginning of ``the commercialization of the classroom.''
   Added Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television
in Cambridge, Mass.: ``It's obvious that schools signing on to
Whittle's operation are doing it for the free TV sets. I think it
is outrageous to barter pieces of the school day in return for a
mess of equipment ... and to use that equipment to keep reminding
children of how much they need particular products.''
   Monday's broadcast by Channel One's five-member team of under-30
anchors and reporters gave a capsule of breaking news _ voting in
three Soviet republics, the escape of a 17-year-old Cuban to the
United States on a sailboard, the return of the space shuttle
Atlantis and President Bush's talks with Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   The program, produced in New York and sent by satellite to the
participating schools, had longer stories on a Japanese high school
in Tennessee and an Army recruiting office in Kentucky.
   Maps preceded several of the stories to show where the action
was taking place. Students interviewed approved. ``It gives you a
perspective of where it is actually happening,'' said Stacey
Surber, 16. ``It gives you a better understanding.''
   The program also contained the first of five daily reports on
the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. ``I like the way it combined
history with news. It showed what was happening in the `40s,'' said
Gabe Thrasher, 16.
   The 12-minute program was interspersed with two minutes of
30-second commercials. The fourth ad was an anti-drug public
service announcement.
   Al Poe, spokesman for M&amp;M-Mars Inc., said that while the
Hackettstown, N.J., candy company believes that subscribing to
Channel One is a ``local community matter,'' it deserves corporate
support.
   ``Everyone wins with the Whittle concept _ students, school
systems, communities and the sponsors,'' Poe said. ``Our experience
has been that situations like this tend to be productive for a long
time.''
   Whittle said 29 advertisers, whom he wouldn't name, have
contracted to run commercials on Channel One at $150,000 per
30-second spot. Ads for tobacco, alcohol, political and religious
groups and contraceptives are rejected.
   ``We have 65 percent of our commercial time sold for the first
three years,'' Whittle said. ``It is, from a business standpoint,
the most successful television launch ever.
   ``There is widespread support for this in the corporate
community for two reasons _ they think it is good business, but
they think it is good education, too. And they see this as a way
that they can help schools.''
   Whittle said commercials are necessary in order to pay for the
$150 million in video equipment loaned to the schools that show the
program and the $90 million in annual operational expenses to
produce it.
   Earl Hoffmeister, superintendent of the 50,000-student Knox
County school system, said the televisions, video recorders and
satellite dishes provided by Whittle for Channel One separate it
from other programming geared to teen-agers, such as Turner
Broadcasting System Inc.'s ``CNN Newsroom'' that has been carried
since August on Cable News Network.
   ``We think it is a tool that will help many many school systems,
as our own school system, in being able to do some things that we
either do not have the money for or a teacher is not available,''
Hoffmeister said, adding that the school system planned to use the
equipment for other programming.
   What effect Channel One's commercials will have remains to be
seen. Both teachers and students said Monday they tended to ignore
them. ``It's almost like when you watch TV (at home),'' Miss Surber
said. ``When the commercials come on ... you don't even want to
watch, really.''

   The union representing striking Greyhound bus
drivers on Monday aske the company to return to the bargaining
table to end the 4-day-old walkout against the United States' only
nationwide bus system.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Greyhound Lines Inc. acknowledged the
company was losing some of the drivers it had hired to replace
strikers.
   The strike has been marred by violence and vandalism since 6,300
drivers and more than 3,000 office and maintenance workers walked
out early Friday. Shots have been fired at buses, and a striking
driver was killed Saturday in Redding, Calif., when he was crushed
by a bus backing up to get around a picket line.
   In Los Angeles on Monday, a Superior Court judge ordered
striking Greyhound drivers in the southwestern United States not to
interfere with the work of newly hired replacement drivers.
   The temporary restraining order by Judge David Yaffe applies to
strikers from Los Angeles to El Paso and also bars picketers from
intimidating replacement drivers with ``fear of bodily harm or
death.''
   Union officials on Monday sent a message to Greyhound Chairman
Fred G. Currey requesting a meeting with him as soon as possible.
   The message asked Currey to contact Ed Strait, president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, or Jim La Sala,
international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company tried but
failed to contact La Sala after receiving the request Monday, and
is again awaiting word from the union.
   There have been no formal negotiations since talks broke off
early Friday. Strait met briefly Friday night with P. Anthony
Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president and chief negotiator.
   At that point, Lannie said the union had no new proposals. Union
spokesman Jeffrey Nelson would not say Monday if the drivers had a
revised offer to make to the company.
   The two sides entered negotiations last week far apart. The
company said it couldn't afford more than the $63 million contract
it was offering. The union claimed its offer was lower than
management's, but the company valued that offer at more than $200
million.
   The company has been operating with 700 replacement drivers plus
any union members who cross picket lines.
   Currey said 350 union drivers are at work and the company is
providing about 29 percent of its normal service. The union says
only 95 members have crossed picket lines.
   Sources close to the union claimed Monday that some replacement
drivers have walked off the job, including 32 in the company's
central region, which stretches along the northern third of the
country from just west of Pittsburgh to west of Denver.
   An internal message sent to some Greyhound officials says the
company is having to lower its level of service in the region
partly due to the loss of newly hired drivers.
   Gravley said the change was forced because not as many
replacements were hired for that area as had been expected, and did
not reflect defections.
   ``There have been a few of them that have left,'' he said, ``and
we are not surprised by that. They knew what they were getting
into. These people were recruited and they were told honestly and
forthrightly ... the nature of the work.
   ``We told them that there could be times when they might be
intimidated.''
   There have been several incidents of strikers pounding the sides
of buses as they crossed picket lines. In Chicago on Friday, shots
were fired at a departing bus.
   On Sunday, charter bus drivers in Spokane, Wash., found bus
electrical systems vandalized, and a passenger in Philadelphia was
charged with spraying a striker with Mace.
   The AFL-CIO on Monday asked its other member unions to help
striking driver where possible.
   ``Because Greyhound bus riders are primarily students, older and
lower-income Americans, you should continue to work with our allies
in community and minority organizations to carry our message that
scab operations will only prolong the dispute,'' AFL-CIO officials
said in a letter to local officials.

   General Motors Corp. said it would consolidate
its two engine development operations into one organization.
   The move, which combines engine research and development
operations at GM's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac and
Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada groups, is designed to help
streamline the nation's largest automaker.
   ``This action, which will improve our ability to bring great
products more quickly to the marketplace, will greatly benefit our
car and truck division customers,'' GM President Robert Stempel
said Monday.
   In 1984, GM underwent a reorganization that combined five engine
operations into two. Beginning in 1987, GM embarked on its ``Action
Plan'' _ a cost-cutting effort aimed at cutting up to $13 billion
in costs by the end of this year.
   The effective dates of the latest engine consolidation will be
determined later.
   Spokesman Charles Licari said the recommendations were not made
with the goal of idling facilities or laying off workers.
   ``On the other hand we know there are efficiencies to be gained
by integrating the CPC and BOC power train operations,'' Licari
said. ``Our goals will be to grow the business, bring in contract
work and design and manufacture vehicles that help sell vehicles,''
he said.
   General manager for the new division will be Richard M.
Donnelly, product manager of the BOC Powertrain Division.

<HEAD>NBA Sues GTE-Sylvania Over Sweepstakes Tie-in To NBA Championship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

   The National Basketball Association is
crying foul at GTE Corp., accusing the company of trademark
infringement by launching a sweepstakes contest with a tie-in to
the NBA championship series.
   In a lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court, the NBA is
asking for an injunction halting GTE-Sylvania's ``Step Up To The
Line'' Sweepstakes as well as unspecified monetary damages for
alleged trademark infringement and unfair trade practices.
   If the court orders the contest cancelled, the suit asks that
GTE be required to notify all entrants by mail and to run
corrective advertising.
   The NBA said the contest is substantially similar to a
sweepstakes being conducted by Frito-Lay Inc., which paid a
``substantial sum'' for the privilege to link its contest to the
NBA Finals.
   ``The GTE Sweepstakes is ... simply an attempt to take
plaintiffs' valuable property rights by improperly associating
themselves with the good will and reputation of the NBA,'' the suit
said.
   A spokesman for Stamford-based GTE, said Monday the company
could not comment on the suit until its attorneys had a chance to
study it.
   Full-page advertisements for the GTE sweepstakes appeared in
inserts in newspapers and magazines nationwide on Feb. 18.
According to the suit, the ads were constructed and designed ``to
imply and suggest the sponsorship, endorsement or approval of the
NBA.''
   Ryan Partnership, a Stamford marketing firm, sought permission
in November to use the NBA trademarks for a GTE sweepstakes but was
denied, the suit said. A woman who answered the telephone at Ryan
said there was no one available to comment.
   The NBA said it sent a letter to GTE and Ryan on Feb. 26
demanding they call a halt to the contest, but that the defendants
refused.
   The GTE-Sylvania sweepstakes ad invites entrants, in the body of
the promotion, to ``win a trip to the championship finals and a
share of $25,000 in prizes.''
   In smaller print, readers are advised that four grand prize
winners will receive an expense-paid trip for a family of four to
the first two games of the NBA championship finals, and that
prize-winners will participate in a free-throw shoot-out with
$25,000 in prizes.
   In addition, the official entry form states, ``Yes, I would like
to win a trip to the NBA Championship Finals and a share of $25,000
in prizes.''
   The NBA said GTE has not been authorized to conduct any
free-throw contest in connection with the championship series, but
that the ad falsely suggests otherwise.
   Entrants in the Frito-Lay contest, on the other hand, are vying
for the opportunity to win a trip to the NBA playoffs and the
chance to compete in a free-throw shooting contest during half-time
of a conference playoff game or during Game 4 of the finals, the
NBA said.

<HEAD>Dollar Sharply Lower, Stocks Gain</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Udpates with morning Nikkei, dollar, bond prices</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was sharply lower against the Japanese
yen Tuesday and the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
moderately.
   Trading remained light during the morning as many investors
stayed on the sidelines anticipating the Bank of Japan would
increase interest rates, possibly during the afternoon.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average recouped 120.52 points, or
0.36 percent, ending the morning session at 33,965.72. On Monday,
the index lost 212.36 points.
   The dollar ended the morning session at 148.77 yen, down 1.18
yen from Monday's close. It had opened at 148.97 yen and weakened
during the morning as the Bank of Japan sold dollars actively to
support its currency.
   The yen's rebound sparked a rally in the Japanese government
bond market that pushed down interest rates. The yield on the
benchmark No. 119 10-year bond fell to 7.075 percent from 7.12
percent late Monday.
   The dollar continued to weaken in Tokyo after falling against
almost all major currencies in overseas markets earlier following
internationally coordinated intervention, traders said.
   Central banks from Japan, Britain, France and West Germany
bought their own currencies and sold the dollar in an attempt to
weaken the U.S. currency, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange
analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   Finance Minsiter Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters Tuesday that
the framework of international cooperation remains strong and
coordinated action will continue to be taken to ensure stability in
foreign exchange markets.
   He said U.S. concern over the dollar-yen rate was made clear at
last weekend's summit meeting between U.S. President Bush and
Japanese Prime Minster Toshiki Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif.
   In rising above 150 yen in recent days, the dollar hit its
highest level since last June.
   The Bank of Japan was seen selling some $1 billion Tuesday
morning to bolster the yen, traders said. The central bank does not
comment on its market intervention activities.
   ``Many market players are now trying to reduce their
dollar-holding positions now, in case the Bank of Japan raises its
discount rate today,'' Kanai said.
   ``That's mainly because they speculate there might be a raise
before central bank Governor Mr. (Yasushi) Mieno leaves for Europe
tomorrow, and they think there will be no hike while he's gone
until (March) 15,'' he added.
   Japanese markets have been expecting a discount rate hike to
stem inflationary pressures ever since the nation held major
parliamentary elections last month. After three hikes last year,
the nation's key lending rate stands at 4.25 percent, still the
lowest among the group of seven industrial nations.
   Partly as a result of the Bank of Japan's inaction, growing
uncertainties in the market began discouraging stock investment and
yen-buying, causing a rapid decline in share prices and leading to
a 1,569.10-point plunge Feb. 26, the second-worst fall ever.
   On the stock exchange, dealers attributed the morning rally to
the yen's strength as well as the rise in the government bond
prices.
