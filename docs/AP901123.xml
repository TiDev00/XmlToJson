<TEXT>
   For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was
regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted
ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of
administration policies.
   Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in
1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya. In the Persian Gulf
crisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the
Middle East.
   ``You always know where she was and what she believed,'' Bush
said upon hearing of her decision to resign. ``She has always been
an outstanding ally of the United States,'' he said. ``I will miss
her.''
   There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived in
Washington with an economic program of free-market capitalism that
seemed out of step with the times. Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of the
skeptics; she was advocating a similar program at home.
   They shared rocky relations with organized labor. Reagan
successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing a
devastating blow to labor. She, too, smashed restive unions.
   On foreign policy, she frequently was more right wing than
Reagan - certainly more so than Bush.
   Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the
British prime minister. They were ideological soulmates and called
each other Ronnie and Margaret. At international gatherings, they
usually were side by side.
   Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left
office, the president said he was leaving the White House with
``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher
will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
   She later wrote him a ``Dear Ron'' letter in which she praised
him as ``a great president, one of the greatest.''
   Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.
Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championed
military readiness - even though she was the first to recognize
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.
   Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan
nurtured under the theme of peace through strength. She was a big
backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe
and always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came to
disarmament.
   When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland
Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice
between two allies. Ronnie sided with Margaret.
   Washington's special relationship with London seemed to slip
when Reagan left power. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publicly
last year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese and
Cambodian ``boat people'' who were fleeing their countries to Hong
Kong.
   Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leaders around the
globe. Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.
   The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.
She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the
prized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.
   Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the ``special relationship''
between the United States and Great Britain to remain on a ``steady
keel.''
   Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty. For
awhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of
Gorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, and
appeared uncertain how to respond.
   Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to the
Soviet leader. Now they seem almost best of friends.
   On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible
military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his
threat credible. Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher.
   She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, the
West would have to use military force to dislodge him.
   She called Saddam ``a loser,'' and the state-controlled Iraqi
news agency replied that she was an ``old hag.''
   Now, she is leaving. No one suspects that Britain's new
leadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.
Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting for
Bush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.

   Margaret Thatcher's long and often glorious career
as prime minister will end with a short ride from 10 Downing St. to
Buckingham Palace.
   When the 372 Conservative Party members of the House of Commons
have chosen a new leader next week, tradition prescribes that Mrs.
Thatcher submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II, the head of
state.
   The queen then sends for the winner of the Conservative Party
leadership race to confirm him as prime minister - providing the
monarch believes that person commands  sufficient majority in the
House of Commons to be able to carry on Her Majesty's Government.
   The new prime minister will ``kiss hands'' on appointment. In
past times, the new leader would actually have kissed the monarch's
hands and walked away backwards, but now the term is only an
archaic survival in the language of protocol.
   The meeting takes place in the second floor audience room of the
palace where the prime minister meets with the monarch on Tuesdays
to inform her about government business.
   The room has walls of duck-egg blue, armchairs and sofas in
cream wood, and four paintings: two views by Antonio Canaletto and
two portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, of King George III - who lost
the American colonies at the end of the 18th century - and of the
king's consort (wife), Queen Charlotte.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, is demanding
a general election, arguing that the voters and not a few hundred
lawmakers should choose the nation's leader.
   But there is no constitutional need for a general election until
the government's maximum five-year term expires in mid-1992.
   The new prime minister can go to the monarch at any time and say
he needs the support of the electorate to confirm his position. The
monarch is then bound to call a general election.
   There are two recent precedents for the present situation.
   Harold Macmillan, the Conservative Prime Minister, called the
queen to his hospital bedside in 1963 to announce his intention to
resign. His chosen successor, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, was imposed on
the party lawmakers by their leaders.
   The secret-ballot process which brought down Mrs. Thatcher was
established as a result of the controversy over Douglas-Home's
appointment. Douglas-Home lost the general election a year later to
Labor Party leader Harold Wilson.
   In 1976, Wilson resigned, apparently because he felt worn out,
and the party lawmakers chose James Callaghan as their leader.
   Callaghan served as prime minister until he lost the general
election to Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979.

<HEAD>A Brief Look at the Three Candidates Running To Succeed Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief look at the three Conservative
Party officials seeking to succeed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
as party chief - and thus the nation's leader:
   ---
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MICHAEL HESELTINE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Heseltine, a former defense secretary, calls himself a
Thatcherite. But if his leadership bid succeeds, his government
would likely be as different in style and content from Mrs.
Thatcher's as it's possible to be in the Conservative Party.
   Heseltine, 57, announced his leadership challenge on Nov. 14 and
took a giant step toward becoming prime minister on Tuesday,
forcing Mrs. Thatcher into a second ballot for the party
leadership.
   To a large extent, his appeal to his fellow legislators was that
he was not Mrs. Thatcher: that he would govern by Cabinet
consensus, and that he could help them win re-election by modifying
her unpopular new per capita community charge, commonly known as
the poll tax, and because of his high standing in public opinion
polls.
   One of the major themes has been his ideal of ``caring
capitalism,'' which he has contrasted with the rigorous free-market
approach of the Thatcher years.
   ``I find it difficult to reconcile with what I understand to be
the core of Tory philosophy that there are people sleeping in the
doorways of so many central London streets,'' Heseltine said
recently.
   Although as a Conservative and a self-made millionaire Heseltine
favors a market economy, he believes in a closer relationship
between government and business.
   Heseltine has said he would continue Mrs. Thatcher's tough
policy on the persian Gulf.
   He and his wife, Anne, have three children.

<HEAD>DOUGLAS HURD:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hurd, the foreign secretary, has won respect for his calm
handling of a crisis in the Persian Gulf and another crisis in the
government.
   Hurd, 60, who had supported Mrs. Thatcher's campaign to stay in
power, entered the race to succeed her as soon as she dropped out.
   ``I believe I can unite the party ... and that's why I'm putting
my name forward,'' Hurd said Thursday.
   The silver-haired former diplomat was Northern Ireland secretary
from 1984 to 1985, and Home Secretary from 1985 to 1989, in charge
of law and order and immigration services.
   Mrs. Thatcher appointed him foreign secretary in October 1989 -
fulfillment of an ambition Hurd had cherished through a long
political career.
   Forthright, steely and calm, he played a central role in
Britain's involvement in Persian Gulf.
   Hurd, who is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, began his working life
as a diplomat, then turned to mystery writing and politics.
   The son and grandson of Conservative members of Parliament, Hurd
was educated at Eton and Cambridge, where he received a first-class
honors degree in history.
   Hurd and his second wife, Judith, his former secretary whom he
married after a 1982 divorce, have two small children.
   He has three adult sons by his first marriage.

<HEAD>JOHN MAJOR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Major, at 47 the youngest member of the Thatcher government, won
two top Cabinet posts within a decade of entering politics.
   The chancellor of the exchequer, or treasury secretary, is seen
as one of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's personal choices as
eventual heir.
   A high school drop-out and son of a circus performer, Major is
the self-made man who symbolizes the changes in the Conservative
Party that once was the bastion of Oxford and Cambridge-educated
privilege.
   A onetime laborer, he is the only Cabinet member to have been on
``the dole,'' or welfare, for eight months. He has lived in
suburban comfort and in the tough south London neighborhood of
Brixton, where the family moved when one of his father's business
ventures failed.
   Major's fortunes improved when he joined the Standard Chartered
Bank, where he was an executive for 14 years.
   He was elected to Parliament in 1979, and in 1981 began a
remarkable climb to the top through eight government jobs in as
many years.
   After the June 1987 general election, Major was appointed chief
secretary to the treasury, winning respect for his financial acumen
and developing a reputation for quickly grasping figures and
detail.
   Mrs. Thatcher chose Major as foreign secretary in July 1989 and
he became the top treasury official four months later.
   His year has been a rough one for the British economy, with
rising inflation, high interest rates and growing trade imbalance -
all problems that existed before he took over.
   Tall, bespectacled and gray-haired, Major has a calm, modest
manner that some call dull and others find engaging. He and his
wife, Norma, have been married for 20 years and have a son and a
daughter.

   Some facts on how the leadership change in Britain
will work now that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has announced
her resignation:
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS SELECTED: Citizens of the United
Kingdom do not vote for the prime minister, who is the head of
government. They vote for a local Member of Parliament. The leader
of the party with a majority in the 650-seat House of Commons is
the prime minister.
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RULES FOR ELECTION OF THE PRIME MINISTER: Each party has its own
rules for electing a leader. The Conservative Party, which has a
98-seat majority in the Commons, will choose its new leader by a
secret ballot on Tuesday. If no candidate wins a majority, there
will be a final ballot on Thursday.
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HANDING OVER OF POWER: Mrs. Thatcher remains prime minister of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland until the
governing Conservative Party chooses a new leader next week. At
that time, she will submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.
The party's new leader would meet the monarch soon afterward to be
confirmed as prime minister, probably within an hour.
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TERMS OF OFFICE: Parties are elected to govern for a maximum of
five years, but a British prime minister can call a general
election at any time. The present Conservative government's term
runs out in mid-1992.

   Kuwaiti soldiers in tanks roar
through blowing desert sand for the cameras. Kuwaiti volunteers
practice lethal karate chops in front of photographers. Kuwaiti
refugees tell reporters the horrors of life under the Iraqis.
   It's all part of a stepped-up media campaign by the exiled
Kuwaiti government to keep the plight of Kuwait on newscasts and
front pages around the world.
   ``I want this issue always to be in the minds of people because
as time passes, people may forget,'' said Amal Al-Hamad, who was in
charge of international media in Kuwait's Ministry of Information
and is now running an information office at a Dhahran hotel.
   Nearly four months after the Iraqi invasion of their country,
and with a growing anti-war movement in the United States, the
Kuwaiti government has zeroed in on the hundreds of media
representatives here covering the U.S. military buildup and allied
deployment.
   In the three weeks since her office opened for business,
scarcely a day has passed without a Kuwaiti event, all orchestrated
with the help of The Rendon Group, a Washington public relations
firm.
   ``What we try to do ... is to give the media a clear picture of
what the Iraqis are doing. We are trying to make the world
sympathize with us, sympathize with the truth,'' she said.
   Trips to see the remnants of the Kuwaiti army, talk to Kuwaiti
pilots who flew here after the invasion, and watch Kuwaiti
volunteers train are especially popular.
   The Ministry of Information has also brought government
officials from their exile headquarters in Taif and keeps two
people at the border, looking for fleeing refugees who can provide
insight into the situation inside Kuwait.
   The refugees are then brought here to recount their tales of
Iraqi repression, corruption and murder.
   Some, like Dr. Ali Al-Huwail, go on the record and make
headlines. He told of burying more than 50 Kuwaiti children in one
night with a colleague who witnessed the Iraqis pulling the plugs
on some of their incubators.
   Others cover their faces and refuse to give their names because
they are frightened of what might happen to family members left
behind.
   Mrs. Al-Hamad, who left Kuwait with her family in early October,
said she recognizes that not everyone produces a story: Some may
only provide a few facts, but each adds a piece to the picture.
   The Kuwaiti operation has not always run smoothly, often because
of poor logistics.
   The Kuwaiti government was late in starting a public relations
operation, partly because many employees from the Ministry of
Information are still in Kuwait and all its archives were stolen,
Mrs. Al-Hamad said.
   It now has an office in Cairo and is planning new operations in
London, Syria, northern Africa and other European countries, she
said.
   ``Money is no problem,'' Mrs. Al-Hamad said, though she had no
overall figure on the cost of the international media campaign.
   The Rendon Group was hired because it knew what the Western
media needed, she said.
   John Rendon, the firm's president, said in a telephone interview
that his company was mainly providing technical assistance in Saudi
Arabia, Europe and Arab capitals to help the Kuwaitis get their
message across.
   The first public relations campaign on behalf of Kuwait was
launched in the United States in mid-August by Hill and Knowlton.
It was hired by Citizens for a Free Kuwait, formed by private
Kuwaiti citizens immediately after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.
   Lew Allison, Hill and Knowlton's senior vice president who
arrived in Saudi Arabia on Aug. 22, said his main job has been to
produce TV news of Kuwaitis and transmit it back to Washington. He
said he had worked closely with the Kuwaiti government, especially
when it had no public relations operation here.
   Al Mattern, 40, of Alexandria, Va., who started up Rendon's
Saudi operation, said he felt he was doing ``something worthwhile
for mankind rather than just raise money for political candidates
at home.''
   Mrs. Al-Hamad said the Kuwaitis who staff an office here are all
unpaid volunteers like herself, though some are getting living
expenses.
   ``We are ready to sacrifice,'' she said. ``Even if I succeed in
only 3 percent of what I expect, I think I have done something for
my country.''

<HEAD>Egyptian President's Gamble Paying Off in Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's prudent president,
took an uncharacteristic political gamble in leading Arab
opposition to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   That gamble appears to be paying off, experts say, as Mubarak
hosted Bush for a 19-hour visit starting Thanksgiving night.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and ignited the crisis that has
close to three-quarters of a million soldiers - Iraqi vs. U.S. and
its allies - ready for battle on the Saudi peninsula.
   Until the invasion, Mubarak's leadership style was cautious and
hesitant - many said plodding. But he had laboriously ended a
decade's isolation from the Arabs and was trying to cement Cairo's
position as the natural Arab leader when Saddam undercut him.
   Mubarak, 62 and president for nine years, moved quickly to
marshal Arab forces against Iraq's takeover of its tiny neighbor.
He has stayed in the forefront of the anti-Iraq resistance.
   Alliances were reshaped where necessary. He scrapped a political
and economic grouping with Iraq, Jordan and Yemen. He downgraded
relations markedly with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Mubarak said recently that Egyptian soldiers would not enter
Iraq, even if Bush sent in U.S. troops against Saddam and asked
Mubarak to follow with peacekeeping forces as the Americans
withdrew.
   But the Egyptian leader's comment was merely a restatement of
his policy since he sent the first of 14,000 Egyptians in
mid-August to defend Saudi Arabia from possible Iraqi attack.
   Arab politics being what they are, it was a clever move, said
political science professor Earl Sullivan of American University in
Cairo. It cost him nothing as long as his troop stay on the front
line in Saudi Arabia, and it ensured that Saddam could not proclaim
to the Arabs that their brother Mubarak was a traitor to the Arab
cause.
   ``In terms of domestic politics, he's more respected, in a
stronger position to lead the country. Internationally he looks
like a statesman and a leader, not a follower,'' said Sullivan, who
has followed Middle Eastern politics since coming to the university
in 1973.
   Lucius D. Battle, U.S. ambassador to Cairo during the 1960s,
praised Mubarak for holding the course despite billions of dollars
the crisis has cost Egypt's strapped economy.
   The experience has not been all negative. The United States has
shown its appreciation by writing off almost $7 billion in military
debts. Saudi Arabia and other gulf Arabs forgave another $7
billion. And Cairo is expecting a receptive ear next week in Paris
when it asks further debt relief from mainly Western creditor
nations that would put Egypt's foreign debt at half the crippling
$50 billion it was on Aug. 1.
   Despite that, said Battle, Egypt's economy has suffered a net
loss since the turmoil began.
   Battle, retired director of Washington's Middle East Institute,
said Mubarak has performed ``extraordinarily well'' in difficult
circumstances.
   ``He has a real need for a relationship with United States,
partly economic and partly political,'' Battle said from his home
in Washington.
   At the same time, he said, Egypt cannot surrender leadership of
the Arabs to Saddam or anybody else.
   ``I think he has had economic incentive, yes, and political
incentive to exert himself in the Arab world in a leadership role.
I think that's in their interest, and I think it's in our
interest,'' said Battle.
   ``A much-needed requirement for us is stability in that area.
Mubarak is sensible, he's moderate, as steady and as sturdy as
we're likely to get there,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago, Lech Walesa and Tadeusz
Mazowiecki were sharing strikers' rations and walking arm-in-arm to
topple Communist rule. They won the war but lost each other.
   On Sunday, 27 million voters in Poland's first popular
presidential election will write the final chapter to Eastern
Europe's most celebrated political divorce - deciding which of them
will hold the nation's highest office.
   The polls say Walesa is far ahead. The strong-willed Solidarity
chairman who inspires some and frightens others is striving to cap
his amazing biography by succeeding his former Communist nemesis,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, as president.
   Mazowiecki, the cautious and equally stubborn prime minister, is
opposing him.
   And now a dark horse has emerged. A wealthy, mystery-shrouded
emigre businessman, Stanislaw Tyminski, has returned after 21 years
in Canada and Peru. His fresh face, free-spending campaign and
sharp attacks on familiar leaders have garnered him enough support
to overtake Mazowiecki in at least one pre-election survey.
   Three remaining candidates - ex-Communist Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewski, Peasant Party hopeful Roman Bartoszcze and Leszek
Moczulski of the rightist Confederation for an Independent Poland -
have failed to generate significant backing.
   If nobody wins a majority, the contest goes to a runoff Dec. 9.
   The president will be sworn in before the National Assembly by
Christmas. The election is the first in Eastern Europe in which the
electorate is not voting primarily against the former Communist
system. Rather, it is choosing between differing visions of the new
democratic system.
   Walesa, the technical-school educated electrician who has led
Solidarity from its birth in 1980 and won the 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize for his defense of workers' rights, is dynamic and volatile.
His opponents say he could become a dictator or at least
destabilize the country.
   Mazowiecki is a Catholic journalist and ex-political prisoner
who in August 1989 with Walesa's backing became East Europe's first
non-Communist head of government. His opponents say he is reluctant
to take action and will not move fast enough to satisfy public
moods, risking a social explosion.
   Walesa and Mazowiecki were allies until the dissolution of their
former common opponent, the Communist Party, in January. Over the
next few months, Walesa began agitating from Gdansk to replace the
president and the 65 percent of the lower parliament chamber that
has been conceded to the Communists in a power-sharing bargain by
Solidarity last year.
   Adopting the slogan of ``acceleration,'' he also demanded
quicker privatization of the 80 percent of the economy owned by the
state, removal of the old Communist elite from powerful positions
and speedy withdrawal of the Soviet army.
   Mazowiecki responded that he shared the same goals, but that
everything must be accomplished gradually through the building of a
state of law. Mazowiecki's supporters in Warsaw accused Walesa of
acting out of personal ambition and suggested he leave the running
of Poland to experts.
   By the summer, Walesa had openly declared ``war at the top.''
His backers and Mazowiecki's began forming new parties. Solidarity
effectively split up.
   Workers and farmers tended to stay with their blue-collar
champion, Walesa, and the Solidarity union itself has been a
powerful engine in his energetic presidential campaign.
   Government officials, professionals, the more educated and more
affluent - including nearly all of Walesa's former intellectual
advisers - sided with Mazowiecki.
   Behind the bitter personal conflict are differing concepts of
democratic leadership in a country where the term, after a half
century of Nazi or Communist rule, is still hazy.
   Walesa says Poland needs a leader with ``an ax,'' ready and
determined to chop out vestiges of the old system and intervene
when he sees injustice. He says he can be a powerful cheerleader
for change.
   But Mazowiecki says he fears such a ``charismatic leader ...
accountable to no one.'' He wants the president to be a guarantor
of stability.
   Also at stake is the government's yearlong shock economic reform
program that has restored stability to the Polish market and
quenched hyperinflation.
   But the plan also cut Poles' real income by 35 percent, brought
on a deep recession and created 1 million unemployed.
   Walesa says he supports the tough plan and its architect, Deputy
Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, who might even be offered the
premiership if the Solidarity chief wins. However Walesa wants
faster privatization and more government support to give private
enterprise a jump start.
   Mazowiecki responds that his privatization timetable is the
fastest possible for selling half 7,000 state enterprises within
three years.
   He says the election of Walesa could upset Poland as it is
rounding a dangerous curve, threatening all the hard-won domestic
and international achievements of the past year and slowing down
the country's integration with the rest of Europe.
   If defeated, Mazowiecki says he will resign as prime minister
and move into political opposition.
   Walesa has said if defeated he will quit as Solidarity chairman
and retire until the Polish nation needs him again. But he does not
expect to lose.
   ``I was born only for victory,'' he declared in an interview.

   Avon is calling, Chinese-style.
   Instead of knocking on doors in the American tradition to sell
beauty supplies, Avon salespeople in China will use the
time-hallowed Chinese custom of working through personal contacts.
   The first selling job Avon faced in China was with Chinese
officials, said John Novosad, vice president for the Asia-Pacific
region of Avon Products Inc.
   ``The first thing we heard was, `What's direct selling?'''
Novosad said Wednesday in a telephone interview from his Hong Kong
office. ``They had great difficulty understanding why we thought
this was a good idea.''
   Avon in a joint venture with the Guangzhou Cosmetics Factory
began selling beauty products this month in the southern city of
Guangzhou, also known as Canton. The company has 25 supervisors,
all Chinese, who have recruited about 800 people to sell beauty
supplies on a commission basis, Novosad said.
   ``We expected to have to spend a lot of time teaching these
people about profit incentive and the selling methods,'' Novosad
said. ``You're talking about a country that we all believe doesn't
know about these things. Well, it wasn't that way. The first
question we heard was, `How much commission do I get?'''
   Avon, which already sells its products in more than 100
countries, is selling skin-care supplies, perfumes, cosmetics and
personal hygiene items in China. They will be made in China with
imported ingredients.
   The company's traditional image in the United States is of an
``Avon lady'' ringing doorbells and spending leisurely afternoons
with her customers.
   ``Here, we're telling the representatives to build networks,
talk to their sisters, talk to those they work with and so on.
There are no limits, so it can be done door-to-door if they feel
comfortable, or it can be done by taking brochures to work. It
depends on the ingenuity.''
   Novosad said Avon will test the method in Guangzhou before
trying other parts of China, which has a population of about 1.1
billion people.
   Avon supervisors receive a base salary, but also get a 2 percent
to 6 percent commission on the sales of the representatives they
recruit, Novosad said. The salespeople will receive a 25 percent
commission on their sales, he said.
   ``We think it will work here and let us develop a base for all
of China. China, once it gets economically going, will be a
fabulous market of tremendous proportions,'' Novosad said. ``We
don't expect to make millions at first.''
   Prices for Avon products sold in Guangzhou average about $3.
That's one-tenth the average monthly income of a Chinese worker,
but Guangzhou workers are generally better off than those elsewhere
in the country. Customers are most likely to be single young women,
who tend to have relatively high disposable incomes.

<HEAD>Couple's Indian Artifacts Fool Even Some Collectors</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Costner strove for authenticity in
his film ``Dances With Wolves,'' shot with many Indian actors on
the South Dakota prairie, but for some things he went to a couple
in southern Illinois.
   Bill and Kathy Brewer's reproductions of American Indian
artifacts, good enough to fool serious collectors, won them a place
on the movie's closing credits.
   ``It started out as a $15,000 order for weapons,'' Ms. Brewer
said.
   But once the film's producers saw the Brewers' work, they
ordered more and more. The couple said they ended up making more
than 200 props for the film, and billed the movie makers $37,000.
   ``They sent us a script and then the set director called and
said, `What does the inside of a medicine man's teepee look like?'
And then a chief's teepee. They ordered everything Bill drew,'' Ms.
Brewer said.
   Ordinarily they use authentic materials, such as horns purchased
from buffalo ranchers. But they were pressed for time on the movie
and only one of the eight buffalo-horn headdresses they made is
made of real horn, she said Thursday. The other seven are painted
plastic.
   So convincing are their products that collectors of Indian
artifacts are learning to ask ``Is it real or is it a Brewer?''
before plunking down thousands of dollars.
   The Brewers urge prospective buyers to look closely for their
``BKB'' mark on pieces offered by dealers or at auctions. They say
they are starting to get a bad name for making reproductions that
are too good.
   ``We were chewed out at a recent auction in Santa Fe by some
dealers,'' Ms. Brewer recalled. ``They said we had no business
making stuff as good as we do.''
   What started as Brewer's boyhood hobby has become a cottage
industry for the couple, who work out of their modest one-story
house in this small community about 40 miles east of St. Louis.
   Ms. Brewer, 36, said they get details for their works mainly
from genuine artifacts in museums, and that her 37-year-old husband
also has built up an extensive collection of books and journals.
   In addition to ``Dances With Wolves,'' the Brewers said they
produced props for ``Son of the Morning Star,'' a television
miniseries about the private life of George Armstrong Custer. It
stars Gary Cole and Rosanna Arquette and is scheduled for broadcast
in February.
   Demand and prices for Indian artifacts have soared in the past
year since a Navajo chief's blanket fetched $500,000 at an auction
house in New York.
   But some collectors have gotten burned by buying items
advertised as authentic that turn out to be Brewer originals.
   ``We made a painted Apache gun case that ended up at
Sotheby's,'' Ms. Brewer said. ``It got sold - $7,000 - because we
didn't get the (auction) catalog until later.''
   The Brewers wrote to Sotheby's about the mistake and enclosed a
photograph of the piece in progress, she said.
   ``They had to give the lady her money back,'' Ms. Brewer said.
``She called us, and we made her a case just like it for $250.
Because some of the prices are so high, they're creating a market
for reproductions.''

   A new generation of readers will be able to
relish Will Rogers' wit under newly signed agreements to republish
some of the Oklahoman's works.
   ``Will Rogers wrote some 2 million words. We think it's a major
achievement with Oklahoma and the world that wants to know more
about this guy,'' said Joe Carter, director of the Will Rogers
Memorial honoring the humorist who died in 1935.
   Officials of the University of Oklahoma Press and the Will
Rogers Memorial signed contracts Wednesday for two separate works
of Rogers' writings from the 1920s and 1930s, Carter said.
   Under the first contract, the Press will publish a manuscript
entitled ``The Cowboy Philosopher: A Will Rogers Anthology.''
Carter said the work will include Rogers' early works on
Prohibition and politics.
   William Savage Jr., a University of Oklahoma history professor,
will work with the memorial to edit and produce the anthology,
Carter said.
   The second contract is for a new two-volume edition of Rogers
writings. Carter said a $158,800 grant from the Sarkeys Foundation
in Norman will subsidize printing that work. The first volume is
set for 1992 and the second for 1993.
   ``We're now having a national search for an editor, a scholarly
type editor,'' Carter said.
   ``This will be the complete, collective writings of Will
Rogers,'' he said. ``It will be sold worldwide.''
   Carter said the republished works will be coming out at just the
right time. Recently, 20th Century Fox announced it is re-releasing
50 Will Rogers' movies. A new Broadway play also is on the horizon,
titled ``Ziegfeld Presents Will Rogers.''

<HEAD>Army May Halt Discharges at US Bases to Assure Gulf Troop Strength</HEAD>

   Thousands of soldiers could be forced to stay
in the Army under a policy change being considered as a way to beef
up potential troop reinforcements for the Persian Gulf.
   The Army has been studying changes in its so-called ``stop
loss'' rules governing what officers and enlisted personnel may be
kept on in the service, even if they are ready to retire or their
enlistment has expired and they don't want to sign up again.
   ``There are policy changes under consideration,'' Army
spokeswoman Judy Johnston said Thursday.
   And one Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said an announcement on the subject was being prepared.
   Since August, under President Bush's order sending troops to
Saudi Arabia, the armed services have had authority to retain
people on duty in the gulf who reach their retirement or
re-enlistment dates.
   Capt. Barbara Goodno, an Army public affairs officer working on
the issue, said that in the Army, this also has applied to some
specialists in support units in the United States.
   Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner, a Defense Department spokesman, said the
Army had been working on a ``conceptual plan'' regarding this
authority that he understood would ``expand it to include virtually
everyone.''
   Each year, 10 percent of the Army corps of approximately 105,000
officers and 20 percent of the more than 625,000 enlisted men reach
voluntary retirement.
   The New York Times, quoting officials whom it did not identify,
said in Thursday's editions that the Army had decided to halt about
1,500 retirements and enlistment expirations a month.
   The Washington Post, also quoting unnamed sources, said the
policy change was expected to take effect Dec. 1.
   Ms. Johnston said the changes being considered also would trim
vacations for trainees. Depending on the final decision, she said,
such vacations could be reduced in length or eliminated.
   Officials quoted by the Post said the policy change also would
put an end to transfers unrelated to the situation in the gulf.
   Wagner said he did not know whether the other services were
contemplating similar action.
   An estimated 120,000 Army troops are now deployed in Saudi
Arabia. Earlier this week, the Army called 20,129 more reservists
to active duty.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has authorized activation of up to
125,000 reservists from all services.
   Bush announced recently he was doubling U.S. troop strength in
the gulf region to about 400,000 so that the forces there could be
ready to go on the offensive if necessary.

<HEAD>U.S. Big Agriculture Importer - Even Feathers and Castor Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Besides being a huge exporter of agricultural
products, the United States also is one of the biggest importers.
Even castor oil and feathers are on the list, says the Agriculture
Department.
   Total commodity exports in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30
were at a nine-year high of $40.2 billion. Department analysts say
exports may be down a bit, but don't bet that imports will follow
suit.
   Imports in the 1990 fiscal year were at a record $22.5 billion,
according to a report by Stephen R. Milmoe of the department's
Economic Research Service. That was up $1 billion from the previous
high set in 1989.
   As a result, that squeezed the U.S. agricultural trade surplus -
the difference in value between exports and imports - to $17.7
billion, compared with $18.2 billion the previous year.
   Back in 1972, when U.S. farm exports were loafing along at $8.2
billion, the import value that year was $5.9 billion. The
agricultural trade surplus was $2.3 billion.
   Exports took off after that, rising to a record $43.8 billion in
1981 before turning down during most of the 1980s. In those heady
years of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the farm trade surplus
steamed along at more than $20 billion a year.
   In the year that ended on Sept. 30, some of the big-ticket
import items included $2.85 billion worth of meat and meat
products, nearly $2 billion worth of coffee, $1.2 billion worth of
fresh or frozen vegetables, $925 million worth of bananas, $921
million worth of wine, and $588 million worth of tobacco.
   Not to mention 12,000 metric tons of feathers and down valued at
$69.8 million. The 39,000 tons of castor oil was worth $36.3
million.
   Essential oils that smell good, fresh mangoes, pistachio nuts,
tea, chestnuts, nursery stock, sesame seed, palm oil, canned
mushrooms and hops were among the import items.
   Farm exports were largely concentrated in the value of huge bulk
items such as grains and feed worth $15.7 billion; animals and
animal products, $6.55 billion; soybeans and other oilseeds and
products, $6.1 billion; cotton, $2.7 billion; vegetables and their
products, $2.08 billion; fruits and various preparations, $1.86
billion; and tobacco, $1.37 billion.
   Within those categories were some items just as exotic as those
on the import side.
   For example, last year's U.S. exports included 55,000 tons of
horsemeat valued at $147.5 million; 39.7 million baby chicks, $80.3
million; 5.1 million mink pelts, $115.7 million; and 49,000 tons of
lard.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A rise in the use of feed grains to fatten
livestock is being more than offset in an expected decline in
exports, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Overall, the total supply of feed grains - corn, sorghum, oats
and barley - is forecast at 276.9 million metric tons in the
1990-91 marketing year, down 11.5 million tons from 1989-90.
Production rose but not enough to offset a drop in inventories at
the beginning of the year.
   Total U.S. use of feed grain is expected to decline 5 million
tons from 242 million tons in 1989-90 as a result of the export
decrease, the report said. Even so, total use is forecast to exceed
production, meaning a drop in feed grain inventories at the end of
the 1990-91 season.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.5 bushels
of corn. It is the favored unit in measuring total feed grain
supplies.
   ``World production of coarse grains (such as corn and sorghum)
is forecast to rise 2.5 percent in 1990-91 to 820 million tons, the
highest in four years,'' the report said. ``Foreign production is
expected to advance 2 percent to a record 590 million tons, with
the Soviet Union and China accounting for much of the gains.''
   Global feed grain use was put at 825 million tons, indicating
some draw-down in world inventories during the year. Foreign use is
expected to fall slightly for the first time in five years.
   ``The most significant declines are expected in Europe, where
corn production is down significantly,'' the report said.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - With some exceptions, pastures and livestock
across the nation were reported in ``mostly fair to good''
condition as of mid-November, according to a government report.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility - an operation of the
Agriculture and Commerce departments - said in this week's review
that pastures in California, North Dakota and Utah were in ``mostly
poor'' shape.
   Water for livestock in the southern two-thirds of California was
said to be in short supply.

   The off-again, on-again attitude of the Soviet
Union on using force to liberate Kuwait is a problem for the Bush
administration. Moscow's support is vital, and November is drawing
to a close.
   The significance of the calendar is that the United States is
president of the United Nations Security Council this month. Then
it's Yemen's turn, and the Arab nation has opposed most of the
resolutions aimed at Iraq since the August invasion.
   Running the Security Council gives the Bush administration a
tactical advantage. Once Yemen is in the chair it would be that
much tougher to win adoption of a resolution to use force as a last
resort to liberate Kuwait.
   ``There's a lot of ways to get thoroughly wrapped around the
axle of the United Nations,'' a senior State Department official
said recently about the intricacies of the world organization.
``There are a whole host of other things that can come up. So it's
important to try and do it during the period of our presidency of
the council.''
   Which explains why Secretary of State James A. Baker III decided
to go to Yemen this week.
   But Yemen's president, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, rebuffed Baker's
efforts Thursday to win his country's support for a resolution
authorizing the use of force. Saleh criticized the military buildup
in the region and called for an Arab solution to the crisis.
   ``We knew it was going to be a very tough nut,'' said a State
Department official who demanded anonymity.
   The need for Soviet support has been the case from the outset.
   Bush administration policy makers consider themselves fortunate
that the Cold War thawed before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
decided to annex his smaller, oil-rich neighbor.
   The Soviets are more inclined than the United States to stress
seeking a peaceful resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis. And yet,
they have gone along with the Bush administration on all
resolutions so far.
   Even at the Paris summit, when President Bush failed to get
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concurrence on using force,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was able to report the two
leaders had ``reaffirmed their unity and commitment'' to have Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Now the question is whether the Bush administration's
determination to threaten Saddam with the prospect of an attack can
be meshed with the Soviets' desire to give diplomacy more time to
work.
   And the Soviets are not alone in that view. Several nations in
the makeshift alliance against Iraq agree with Moscow, and so do
many members of Congress.
   Whether Bush would actually pull the trigger and go to war over
Kuwait is anyone's guess at this point. But there is no question
that disagreement within the alliance on the issue would strengthen
Saddam's hand.
   The Soviets, of course, have the power to block a resolution
with a veto. While no one expects such a situation to arise, the
Bush administration wants to be sure of more than cautious support
from Moscow on using force.
   And Soviet leaders have been cautious and ambiguous.
   Asked in Paris on Monday if he thought ``force or patience''
would resolve the crisis, Gorbachev ducked. ``Well, I think we all
need patience,'' he said. ``But that does not mean we are going to
weaken, that we are going to retreat. No, we are going forward in a
very resolute way.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was equally
cautious - and imprecise - when he was asked in Moscow earlier in
the month if Baker had convinced him that force might be necessary
as a last resort.
   ``Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out - probably
this could not be ruled out - and a situation may emerge which
effectively would require such a move,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Only a few hours earlier, the Soviet foreign minister called the
use of force ``undesirable.''
   So with the clock ticking, and Saddam watching, the Bush
administration hopes to cobble together a resolution Moscow can
support - and get it passed before the end of November.

   Ads with sexy bronzed models should be
required to carry health warnings that tanning can cause skin
cancer, medical specialists said today.
   The advertising, fashion and marketing industries are
irresponsibly promoting tans, counteracting efforts to encourage
Australians to reduce their skin-cancer risk, the Australasian
College of Dermatologists said.
   ``I believe that each of these pictures should in fact carry a
warning, similar to those found on cigarette packets: suntanning is
a cancer hazard,'' Dr. Alan Cooper, the college's honorary
secretary, told a news conference.
   ``When I see parents with very young babies on beaches with no
protection, I think that is child abuse,'' he added.
   Cooper called for a concerted effort to promote the image that
``the pale Australian is in, and the bronzed Aussie is out.''
   Tell that to fans of Crocodile Dundee.

   Actor Dennis Quaid is back in Hollywood after
taking off a year to travel, get engaged and get clean.
   ``I guess I'm straight all the time. Rather than checking out of
the world, I check into the world,'' Quaid says in the Dec. 10
issue of US magazine.
   ``I'm much crazier than I thought. It's all about how you go
through life.''
   Of his battle with drugs and alcohol, he says: ``You have a very
hard, fast-paced life, and there's a lot of tension and pressure.
And, at the end of the day, you find another way to deal with it.
Which is to check out with drugs and booze.''
   While moviegoers earlier this year saw him in ``Postcards from
the Edge,'' Quaid was traveling in Europe and got engaged to
actress Meg Ryan.
   Quaid says his next film, ``Come See the Paradise,'' a movie
about the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II,
tells an important story. But he doesn't expect it will be a
box-office smash.
   ``Certainly everyone would like to do movies that make all the
money, but I can't make that my consideration in choosing a role,''
he said.

   PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) - Peace activist Dick Gregory began a fast
to protest military action in the Persian Gulf and said he'd
maintain it until all U.S. troops are returned home.
   Gregory began the fast Thanksgiving morning with a prayer vigil
at Plymouth Rock.
   ``Thanksgiving is the day that we in America set aside to be
thankful for the abundance of our land,'' Gregory said. ``It is
hard to be completely thankful with war in the Persian Gulf casting
a shadow across our country.''
   Gregory was a civil rights activist in the 1960s and marched
with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X. The one-time stand-up
comic is now considered a diet guru, for a liquid diet plan he
created.
   President Bush recently ordered U.S. troop strength in Saudi
Arabia doubled to about 400,000. The troops are part of a
multinational force to contain possible aggression by Iraq, which
invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) - Country star Tammy Wynette will
perform a free Christmas concert Dec. 19 for soldiers, reservists
and family members at Fort Campbell.
   ``This is her special tribute to the soldiers and family members
of Operation Desert Shield,'' post spokesman Bill Harralson said
Thursday.
   The entire 101st Airborne Division, about 19,000 soldiers, began
deploying to Saudi Arabia in August. About 3,500 soldiers remain at
the post and some reservists also are stationed there.

   GUADALUPE, Spain (AP) - King Juan Carlos marked the 15th
anniversary of his coronation with a visit to the Guadalupe
monastery where his ancestors agreed to finance Columbus' voyage
into the unknown.
   It was a fitting place to commemorate the start 15 years ago
Thursday of his reign, which at first appeared such an unsure
proposition that the head of the Communist Party nicknamed him Juan
Carlos ``The Brief.''
   Juan Carlos took over the government two days after the death of
Gen. Francisco Franco, dictator for nearly four decades. But Franco
miscalculated when he chose Juan Carlos to prolong his regime.
   The young monarch promptly presided over major democratic
reforms, including the legalization of political parties and trade
unions. Within two years, Spaniards had voted in their first free
elections since 1936. By 1978, they adopted a constitution.
   His staunch backing of the constitutional government during a
February 1981 military coup attempt helped foil the plot.
   In recent years, Juan Carlos, now 52, has kept a low political
profile. But he continues to draw praise as a goodwill ambassador,
along with Queen Sofia, easing Spain's entry into the European
mainstream under a Socialist government.

<HEAD>Alaskan Villagers Weep as Search for Independent 80-Year-Old is
Called Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Villagers wept when the search for an
independent 80-year-old man, who hunted and trapped his own food,
was called off.
   Milton R. Trump, a towering, white-haired, white-bearded man,
likely became lost or disabled in the snow while trying to hike
into town when his snowmobile wouldn't go any farther, officials
said.
   Alaska State Troopers called off the rescue effort this week
after three days of fruitless searching.
   ``It doesn't look real good, unless he made it to a cabin,''
said Trump's 27-year-old son, Jim.
   The weather was mild Nov. 16, the last day Trump's daughter
talked with him by radio. But a snowstorm dumped 8 inches of snow
the following day, obscuring any tracks. More snow fell Monday,
leaving a 1-foot accumulation on the ground.
   Trump's snowmobile was found parked along the Talkeetna River
outside of this town about 75 miles north of Anchorage.
   Searchers speculated Trump abandoned the machine and tried to
walk to town when it would go no further in the sparse snow cover.
   ``He had walked out before,'' said neighbor ``Trapper'' George
Sanderlin, 58. ``He was a tough old son of a gun.''
   Troopers flying over area cabins saw no signs of Trump. Family
members and neighbors feared he might have fallen into the river.
   Trump lived in a cabin seven miles outside of town that he built
himself 10 years ago, chopping his his own wood, and hunting and
trapping his own food.
   ``He was a crusty old soul with a heart of gold,'' said Pam
Rannals, who works at the Talkeetna Roadhouse.
   ``He acted like he was 35 years old,'' bush pilot Doug Getting
said. ``He was always like a big kid.''
   Many of Talkeetna's 600 residents showed up in September to help
Trump celebrate his 80th birthday with a party featuring an exotic
dancer.
   Trump, a retired mailman from Cleveland, also was a popular
photographic subject with tourists, whom he charged for the
privilege.
   A color spread from a Japanese magazine showing Trump in a
stream holding a king salmon hangs on the wall of the lodge where
his daughter, Nancy, works. He also posed in long underwear on Mt.
McKinley for a foreign commercial.
   ``He was such a good looking Alaskan, you'd have thought he'd
been here forever,'' Rannals said.
   In fact, Trump moved to Alaska with his three children in 1970
after retiring from his postal job.

   The government is cracking down on
uncleanliness, ordering people who litter to undergo counseling and
fining people who don't flush after using public toilets.
   A fine of $17 (U.S.) will be introduced from Dec. 1 for those
who neglect to flush, the Environment Ministry said. Incorribile
non-flushers may have to pay as much as $588 for three or more
offenses.
   The ministry said littering was getting worse despite fines of
up to $588.
   Counseling for litterers is to consist of a 15-minute pep talk
in which the culprit will be told how such an antisocial act can
harm the environment.
   The authorities have mounted regular drives since 1968 to raise
civic consciousness to keep Singapore clean. What was once one of
the filthiest cities in Southeast Asia is now spotless by
comparison with most municipalities.

<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families who missed their soldier kin
during Thanksgiving dinner in Fort Campbell mess halls expect
Christmas will be even lonelier.
   Lorraine Gould said her husband, Staff Sgt. Henry Gould, never
missed a birthday, Thanksgiving or Christmas with his family during
14 years in the Army until he was sent to the Persian Gulf.
   Instead of sharing turkey dinner with their husband and father
on Thursday, Mrs. Gould and her three children sat down with 3,000
other family members and friends of soldiers.
   ``We've already mailed Christmas presents to Saudi Arabia,''
Mrs. Gould said. ``It's hard for the kids to understand because he
was always here for the holidays.''
   Her oldest, Jason, celebrated his eighth birthday the day
before. He was given a set of encyclopedias, and the first thing he
did was look up Saudi Arabia, to find out where his father was.
   ``There was a map and Saudi Arabia was just a little shape,'' he
said. ``It's real far away.''
   Jason said he understood why his father was away. ``It's because
of Saddam Hussein. He's stealing oil to make lots of money. He
stole Kuwait and he has to give it back.''
   The relatives and friends who crowded into four mess halls at
Fort Campbell paid $2.45 for a meal almost identical to the one
soldiers ate in the desert.
   ``This way everyone can gather around and meet other people that
have husbands in the Persian Gulf. It helps them feel less alone,''
said cook foreman Sam Tugadi, who began decorating cakes and
preparing 144 pounds of boneless turkey two days earlier.
   A similar meal is planned for Christmas.
   The dinner started with shrimp cocktail and ended with a choice
of 12 types of pie. In between there were turkey and dressing, ham,
and cornish hen. Fruits and nuts and cakes were spread across long
tables.
   The four mess halls hummed and clattered with activity, but the
rest of the post was nearly deserted. The entire 101st Airborne
Division, about 19,000 soldiers, went sent to the Middle East in
August and September.
   About 3,500 soldiers still remain at the post on the
Tennessee-Kentucky line, post officials said.
   Lynn Quinlan, 41, said she came to the mess hall to spend
Thanksgiving with other Army wives while her husband, Lt. Col.
Kenneth Quinlan, was in the desert.
   ``The unit's support is every bit as wonderful as my family at
home,'' she said. ``This is also my family here.''
   Meggin Garrett, 18, said she couldn't imagine Christmas without
her father, Col. Thomas Garrett, dressed in his Santa Claus suit,
entertaining the children at a giant family get-together.
   ``He's only been away one time at Christmas, when he was in
Vietnam,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two schooners on the National Register
of Historic Places will not be moved from their muddy moorings to
make way for a new marina. But some fear the sailing ships will
allowed to crumble into the river.
   Abandoned, rotting and moss-covered, the two schooners that have
been mired in the water at the edge of this coastal town for nearly
six decades were targeted for removal as part of an effort to
rebuild the area.
   ``If they touch the schooners they'll be dead,'' First Selectman
Lawrence Gordon said after the board Tuesday scuttled the plan to
move the ships from where they've been since 1932.
   Gordon said the selectmen would never let the town Waterfront
Committee's recommendation come up for a vote at a town meeting.
   The committee worked for more than a year on a five-year plan
for the banks of the Sheepscot River, where the venerable Luther
Little and Hesper schooners are visible to thousands of tourists
who drive by on U.S. Route 1.
   The panel's first priority was to remove the ships to make room
for a marina, a waterfront walkway and possibly a dock for cruise
ships or windjammers. The committee hoped the ships would be
preserved in Maine's maritime museums.
   Now, Waterfront Committee Chairman Daniel Thompson worries that
the last four-masted, World War I-era coal schooners on the East
Coast will left to decay and rot in the river.
   But Selectman Benjamin Rines Jr. said he was offended that
anyone would consider taking the schooners out of the river.
   ``Those ships are part of a family and you just don't put them
in a museum,'' said Rines. The ships are on the National Register
of Historic Places and are part of the town's historic district.
   Wiscasset, a town of 3,800 about 35 miles northeast of Portland,
has been home to the Luther Little and the Hesper since they were
towed up the Sheepscot River by Frank W. Winter, who wanted to use
them to haul lumber from a northern Maine mill to Boston and New
York.
   But the scheme fell victim to the Great Depression and Winter's
death. Trains that were to carry the lumber never rolled and the
ships were never removed.
   The Luther Little, which was launched in 1917, and the Hesper,
which was launched in 1918, have been ravaged by fires and nature
over the years.
   The Hesper has lost its masts, and trees have sprouted through
holes in its hull. The Luther Little still has its masts, but parts
of its hull have rotted away.

   Polish presidential candidate Lech Walesa
was quoted today as saying he expects new unrest in his homeland.
   In an interview in Die Welt, a respected Bonn newspaper, the
Solidarity leader predicted a ``big struggle'' because ``our
reforms are not making progress.
   ``There are still no private owners,'' he was quoted as saying.
``The majority of businesses are still in state hands.''
   On Sunday Walesa challenges Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
former friend and ally, in Poland's first popular presidential
election. The country shed its four-decade-old communist government
in August last year.
   Walesa has demanded quicker privatization of the economy, while
Mazowiecki has taken a slower approach which he says must be based
on law.
   Walesa told the newspaper he considered it ``unlikely'' that he
would lose the election, and public opinion polls have him in the
lead.
   ``But it is always possible,'' he said. ``Winston Churchill won
the war, but then lost the election.''

   American teen-agers in Germany have
launched a ``cover-up'' mission for Persian Gulf soldiers yearning
for reading material.
   Using marking pens and an eye for what may offend Saudi
sensibilities, the teens have been drawing over pictures of
scantily clad people and advertisements for alcohol and tobacco
products.
   ``The original plan was that they were just going to cut out the
pictures, but after the first three magazines they had edited out,
there was nothing left,'' said U.S. Air Force 2nd Lt. Bryan
Stokstad, who organized the magazine drive.
   Stokstad, of Des Moines, Iowa, said he got the idea after
reading an article in the unofficial military newspaper Stars and
Stripes ``that the morale down there was just a little bit low''
because troops didn't have enough current publications.
   ``They were receiving the Stars and Stripes, but they were
getting issues a week late, and just for them to circulate around
it would take even longer,'' Stockstad said Thursday.
   He said the project was started in mid-October, and as of last
week the volunteers had sent out 2,500 pounds of magazines to Saudi
Arabia through the military postal system.
   ``We have about 750 pounds of magazines that are left and ready
to go out, and I'm hoping we'll be able to send them off soon,''
said Stokstad, who works in the command post of Sembach Air Base
near Kaiserslautern, about 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   At first, he said he set up collection points at the base
recreation center, the shopping center and the chapel at the air
base, asking for donations of current news magazines.
   Then he contacted a base teenage group called LIFE, which stands
for Life is for Everyone, to ask for help in editing pictures that
the Saudis might find offensive. The nearly 20 youths in the group
range in age of 12 to 18.
   He said that one of the teen-age girls came up with the idea of
drawing clothes on the pictures.
   ``That way if there was an article on the back of a page it
wouldn't be disturbed,'' said Stokstad. ``It kind of took over from
there, and basically that's what we're doing. Drawing clothes and
covering things up with markers.''
   ``There was a lady that was in an advertisment for brassieres,
and one of the girls drew a blouse on her. It looked real good,''
he added. ``We've also been covering up anything associated with
alcohol and tobacco.''
   The magazines sent include Time, People, U.S. News and World
Report, and sports and car magazines, Stokstad said.
   ``It's amazing the amount of magazines we have received,''
Stokstad said. ``Magazines are expensive. One box that came in had
a collection of 40 to 50 National Geographics all in perfect
condition.''

<DATELINE>BABYLON, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief archaeologist was picking dates
from a tree to kill time and ease her boredom in the legendary
gardens of Babylon, where Saddam Hussein wants to rebuild one of
the wonders of the ancient world.
   Shafeka Mohammed Jaafar has no work because Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait stalled efforts to restore the glory of Babylon, whose kings
ruled an empire that stretched over most of the Middle East.
   Saddam, the self-styled ``Knight of the Arab nation,'' fancies
himself a modern-day Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's most famous king.
   Iraqi laborers, many of them military reservists, have been
called up to bolster Saddam's army facing more than 330,000
multinational troops massed in the deserts of Saudi Arabia.
   Also, thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian laborers fled Babylon
after the Aug. 2 invasion.
   An estimated $100 million was spent on the project over the last
decade. But funds have became scarce as Saddam juggles a cash
squeeze brought on by the U.N.-supported embargo on Iraqi trade and
oil exports.
   A lone soldier with an AK-47 rifle now stands guard at the
entrance to Nebuchadnezzar's partially rebuilt Babylon.
   ``Before, our president used to visit us regularly, but after he
liberated Kuwait, he has not come even once,'' said Mrs. Jaafar,
47.
   ``He's very busy now fighting Zionist and imperialist forces,''
she added, nibbling at her freshly collected dates.
   More than 2,500 years ago, Babylon rose in the land of
Mesopotamia on the Euphrates River.
   Under Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon entered its golden age. Its
Hanging Gardens, one of the so-called ``seven wonders of the
world,'' long ago crumbled to dust. An artificial lake has been dug
to irrigate the future gardens.
   For 1,200 years, the Babylonians ruled an empire that flourished
as a cultural, religious and commercial center. According to some
traditions, the Garden of Eden in the Bible was in this land
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
   Under Saddam, a new Babylon has begun to rise again.
   An estimated 15 million bricks, baked as they were centuries
ago, have been used to rebuild the city's monuments. The plans are
based on archaeological evidence, cuneiform texts of Babylonian
characters and descriptions from ancient historians.
   Every 100th brick bears the name of Saddam in Arabic proclaiming
the Iraqi leader's efforts to reconstruct Babylon.
   To Saddam and many Iraqi officials, restoring Babylon is more
than an archaeological venture.
   ``After centuries we've got Saddam, a great leader who's going
to restore the past glory of our land. It's only Saddam who can do
that,'' Mrs. Jaafar said as she guided reporters through the ruins
of the 8-square-mile city.
   Iraqis are constantly told that Saddam can restore the lost
glory of Babylon. The state-owned news media and dozens of books
stress that Babylon once controlled the land that is now Iraq,
Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait and Israel.
   Reminders of Saddam are everywhere in Babylon, as they are in
the rest of Iraq.
   On the 55-mile journey from Baghdad south to Babylon, past oil
refineries and anti-aircraft batteries, Saddam's portraits appear
on almost every building, at gasoline stations and fruit stands.
   The road to Babylon branches off the highway before the town of
Hilla. At the entrance to modern Babylon, a small town of one-story
houses, stands a huge portrait of Saddam wearing an Arab keffiyeh
headdress with a white dove of peace fluttering over his head.
   ``Saddam is no ordinary leader and no ordinary president,'' said
Mrs. Jaafar. ``He is the new Nebuchadnezzar.''
   Portraits of Saddam and Nebuchadnezzar are displayed
side-by-side in Babylon and Baghdad.
   In the souvenir shop at Babylon, pamphlets and books carry
portraits of Saddam after the title page. Nebuchadnezzar is hailed
for his dual role as a civilian and military leader.
   The same image is projected in Baghdad in portraits showing
Saddam in fatigues or in Western suits.
   The Iraqi media refers to Saddam as ``father-leader,'' ``hero of
national liberation'' and ``standard-bearer of Islam.''
   Nebuchadnezzar is projected to Iraqis as the defender of the
``Arab nation,'' even though he lived 1,000 years before there was
such a concept.
   Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, took the people of Israel
into captivity for 50 years and fought for years against the
Persians - not unlike Saddam's 1980-88 war with Iran, the
modern-day Persia.
   Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 B.C., 24 years before the city was
captured by the Persians.

<HEAD>Cranberries in Short Supply Over Holiday season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canned cranberry sauce was a common item on
Thanksgiving dinner tables because a weather-damaged crop left
growers with few fresh berries to sell this year.
   ``Fresh cranberries? Forget it. The fat lady sang two weeks
ago,'' said John C. Decas, an owner of Decas Bros. in Wareham, a
major cranberry grower and marketer.
   The crop of sour berries dropped 30 percent statewide from last
year's harvest. Wholesalers usually sell berries to retailers up to
a few days before Christmas, but this year they began rationing
sales for the Thanksgiving holiday and ran out altogether earlier
this month.
   The cranberry shortage was caused by inclement weather. The
December 1989 deep freeze damaged some vines, and an 8-inch,
bog-flooding rainfall on Cape Cod and adjacent areas in late July
was devastating, leading to rot.
   Massachusetts traditionally is the nation's biggest cranberry
grower, accounting for half the U.S. crop. Wisconsin might take
over the top spot this year once this year's figures are in. It had
only a slightly below-average crop.
   Not surprisingly, the shortage has brought higher prices.
   ``I saw our berries on sale at a local store at $1.59 for a
12-ounce pack - amazing,'' Decas said. Last year the price was in
the 89 cents to $1.09 range. Retailers are getting more out of the
shortage than those who raise the berries, he said.
   ``Growers got a much more modest 10 percent price increase for
their berries,'' Decas said.

   Gone are the days of spinning tops and
building blocks. Nowadays, children favor noisy, action-packed toys
and games, and have an uncanny knack for choosing the most
expensive, a survey found.
   Topping the list of favorites were an electronic bowling alley
costing $140 and a $50 fire engine with realistic horn and siren
sounds, the Third Annual Duracell National Toy Survey found.
   Nearly 600 children between the ages of 5 and 9 recently
``play-tested'' 22 toys at their local YMCA after-school programs
for at least one hour per day over 10 consecutive school days.
   Children in 30 programs nationwide voted for their favorites
both on the first and the last day of play. Not all the toys used
in the survey require batteries, the Bethel-based battery giant was
quick to point out.
   But the top three toys chosen by the children do.
   Most popular were top-ranked Power Alley Electronic Bowling by
Marchon, an electronic extravaganza designed to turn a playroom
into a bowling alley, and the Sound Machine Water Cannon fire
engine by Nylint.
   One 6-year-old boy described the appeal of the fire engine
perfectly, saying he liked it ``because it makes a lot of noise,''
the survey said. Another 6-year-old called the bowling game ``fun,
big and automatic.''
   The third most popular toy was Sound FX by Mattel, a wrist
speaker that produces sounds and music when cued by body movements.
   The survey, analyzed by TrendSights, a consumer research and
evaluation company, found a marked difference in the selections of
boys and girls.
   While boys voted in large numbers for the heavy action and
mechanical toys like the top three, girls tended to favor
low-intensity competitive group games and the more intellectually
challenging games, the survey said.
   The fourth and fifth most popular selections - Super Dough Magic
Show, a game in which children perform magic tricks with modeling
clay, and Rattle Me Bones, a hand-eye coordination game in which
players must carefully remove objects from a skeleton without
disturbing it - were heavily favored by girls, the survey said.
   The top 12 list contains one or two variations on longtime
childhood favorites.
   Monopoly Junior by Parker Brothers - a simplified version of the
classic board game, which revolves around life at an amusement park
- was the sixth most popular toy on the list.
   Lights Alive - a high-tech, multicolored version of the
ever-popular sketchboard, in which children can create pictures on
a magic screen that can be easily wiped cleaned - ranked 11th.

   As many overfed Americans try to recover from
their Thanksgiving feasts, Nancy Jamison will nurse her ailing
truck back into the city's poorest neighborhoods today to hand out
food to the needy.
   On Thursday, Jamison pulled her dilapidated yellow truck up to
the Pilgrim Congregational Church in Boston's Dorchester section to
deliver bread, onions and carrots to people who didn't have turkey
for Thanksgiving.
   It was just another day for Jamison. Today, assuming the
temperamental transmission on her truck doesn't seize up entirely,
Jamison will return to the church to hand out surplus food again.
   ``Millions of pounds of food, darlin', are dumped every day
while people are starving,'' she said Thursday. ``Mayonnaise
sandwiches are a reality, my dear.''
   A 40-year-old former fashion designer, Jamison is a one-woman
food program, delivering vegetables and bread to the city's
neediest people. Her ailing truck is always met at the Pilgrim
church by a crowd of hungry people.
   Thursday, a throng of handicapped people, Cape Verdean
immigrants, elderly and homeless filed past her, stuffing paper
bags with food other people deemed unacceptable to sell.
   ``Peace to you sister,'' Jamison said, reaching out to one
elderly woman.
   ``Go on, get a bag,'' she said to a hesitant patron who
whispered she had no money for a donation. ``Ah, it's free today
sister. You go get the old ladies and bring `em out here.''
   ``This helps me,'' said Florence St. Marie, a 67-year-old
retiree who cares for her handicapped son. ``I run short on money.
Without her I wouldn't know what to do.''
   Jamison often wonders why she spends her days traveling Boston's
most poverty-stricken areas, feeding the least fortunate.
   ``I get up every Thanksgiving and curse myself,'' she said. ``I
ask myself, `Am I nuts or what?'''
   Tired of fashion design and frustrated ``seeing all those people
pay 1,200 bucks for coats,'' Jamison turned to community service in
the mid-1970s. She did everything from political organizing to
gathering wood for fuel for the poor.
   Two years ago, upset by the poverty she saw on Boston streets,
Jamison decided to start the group Fair Foods. She and a handful of
volunteers deliver 40,000 pounds of surplus food to 45 churches and
community centers each week.
   Fair Foods relies on the Best Foods bakery chain for much of its
supply. Wholesale produce outlets donate slightly damaged
vegetables.
   Clad in faded jeans and a down vest, graying hair tied in a
ponytail, Jamison describes herself as ``a rich honky.'' She is
frustrated that her ``liberal friends from the 1960s'' won't jump
on the bandwagon - or truck, so to speak.
   ``We have been hiding our poor people very effectively for the
last 10 years, but the depths of their suffering have increased
dramatically,'' she said.

   Folks have been getting the Polasky twins
confused for years. But during this holiday season, they can tell
which is which.
   Tom is the one on duty in the Persian Gulf. Tim is the one left
at home on the family's dairy farm.
   The 20-year-old brothers are separated for the first time in
their lives by half the world and an Army regulation that allows
only one at a time to be sent overseas.
   ``I was glad I didn't have to go, but I wish both of us could
have stayed home,'' says Tim, who wears an Operation Desert Shield
T-shirt.
   Even though he has exclusive use of the car he and his brother
always shared, Tim says it feels strange and lonesome - especially
during the holidays.
   The family's traditional Thanksgiving dinner wasn't the same
without Tom and Jeanne Polasky says her son sounds depressed when
he calls from Saudi Arabia.
   ``There's nothing to do,'' she says. ``They play a lot of cards
and spend half their time sleeping.''
   The twins joined the North Dakota Army National Guard last
winter. The Army kept them together for basic training and boot
camp, and both were assigned to the 132nd Quartermaster Detachment
of Cando, about 60 miles northeast of their farm.
   ``We requested they go together,'' says their mother. ``They
wanted to go together.''
   When their unit was activated Sept. 10, Mrs. Polasky prepared to
say goodbye to both.
   Instead, Tom was put on a bus to Fort McCoy, Wis., and Tim was
transferred to another outfit.
   Mrs. Polasky's first letters to her son said ``See you at
Christmas.'' Now, she counts on him being back for his sister's
wedding in June.
   By then, it could be Tim's turn to ship out.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decline has
been happening slowly for years, but the crisis erupted less than a
month ago in Rome.
   The occasion was a summit meeting for the 12 leaders of the
European Community, which began Oct. 27. Mrs. Thatcher, often at
odds with continental leaders, was again alone in an 11-1 vote in
favor of setting up a European central bank and working toward a
common currency.
   At home, Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey went on a television
interview show and predicted the prime minister would eventually
fall into line. There had been other fights, Howe said, and Mrs.
Thatcher usually came around.
   She returned home saying the other 11 European leaders were
living in ``cloud cuckoo land.''
   On Oct. 30, Mrs. Thatcher was at the center of particularly
rowdy session in the House of Commons, rejecting any thought of
surrendering sovereignty to a European super-state.
   ``No, no, no!,'' she shouted.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, needled Mrs.
Thatcher by inviting her to affirm her support for Howe. She
passed.
   On Nov. 1, Howe resigned.
   That revived talk of a Conservative Party revolt against Mrs.
Thatcher, and inevitably interest turned to Michael Heseltine,
widely regarded as a prime minister in waiting ever since he
resigned from the Cabinet in January 1986.
   As he had so many times before, Heseltine said he could not
foresee the circumstances in which he would stand against Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Wary of a possible challenge, Mrs. Thatcher on Nov. 6 moved up
the annual leadership election, which could have been held as late
as Dec. 5. She moved it to Nov. 20.
   On Nov. 8, the Conservatives suffered a humiliating third-place
finish in a special parliamentary election in Bradford, a district
the Conservatives had won in the early 1980s.
   That reinforced the message of the opinion polls, which for
months had shown Mrs. Thatcher's party trailing the Labor Party.
But the polls also began to show that voters were more favorable
toward the Conservatives with Heseltine as leader.
   The Conservatives, or Tories, were burdened by public
unhappiness over high interest rates, double-digit inflation and
rising unemployment. Above all, Mrs. Thatcher's government had
infuriated legions of voters by replacing the property tax with a
flat tax on every adult, the same rate for millionaires as for
street-sweepers.
   On Nov. 13, Howe delievered a scathing indictment of the prime
minister - a speech as remarkable for its content as for its
author, the long-suffering, soft-spoken last survivor of Mrs.
Thatcher's original Cabinet of 1979.
   The next day, Heseltine said he would challenge Mrs. Thatcher
for leadership of the party and the government.
   Confident of winning, Mrs. Thatcher went ahead with plans to
attend the European security summit in Paris, and that's where she
was Tuesday when she learned that Heseltine had stopped he short
of an outright victory on the first ballot.
   She said she would fight on.
   The next day, she returned to London, consulted with party
leaders and told the nation, ``I fight on. I fight to win.'' But
Cabinet members told her she did not have the votes to win.
   On Thursday morning she decided to resign. Press Association,
the domestic news agency, said Mrs. Thatcher informed aides, who in
turn telephoned Buckingham Palace and notified President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   Hours after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
announced her resignation, she tore into the opposition in
Parliament and gave them a taste of what they have lost.
   ``I'm enjoying this! I'm enjoying this!'' she shouted during one
interruption by opposition Labor Party members.
   And so, it seemed, were the lawmakers who packed the seats and
spilled into the aisles and stairways of the House of Commons.
   ``You can wipe the floor with those people!'' Tory colleague
Toby Jessel shouted in encouragement.
   Conservative lawmakers, including those who voted against her in
the party's leadership battle, were on their feet and waving their
agenda papers as Mrs. Thatcher came in for her regular Thursday
session answering questions.
   Her opponents, at first, paid tribute to a valiant adversary,
defeated but clearly unbowed.
   Though she will still be answering prime minister's questions at
least until Tuesday, this was clearly a last hurrah.
   Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown rose to tell the house
``No one can doubt ... her courage, conviction and the
determination that she has brought to her premiership.''
   ``She amounts to more than those who have turned upon her in
recent days,'' said Neil Kinnock, who had traded innumerable
insults with her in his eight years as leader of the opposition
Labor Party.
   But when the house began debating a motion of no confidence
submitted by Kinnock, the gloves came off.
   ``The government is riddled with distrust, just as the
Conservative Party is racked with disagreement, which cannot be
healed under any leader at any time,'' said Kinnock.
   ``In the present circumstances there really isn't much of a
government in which to have no confidence.''
   ``Windy rhetoric,'' Mrs. Thatcher replied, and several hours
later the governing Conservatives easily defeated Kinnock's motion.
   Mrs. Thatcher's attack was often severe, but there were frequent
moments of laughter.
   Any mirth was lost, however, on Bernard Ingham, the prime
minister's glowering press secretary, who moped in the gallery,
head in hands.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the Conservatives had ``rescued Britain from
the parlous state to which socialism had brought it,'' 11 years
ago.
   ``Once again Britain stands tall in the councils of Europe and
of the world,'' she said. ``We have given back control to people
over their own lives and over their livelihood.''
   Aside from a brief coughing spell, her voice did not waver until
she spoke of Britain's strong response to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``When good has to be upheld, when evil has to be overcome then
Britain will take up arms,'' she said. ``It is because we on this
side (the Conservatives) have never flinched from difficult
decisions that this house and this country can have confidence in
this government today.''
   On Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher ordered an additional 14,000 British
troops to the Persian Gulf, bringing Britain's total to more than
30,000.
   When she sat down, most of the Conservatives stood, shouted and
rattled their papers.
   ``This is the saddest day of my political life,'' said
Conservative member Cranley Onslow, who counted the votes in the
leadership election.
   Fighting to control his emotions, Onslow said Mrs. Thatcher's
achievements ``must not be overlooked in our tears of rage.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush, trying to tighten the Arab
coalition against Iraq, held talks today with Egypt's Hosni Mubarak
after an exhilarating Thanksgiving visit with U.S. combat forces at
remote desert outposts.
   ``We won't pull punches,'' Bush promised troops in Saudi Arabia.
   The Egyptian president put aside his cautious style of
leadership to lead Arab opposition to Iraq after its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. Bush rewarded Mubarak by requesting - and
obtaining - congressional legislation waiving more than $7 billion
in Egyptian military debt to the United States.
   Neither Bush nor Mubarak issued any formal statements today as
they commenced their talks at Kubbah Palace, an ornate guest house
for foreign officials visiting Egypt.
   However, during a picture-taking session, the Egyptian president
said that all peaceful means to end the crisis should be exhausted.
He declined to say when or if force should be used.
   ``Kuwait should be liberated by all means,'' Mubarak told
reporters. ``We will try all the peaceful means. If there is no
other way ... It depends on the Iraqis.''
   Asked how much time Iraq should be given to pull out from the
country it invaded on Aug. 2, Mubarak said: ``We will discuss this
with the (U.S.) president.''
   He said he was pessimistic about a peaceful solution because
Iraq was not willing to compromise.
   ``I am by nature very optimistic but at this time, to a certain
extent, I am very pessimistic,'' Mubarak told a television crew.
Asked whether Egypt was wavering in its anti-Iraqi stance, he
replied, ``There is no change. We are firm.''
   Later, he explained his pessimism, saying ``there is no slight
move from the other side. We have to wait and see.''
   Bush got a red carpet greeting, bands played the two countries'
national anthems and the two leaders posed briefly for pictures
before plunging into discussions about the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Later, Bush was flying to Geneva - his last stop on an eight-day
trip - to confer with Syrian President Hafez Assad, a bitter foe of
Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Bush is the first U.S. president since Jimmy Carter in 1977 to
meet with Assad, whose government has been denounced by the United
States as a supporter of terrorism and oppressor of human rights.
The president said he was seeing Assad simply because of their
common stand against Saddam.
   Bush's difficulty in maintaining an Arab coalition was
underscored Thursday when Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
rebuffed in efforts to get Yemen, the only Arab nation on the
United Nations Security Council, to support a resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraq.
   Yemen's president, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, criticized the
military buildup in the region and called for an Arab solution to
the crisis. Yet, a State Department official said, ``They didn't
say no'' to a new U.N. measure.
   Bush was in high spirits Thursday after hop-scotching by
helicopter across eastern Saudi Arabia to spend Thanksgiving with
troops who someday may be ordered to war to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   The president, accompanied by his wife Barbara, came within 65
miles of the border with Kuwait, stopping at an encampment for U.S.
Marines. Bush called it ``an unforgettable experience.''
   It was a scene of endless desert, marked only by clumps of
camouflage netting that concealed combat vehicles and other
equipment. Altogether, the president saw about 5,000 to 6,000 of
the 230,000 American troops in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We won't pull punches,'' the president promised. ``We are not
here on some exercise. And we're not walking away until our mission
is done, until the invader is out of Kuwait.
   ``And that may well be where you come in,'' he pointedly told
the troops, who responded with hoots of approval.
   The Bushes, joined by the four top congressional leaders, ate
two Thanksgiving dinners with troops at desert outposts and
attended worship services on a ship in the Persian Gulf. Bush also
spoke to a combination of American, British, Saudi and Kuwaiti
troops at an air base in Dhahran.
   ``I think the waiting is a difficult part of this,'' Bush said,
expressing understanding for the troops' anxiety and frustration.
``But I sense a certain resolve on their part. They want to do
something and they want to do it fast, and get it over.''
   ``It was a very emotional day,'' Bush said. ``These are the ones
doing the heavy lifting. God bless them all.''
   Some troops expressed impatience to get home.
   ``Let's go get him (Saddam) now so we can go home,'' Army Spec.
4 Gwendolyn Page shouted at Bush at Dhahran.
   Army Reserves Capt. Don Shiarla, a financial planner from Salem,
Ore., who had to leave his business to serve in the gulf, expressed
frustration that Bush was not rotating reservists and that his
call-up had been extended for a second 90-day period.
   ``We'll stay until the job's done, but let's just get going. I
think it's time to make a statement,'' he told a reporter.
   Bush emphasized several times that Iraq soon could be a nuclear
power, though experts put the timetable at five years or more. It
was the first time he'd raised the issue as a key component of his
anti-Iraq policy.
   ``No one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic
weapons or exactly who they may be aimed at down the road. But we
do know this for sure: he's never possessed a weapon he didn't
use,'' Bush said.
   Bush's journey took him through Europe and the Middle East.
Before flying to Paris last week for a 34-nation summit, he stopped
in Prague, becoming the first U.S. president ever to visit
Czechoslovakia. After a weekend at Camp David, Bush will depart
Monday for an overnight visit in Mexico.

<HEAD>Rebels Kill Japanese, Note Links Murder To Fujimori's Background</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maoist rebels with machine guns shot and
killed a man believed to be a Japanese citizen, leaving a note
saying the man was slain because he and Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori are of the same race, police say.
   The attack in an eastern jungle late Wednesday would be the
first killing of a Japanese citizen in Peru's 10 years of political
violence that hs left more than 20,000 people dead.
   The same rebel group earlier Wednesday killed the wife and
mother-in-law of an official in the same village, police said
Thursday. Hours later in the same area, police killed 10 rebels
when they ambushed a large column of Shining Path guerrillas. Two
policemen died in the firefight.
   Police identified the Japanese citizen as 45-year-old Wakamiya
Makamori. They said he was visiting Peruvian friends who own farms
in the area.
   The village where Makamori was killed, Alto Paureli, is located
20 miles southeast of Satipo, a jungle town 170 miles east of Lima.
   Police said Makamori was shot by six rebels armed with machine
guns. The rebels stopped Makamori's car as they were leaving the
village after killing the two women, police said.
   The rebels left a note next to Makamori's body that said he was
killed ``for being Japanese, like Fujimori.''
   Police said Makamori's money, passport and other documents were
taken by the rebels. His body was identified by the friends he had
been visiting, police said.
   Makamori's body was taken Thursday to Satipo, police said. It
was to be flown to Lima today, they said.
   The reports were issued by police in Huancayo, a mountainous
state capital 120 miles east of Lima.
   The Japanese Embassy Thursday said it had not yet been informed
of the attack.
   Government officials have said the number of Japanese tourists
to Peru has increased since Fujimori was elected Peru's president
in June. Fujimori parents were both born in Japan.
   About 60,000 Peruvians trace their heritage to Japan. The colony
is the second largest in South America, after Brazil.
   Police said their clash with the rebel column took place outside
Gloriabamba, a village 15 miles southeast of Satipo.
   Police said there were about 150 rebels in the column. The
firefight lasted over four hours, they said.
   More than 20,000 Peruvians have been killed in political
violence since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.

   Americans gorged themselves on turkey and watched parades and
football on Thanksgiving, but the dy for family get-togethers was
bittersweet for those with loved ones in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We'll all be aware of the empty place at the table,'' Vernon
Hunt, 56, of Des Plaines, Ill., said before his family sat down to
dinner. Hunt's son, Stephen, is a Marine stationed on a battleship
in the Persian Gulf.
   The holiday was gloomier for diplomats and others held captive
by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Embassy staff in Kuwait dined on
canned tuna fish washed down with water salvaged from a swimming
pool.
   Some hostages in Iraq were treated to lavish Thanksgiving feasts
attended by news reporters before they returned to detention at
strategic sites or virtual house arrest in Baghdad.
   President Bush was upbeat while visiting troops in the Persian
Gulf. First lady Barbara Bush wore desert camouflage gear and
waited in a military chow line with the president for helpings of
turkey.
   Stateside, soldiers destined to join those overseas enjoyed a
parting taste of home cooking and family time.
   ``We're just really thankful I'm here for this one. We're
cutting it real close here,'' said Marine Sgt. Gerald Pennington, a
reserve from Connecticut whose unit is being activated Sunday for
possible Persian Gulf duty.
   More than 200,000 American troops have been sent to the Middle
East since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and their numbers are set
to double in coming months.
   Also growing are the numbers of needy as the nation's economy
sours.
   ``We're seeing a big increase in the number of people who need
food and shelter this year because of the recession and layoffs,''
said Maj. Carl Ruthberg of the Salvation Army in Cincinnati. ``In
many cases, these are people who have never been laid off before
and don't know how to deal with it.''
   Ruthberg said his organization doubled the number of
Thanksgiving dinners given out last year. Similar increases were
reported nationwide.
   Civil rights activist Hosea Williams estimated 25,000 people got
a hot meal at his 22nd annual Thanksgiving dinner in Atlanta. The
Salvation Army cooked turkey dinners for 10,000 in New York City.
In San Francisco, 6,000 people showed up for a holiday meal at
Glide Memorial Methodist Church.
   ``Things are definitely different this year,'' said the Rev.
Cecil Williams of the Glide church. ``There's been the recession,
the crisis in the Persian Gulf, the uncomfortable inconsistencies
of the charitable givers ... and the children, more than we've ever
seen.''
   Even one of the most festive Thanksgiving traditions - the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City - was tinged with
sadness this year.
   A giant helium-filled balloon of Kermit the Frog returned to the
parade in honor of Muppets creator Jim Henson, who died this year.
``Kermit makes me sad,'' said Paul Oppold, 27, who lost his smile
when the green frog came into view.
   And at the end of the parade, about 20 AIDS activists unfurled
banners that read, ``4,752 AIDS Deaths 'till Christmas'' and ``Ask
Santa Claus for National Health Care.''
   More than 1 million people lined the streets to watch the
marching bands, floats and balloons in the 64th annual Macy's
parade.
   Joining the helium-filled cartoon character balloons this year
was Bart Simpson, barreling down Broadway on a 35-foot-long
skateboard.
   St. Louis moved its Christmas parade up to Thanksgiving this
year. It featured three 60-foot-high helium balloons, including one
of Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent.
   More than 150,000 people watched a Thanksgiving Day parade in
Detroit, but only a pilot flying at 5,000 feet got to see the
30-foot-long helium balloon of Chilly Willy the penguin.
   The flightless bird took to the sky the nigh before when it
broke free of its moorings. The $15,000 balloon was recovered later
from a lake 35 miles away.
   Detroit also was home once again for one of the traditional
Thanksgiving day football games watched on television by millions
nationwide. The Detroit Lions beat the Denver Broncos 40-27. In
Dallas, the other traditional Thanksgiving day combatant, the
Cowboys, beat the Washington Redskins 27-17.
   While many Americans were too stuffed with food to make it off
the living room couch, 30,000 people ran a marathon in Atlanta over
a course mapped for the event in the 1996 Olympics.
   Four of the country's 10 oldest road races are run on
Thanksgiving, according to Runner's World magazine. They are the
5-mile Turkey Trot in Buffalo, first run in 1896; the Thanksgiving
Day 5-Mile Race in New Orleans (1907); the Elks Thanksgiving Day
Race in Cincinnati (1908); and the Berwick 9-Mile Race in Berwick,
Pa. (1908).
   ``Now I know I can justify eating a lot of turkey, drinking some
beers and eating some cake because I've got my workout in,'' Sean
McCrossen said after finishing the Buffalo race.

   Rain was widespread across the Deep South today and was
scattered across the Midwest and northeast.
   Rain and rising temperatures melted snow across much of the
higher elevations in western Washington state, causing rivers to
rise and bringing scattered flood warnings. Advisories for locally
heavy rain were in effect.
   Warnings for gale-force winds were posted for the Washington and
Oregon coasts. High wind alerts were issued in eastern Wyoming, the
Columbia basin of Oregon and the Idaho panhandle.
   Gusts of 70 mph were recorded in eastern Wyoming on Thursday
while 55 to 60 mph gusts were widespread in eastern Montana.
   Snow was expected in the northwest mountains of Montana.
Blowing, drifting snow was forecast for the north-central mountains
of Wyoming.
   Rain dampened broad sections of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama,
Georgia and Tennessee. Rain today also reached into Kentucky, the
lower Midwest and western Pennsylvania. New York and Maine had
widely scattered showers.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 88 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.

   In a move to increase central control over Hong

British colony, the government said today.
   Since the June 1989 crackdown a pro-democracy movement in
Beijing that was popularly supported in Hong Kong, Communist China
has sought to tighten control over the territory before it reverts
to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Tens of thousands of the colony's residents concerned about
Communist control have sought permission to move out.
   A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said that
Lu Ping, who has been deputy director since 1987, will take over
the directorship. He replaces Ji Pengfei, who headed the office for
the past eight years.
   Ji, a former foreign minister with close ties to China's top
leaders, exercised a degree of independence in formulating policy
for Hong Kong, the capitalist port bordering south China.
   The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office is under the State
Council, China's Cabinet, and is the highest government organ
dealing with the two territories.
   Lu, 63, has been involved in Hong Kong affairs since 1978 and
was deputy secretary-general of the Basic Law Drafting Committee,
which wrote the mini-constitution for Hong Kong after it reverts to
Chinese rule.
   He is considered to have a greater understanding of Hong Kong
issues and to be more open and approachable than his predecessor,
who visited the colony only once during his tenure.
   However, Lu lacks Ji's status among Chinese leaders. Since the
military attack on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, he has
been careful to follow the Communist Party line and has been less
outspoken on issues concerning Hong Kong.
   The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po of Hong Kong said Ji and Li would
retain their posts as chairman and vice-chariman of the Macao Basic
Law Drafting Committee. Macao, a Portugese colony, is to return to
Chinese rule in 1999.
   As part of a 1984 agreement, China promised to maintain Hong
Kong's freewheeling economic and social system under a program it
calls ``one country, two systems.''
   But after the June 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy groups in
China, many in the territory lost faith in China's promise. Hong
Kong people also question British assurances of its support up
until 1997, when Britain's 99-year lease on the colony runs out.
   The British government is offering about 225,000 Hong Kong
residents the right to live in Britain. According to Hong Kong
immigration officials, about 3.5 million of Hong Kong's 5.7 million
people are eligible for consideration under the package.
   
   Already more than 1,000 people a week are emigrating, mainly to
Australia and Canada, because they fear a loss of rights and
opportunities when Hong Kong comes under Chinese rule.

   Gas station owners say the city's
latest move to curb drunken drivers is about as appealing as warm
beer.
   Uncooled beer and wine are the only alcoholic beverages gas
stations can sell now, thanks to a recent ruling by the city's
planning commission aimed at making chilled spirits less convenient
to drivers making pit stops.
   ``It's going to hurt business,'' said Mehrzad Hamzeh, owner of a
Shell station located next to a grocery store that can sell cold
beer. ``People don't want to take warm beer home and then wait for
it to get cold in the freezer. This is a ridiculous law.''
   City officials defended the rule, arguing that the rising
incidence of drunken driving requires drastic countermeasures.
   ``The city is trying to send an appropriate message - alcohol
and gasoline don't mix,'' Planning Commissioner Mike Gorman said.
   Walnut Creek is a San Francisco Bay area city about 10 miles
east of Oakland.

<HEAD>EC 1992 Drive Lags Behind in Several Key Sectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's drive to
create a unified internal market by the end of 1992 is lagging
behind schedule in key areas, according to an EC Commission report.
   A delay not only would affect EC businesses and citizens, but
also American and other foreign investors who anticipate a
borderless EC market after Dec. 31, 1992.
   ``We cannot allow failure,'' the commission said in a statement
Thursday.
   Nowhere has progress been slower in streamlining member states'
policies than in the area of Value Added Taxes and excise duties,
the commission said in the report it released Thursday.
   It also blamed tardiness in many EC states to adapt national
laws to EC legislation.
   In contrast, it said progress was being made in other areas such
as liberalizing capital movement, the banking sector, stock
exchanges and insurance.
   But it warned that delays in setting up the internal market
would affect the European drive for economic and monetary union
after 1992.
   The commission's attempts to replace often-contradictory
national laws with unified rules often clash with national
aspirations of the member states. The Commission proposes EC
legislation that must be adopted or amended by the 12 EC states to
take effect.
   The commission criticized the 12 EC governments for slow
progress in harmonizing VAT taxes and duties.
   Despite commitments to set up a unified VAT system and excise
duties, ``no precise measure has been taken,'' said the statement.
The Commission said it ``regretted the lack of ambition of the 12
(governments).''
   In the EC's view, the drive towards a single market is vital to
EC businesses that have already invested heavily in an EC-wide
strategy.
   In 1989 alone, there were 1,300 cross-border acquisitions valued
at a total of 30 billion European Currency units ($41.7 billion.)
   A single market is also seen as important for attracting foreign
investors to the Community.
   Direct investment in the trade bloc by U.S. companies surged to
$126.5 billion in 1988 from $84 billion in 1985. During the same
period, Japanese investments rose to $8.3 billion from $2 billion,
the commission said.
   The commission urged a speeding up of the drive for a single
market, saying that ``confronted with a panoply of police and
custom checks (at the EC's internal borders) the European citizen
has the right to question, barely two years before the end date,
the political promises.''
   To make progress in that area, the commission wants to
strengthen controls at the trade bloc's external borders and
coordinate the fight against international terrorism, drug
trafficking and clandestine immigration.

   The Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers today
reiterated their countries' demand that Iraq end its occupation of
Kuwait, after meeting in a remote border town.
   But Qian Qichen of China and Eduard Shevardnadze of the Soviet
Union did not say whether they had reached agreement on the next
step to defuse the crisis.
   ``Both sides are firmly opposed to Iraq's invasion and
annexation of Kuwait and demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait as
soon as possible,'' China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Qian
as saying.
   It said Qian reported the two men ``shared many points in
common,'' but did not elaborate. Soviet Embassy spokesman Yuri
Lyssenko said he had no information on the talks in the Chinese
city of Urumqi, near the two countries' Central Asian border.
   Xinhua said Qian and Shevardnadze first met for 90 minutes, each
accompanied only by an aide and a translator. Talks then were
expanded to include officials of each side's foreign ministry.
   Shevardnadze left for Moscow later today, the Soviet Embassy
said. He arrived in Urumqi this morning for the meeting, which was
announced only a day before.
   The United States has been lobbying for a U.N. Security Council
resolution authorizing the use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
But both Moscow and Beijing have stressed the need to seek a
peaceful solution.
   As permanent members of the Security Council, both countries
have veto power over any resolutions. The United States, France and
Britain are the other permanent members.
   On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said
the question of using force ``should not be hurried through.''
   ``As long as there is still a gleam of hope for a peaceful
settlement, unremitting efforts should be continued for this,'' he
said.
   Foreign journalists were not allowed to cover today's meeting in
Urumqi, 1,500 miles west of Beijing. The venue may have been chosen
in part for its privacy.
   It was the second time Shevardnadze has flown into China for
consulations since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. The first
meeting was in Harbin on Sept. 1, and it signaled a new, pragmatic
working relationship between the two neighbors.
   China and the Soviet Union, both ruled by Communist parties,
were close allies in the 1950s but split in the 1960s over
ideological and strategic differences. They normalized relations
only last year with a summit in Beijing, and political, economic
and military contacts have greatly increased since then.

   President Bush met with Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak today and said the international coalition demanding Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait ``will not rest'' until the task is
achieved.
   ``There is complete identity of views'' between the United
States and Egypt, Bush said, and Mubarak's words echoed his own.
``The Iraqi invasion must be reversed and Kuwait must be
liberated,'' the Egyptian leader said.
   Bush, who met with U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf on
Thanksgiving Day, was leaving the Middle East after the news
conference. He was traveling to Geneva for a quick meeting with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis
before heading home for Washington.
   Bush has been seeking support for a United Nations resolution
authorizing the use of force to evict Iraq from Kuwait. ``I can
assure you that the world still has violent disapproval of what
Saddam Hussein has done and that they will be supportive of any
action this coalition takes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Raises Questions About Death Row Inmate's Guilt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old police report raises questions about
whether a death row inmate committed the murder for which he was
condemned, a newspaper reported today.
   Two experts hired by The Dallas Morning News - a former police
officer and a former FBI agent - said Tyler police apparently drew
the wrong conclusions from evidence found at the murder scene and
later presented an improbable version of events at Kerry Max Cook's
1978 capital murder trial.
   Cook, who maintains his innocence, was sentenced to die for the
1977 slaying of Linda Jo Edwards, 21, of Tyler.
   The News reported today that the June 14, 1977, police report,
which the newspaper obtained from a confidential source, cites
evidence that may have pointed to other possible suspects. Among
the evidence was four hair samples.
   One of Cook's attorneys said prosecutors never told the defense
about that evidence.
   ``The physical evidence, particularly foreign hairs on her body,
reports of those should have been submitted to us,'' said John
Ament, one of two attorneys who represented Cook.
   Tyler lawyer A.D. Clark III, who was Smith County's district
attorney at the time of the trial, said his office turned over
everything it was required to. He also supported the police theory
of how the crime took place.
   Police say Cook snuck into Ms. Edwards' apartment through an
unlocked patio door, saw her sleeping on the couch, picked up a
statue and began beating her with it.
   The News' experts were skeptical.
   ``I would definitely say the wrong conclusion was reached,''
said Phil Ethridge, a former Tulsa policeman who teaches at the
University of Texas-Pan American.
   Ethridge and Jerry Dowling, a former FBI special agent now with
Sam Houston State University's criminal justice program, say the
police report does not support the police theory that Ms. Edwards
was sleeping when she was attacked.
   The report said police found the television on with the ``volume
in a normal listening area'' when they entered Ms. Edwards'
bedroom. Officers also found a hot iron upright on an ironing board
in the bedroom, the report said.
   Ms. Edwards pants, the only item of her clothing not torn or
bloodstained, lay nearby. The report also noted that there was
blood on the top of the ironing board.
   The professors questioned whether the woman would be sleeping
with both the television and the iron on. The blood on top of the
ironing board indicates she may have been standing when the attack
began, they said.
   ``None of the physical evidence inside the crime scene really
links (Cook) to the crime,'' Dowling said. ``There's a lot of
blood, but you don't get his fingerprints on the weapons, you don't
have blood on his clothing or whatever.
   ``I don't know whether the guy did it or not, but I'm not overly
impressed with what evidence they say suggests that he did it.''
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is considering whether to
throw out Cook's conviction and sentence because of constitutional
questions surrounding the testimony in the punishment phase of his
trial.

   Speaking at a joint news conference, Bush said, ``We're getting
tired of the status quo, and so is the rest of the world.
   Mubarak has been a front-line partner in the United States'
effort to force Iraq's withdrawal, sending several thousand troops
to Saudi Arabia as part of the effort to deter further aggression.
   ``For us it's a matter of principles and moral values,'' he
said.
   Mubarak also used the news conference to call for greater
international effort to deal with the ``plight of the Palestinian
people.'' He added. ``The holy shrines of Jerusalem muyst be
respected and protected.''
   Bush, asked about the subject, said the United States is eager
for an overall Middle Eastern peace agreement. But, he swiftly
said, ``What I am equally determined to do is to keep these two
questions separate. There is no linkage.''

   A strong earthquake shook an area along Japan's
western coast this evening, but there were no immediate reports of
damage or casualties, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   The temblor, which struck at about 7:42 p.m. (5:42 a.m. EST),
had a preliminary reading of 5.0 on the Richter scale, the agency
said.
   The epicenter was about 400 miles southwest of Tokyo in the
western Tottori prefecture, a moderately populated coastal area.
   Police in Tottori, contacted about a half hour after the quake,
reported no injuries or damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded by
seismographs. Every increase of one means a tenfold increase in
magnitude. An earthquake of five on the Richter sale is considered
``very strong.''
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Offer To Surrender, With Conditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Medellin cocaine cartel says
hundreds of its members are willing to accept a government offer
not to extradite them if they turn themselves in. But the members
still refused to confess to crimes.
   A cartel statement Thursday to President Cesar Gaviria also said
the members wanted special protection and would be willing to stay
in a special compound guarded by the army.
   The traffickers' statement did not indicate if the offer to
surrender applied to Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel's leader.
   Such a surrender by between 200 and 300 cartel members ``implies
the end of all activities related to drug trafficking or
narcoterrorism,'' the statement said.
   The government, seeking to end a 15-month-old war with drug
traffickers that has left more than 500 people dead, responded to
the communique by extending an olive branch.
   Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo outlined a series of legal
guarantees drug traffickers would enjoy if they surrendered.
   In September, Gaviria offered to prohibit extraditions and
reduce jail sentences of drug traffickers who surrendered and
confessed their crimes.
   In Thursday's statement, the traffickers were apparently
accepting Gaviria's offer, with conditions.
   These included trafficker's request that they not be required to
confess, as the Gaviria offer demands. They said such confessions
would constitute self-incrimination, ``prohibited even in the
United States.''
   ``A confession of all crimes committed is not required, just
some of them,'' said Justice Minister Giraldo.
   He said surrendering drug traffickers ``can be sure they will
not be extradited.''
   The traffickers said they would expect, upon turning themselves
in, special army protection and vigilance by international human
rights organizations.
   The Medellin cartel has been blamed for the deaths of around 550
Colombians since the government and drug traffickers declared war
on each other after a political assassination in August 1989.
   During the past three months, traffickers have kidnapped nine
journalists, some of whom belong to the country's most influential
families.
   Drug bosses have said the abductions are a response to human
rights abuses by police in Medellin, the cartel's home city.
   They are also apparently trying to pressure authorities to grant
them a pardon.
   In Thursday's statement, the drug lords said they should not be
treated like common criminals.

   John F. Kennedy Jr., who recently passed the

<TEXT>
   A secret Swiss resistance force that
would have mounted guerrilla warfare against foreign occupiers has
been ordered dissolved, the government said today.
   The government was responding to a report by a parliamentary
commission that said the clandestine resistance group was set up by
military officials outside political control.
   The force also was supposed to be used against domestic
subversion.
   But the danger of invasion is receding with the democratization
of eastern Europe and the government ``is ready to abolish the
vestiges of the Cold War,'' the seven-member federal executive
said.
   It said it formally abolished the force, codenamed P-26, last
week.
   Switzerland's announcement followed recent revelations of a
clandestine network of guerrilla units and arms caches, organized
in NATO countries in the 1950s, that would have coordinated
resistance in case of a Warsaw Pact invasion of western Europe.
   Today's parliamentary report said it found no evidence that the
Swiss group had ``direct links'' with NATO's paramilitary network.
But it said the unit cooperated with an unidentified NATO country
in developing telecommunications equipment.
   About 400 people participated in P-26, most of them weapons,
telecommunications and psychological warfare experts, the report
said.
   The group, secretly financed by the defense department,
maintained a network of mostly underground installations throughout
Switzerland. Its commander was a private citizen who could mobilize
the force without consulting army or government.
   The parliamentary commission said a parallel undercover military
intelligence network was set up in 1980. But it dismissed its
reports as no more valuable than what could be gained by a careful
reading of daily newspapers.
   The parliament investigation centered on Switzerland's Defense
Ministry. The probe was launched after revelations that the
ministry, along with other government offices, kept secret files on
citizens.

   Radical students fought riot police
with firebombs and rocks today and demanded an end to U.S. pressure
to open Korean trade and agriculture markets.
   The nation's top opposition leader, Kim Dae-jung, warned of more
political unrest over the issue.
   But Deputy Premier Lee Seung-yun took a conciliatory tone and
said South Korea would try to ease tensions with the United States.
   The nation's major dissident and radical student organizations
said they would hold more demonstrations on Sunday. Police said
illegal protests would be blocked and security would be tightened
around U.S. facilities.
   About 4,000 students at 16 universities in Seoul staged rallies
today and battled riot police, news reports said. At Sogang
University, about 500 students hurled hundreds of rocks and
firebombs, and police fired volleys of choking tear gas from
armored vans.
   Another 400 students clashed with police in southern Kwangju
city, the reports said.
   There were no reports of arrests or injuries.
   Opposition leader Kim told Parliament that the nation would face
major unrest unless Roh halts ``suppressive rule'' using security
organizations to crack down on dissidents, workers and students.
   Kim also said the country should ``sternly cope with America's
unrealistic pressure to open its markets, especially farm
products.''
   It was Kim's first speech to the National Assembly since his
group, the Party for Peace and Democracy, ended a four-month
boycott and returned to Parliament Monday.
   All 78 opposition legislators walked out of the 299-member
Parliament in July, charging the governing party with railroading
bills and reneging on democratic reforms.
   Dissidents and farmers have staged violent anti-government and
anti-American protests, denouncing U.S. pressure on South Korea to
open its agricultural markets wider.
   South Korean consumer and civil groups have threatened to launch
a nationwide boycott against U.S. goods.
   In an address Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg said
negative views of America have become widespread in South Korea and
threaten to poison economic and political relations between the
countries.
   Deputy Premier Lee, also the economic planning minister, said
the government will try to end trade controversies with foreign
governments, especially Washington.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota may become the home of Mr.
Clean, Charlie Tuna, the Michelin Man and other icons and critters
of Madison Avenue.
   An executive at the Museum of Modern Mythology, which features
advertising characters and mass market trademarks, talked to city
officials Tuesday about moving the museum from San Francisco to St.
Paul.
   ``We think it would be a good place for the museum - the Twin
Cities is a creative arts mecca,'' said Ellen Havre Weis, the
executive director and co-founder of the popular culture museum.
   The museum is based on the premise that advertising characters
and slogans have so infiltrated the subconscious minds of
modern-day Americans that they are the closest things we have to
myth.
   Advertising also offers interesting examples of the development
of art and social attitudes over the past century, according to
museum officials.
   The mythology museum was forced to close when the earthquake in
the San Francisco Bay area in October 1989 ruined its building.
Since then, museum officials have been looking for a new home.
   Although other cities have expressed interest, St. Paul and
Berkeley, Calif., are the two sites under active consideration,
Weis said.
   The Twin Cities would be a good home for the museum, Weis said,
because it is a nationally known advertising community and has a
reputation for corporate philanthropy.
   Weis said it is hoped that the decision on a new location can be
made within six months. The museum was started in 1982 by Weis,
graphic artist Jeffrey Errick and media consultant Matthew Cohen.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bizarre Thanksgiving celebration at an
exclusive country club, a dozen American hostages and a few
relatives who came to see them sat down to eat with their Iraqi
captors.
   The hostages, who were being held as ``human shields'' at
various strategic sites, were brought Thursday to Baghdad's Hunting
Club in the fashionable Mansour district of the capital.
   Iraqi government officials joined the Americans for lunch -
turkey, chicken, ham and cranberry sauce - which was arranged by
the American Red Cross Society. The Iraqis provided the wine for
the meal.
   The hostages were brought from unidentified strategic locations
as far away as 280 miles west and north, officials said. No guards
were seen at the club.
   Bill Stevenson said he, his brother, James, and sister, Mary
Trundy, came to Baghdad to speak of peace, to see their brother
John and to take him home with them.
   The first two they have done; the third and most important will
have to wait.
   Iraqi officials did release some hostages on Thanksgiving. But
none of them was American.
   Stevenson, 54, was among several Americans who have flown to
Baghdad since Saddam Hussein invited relatives of captives to visit
them.
   He said he got no encouragement for his private mission from his
neighbors, co-workers or the government. He said he had to quit his
job in Panama City, Fla., to travel to Iraq.
   His brother, John, 44, a computer specialist who had worked in
Kuwait for more than 10 years, was picked up in October in Kuwait
and eventually taken to a military site in Iraq.
   ``We are a very close, tight-knit family,'' said Bill. ``I am
here for my brother.''
   Despite the circumstances, the atmosphere at the Hunting Club
was convivial. Some hostages had known each other in Kuwait before
they were seized during the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2.
   They embraced each other as they met for the first time since
then.
   They mingled on the well-manicured lawn outside the club,
sipping soft drinks before moving into the dining room for lunch.
Some passed on the wine, and ordered beer.
   The Iraqis gave them presents of bottles of liquor.
   More than 100 Americans are among 600 Westerners, including
Britons and Japanese, held at key military and industrial sites to
prevent any attack by U.S.-led forces arrayed against Iraq in the
Persian Gulf following its invasion.
   Among those brought to the club was Donald Whitely, 49, of
Shreveport, La., who is believed to be the first American seized by
the Iraqis less than 30 minutes after they invaded Kuwait.
   Whitely said he was sleeping in the Kuwait Oil Co. camp in an
oilfield near the border when the Iraqis stormed in. He was held
with three other American drillers.
   ``I've a legitimate reason to go home,'' he said. ``My father's
very ill and I want to see him before he dies.''
   He said he suffered from an ear ailment and needed urgent
surgery.
   Whitely disclosed that he has been held at a telecommunications
center near Baghdad, but received ``adequate food'' and was able to
receive telephone calls from his family in the United States.
   Billy Rodebush, 53, of McAlester, Okla., who was also seized in
Kuwait Aug. 2, said: ``On Thanksgiving Day we should be reunited
with our families. This is what the day is for. Nobody should be
detained against his will.''
   Nigel Nightingale, another hostage, was reunited with his wife,
Jean.
   She said she has appealed to Iraqi officials to let her husband
go, but so far has received no response.
   The Iraqis have allowed them to stay together in a Baghdad hotel
for a few days before he is taken back to the strategic site where
he has been held.
   Mrs. Nightingale said she has been treated well since she
arrived in Baghdad a few days ago.

<HEAD>Slovaks Begin Voting in Tight Contest for Local Councils</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nationalists in Slovakia,
Hungary's ethnically troubled rural republic, tested their
political strength today in local council and mayoral elections.
   The two days of balloting in Slovakia and one day of voting in
the Czech republic on Saturday will complete the nation's
transition to democracy by replacing councils dominated by
Communists for four decades.
   Ninety-sevn parties fielded more than 232,000 candidates for
about 100,000 seats on local and regional councils in both
republics. About 2,700 towns in Slovakia also will choose mayors.
Polling ends in both republics Saturday night, and the first
results are expected late Sunday.
   Civic Forum, the loose democratic coalition founded by President
Vaclav Havel, is the clear favorite in elections in the Czech
republic. But Public Against Violence, its counterpart in Slovakia,
is facing a stiff challenge from Christian Democrats and the
nationalist Slovak National Party.
   The last pre-election poll indicated Public Against Violence
would win about 29 percent of the vote, followed by the Christian
Democrats with 27 percent and the nationalist party with 17
percent.
   Elections are expected to be close in southern Slovakia, where
most of the nation's ethnic Hungarians live.
   Last month, the Slovak parliament passed a law allowing the
600,000 ethnic Hungarians in the republic to use their language in
official communications in areas where they represent more than 20
percent of the population. Angry nationalists responded with a wave
of street protests.
   Hungarians make up more than 10 percent of Slovakia's 5.5
million people.
   Many Czechoslovaks who voted this summer to oust Communists and
replace them with democratic forces have become disillusioned with
what has been accomplished since.
   ``This time the idea is to choose the best people on the basis
of their ability to do something for the community,'' Slovak radio
said in a commentary today hours before polls opened. ``But in the
big cities, where people do not know each other, their party
allegiance will be all that matters.''
   There have been concerns that voter turnout would be low, but
recent polls indicated up to 70 percent of the voters would
participate. A record 97 percent voted in the June parliamentary
elections.
   ``Maybe we are all tired, but right now we cannot afford to
sleep late, because we still have to wake democracy up,'' Slovensky
Dennik, the Christian Democratic daily, said today.

<HEAD>Criminal's True Identity Discovered Nearly 5 Years After
Sentencing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was imprisoned for nearly five
years under a false name even though authorities suspected he was
lying about his identity was finally tripped up by an offhand
reference to Hawaii, authorities said.
   Authorities didn't know much about the man who was sentenced as
Joseph P. Caldwell in early 1986 in Pierce County Superior Court.
Because his history was a blank, he received a lighter sentence
than he might have if is criminal past had been known.
   The man went to extraordinary lengths to hide his identity for
four years - including using an iron to burn off four tattoos,
authorities said.
   But an investigator found out earlier this year that Caldwell is
really Randall J. Peters, a man who had prior convictions for
robbery and burglary in Hawaii and Texas and faced rape charges in
Skagit County.
   Monday, Peters will be resentenced in Superior Court for the
1985 shooting and robbery, based on his true criminal history.
   At the time of his 1985 trial, authorities were suspicious
Peters wasn't who he claimed to be. He appeared younger than 40 -
the age he told them - and he'd given police a bogus address.
   But the man's fingerprints weren't in state records, and he had
no peculiar marks that could aid in identification, said Bruce
Jackson, chief criminal investigator for the Pierce County
prosecutor.
   After Peters' conviction, Judge E. Albert Morrison handed down
an exceptional sentence of 20 years for the armed robbery and
shooting.
   But the state Court of Appeals overturned the sentence, saying
neither the nature of the assault nor the man's apparent
unwillingness to give his true name justified the exceptional
punishment, said deputy prosecutor Doug Hill, who originally tried
the case.
   Peters received a new sentence of 4{ years for first-degree
robbery and 8{ years for first-degree assault. He was sent to the
state prison at Walla Walla.
   Prison officials also were suspicious of the man's identity,
said Tim Anderson, an investigator for the Pierce County
prosecutor. The inmate never got mail or visitors, and he never
talked about his past.
   When Peters refused to allow X-rays during a routine dental
visit, prison authorities began collecting every file and bit of
prison intelligence they had on him and sending it to the Pierce
County prosecutor's office.
   Anderson sifted through the box of information and came upon an
offhand reference Peters made to Hawaii. On a hunch, Anderson sent
a copy of Peters' fingerprints to the Honolulu Police Department.
   ``I thought it was a long shot. But Honolulu came back with a
match,'' Anderson said. ``They said they knew him, but under
another name. ... I couldn't believe it when I got the fax from
them. I called the (Honolulu) detective back and said, `Is this
really the same guy?'''
   It turned out Peters had two convictions for robbery in Hawaii
and two theft convictions in Texas. He also was wanted in Skagit
County, Anderson said.
   Peters was then turned over to Skagit County, which convicted
him on two counts of first-degree rape and one count of
third-degree indecent liberties for attacks that happened before
the Tacoma crimes, Hill said. He was sentenced to 33 years.
   Hill says he'll recommend on Monday that Morrison sentence
Peters to 20 years, the maximum allowed under the law for the
Tacoma shooting and robbery.

   Thousands of people returned turkeys to
Tucson-area Smith's supermarkets in the wake of the scare created
when a man called a television station saying he had injected some
birds with deadly cyanide.
   The supermarket chain had removed all turkeys from its Tucson
stores and offered refunds or exchanges to customers who recently
had purchased turkeys after Wednesday night's call.
   Ninety to 95 percent of the customers asked for a refund on
Thursday, store officials said. Some of the returned turkeys were
already cooked.
   Barry Holinski, meat supervisor for the chain in Tucson, said he
didn't know how many birds were pulled from the shelves, how many
were returned, or how much the incident will cost Smith's. But at
one store alone, more than 2,000 turkeys were returned.
   The withdrawal was limited to the four Tucson-area stores, a
Smith's official said Thursday.
   ``It's sad that it happened on the Thanksgiving holiday,''
spokesman Ken Findley said in Phoenix.
   Tucson police said Thursday that no evidence had been found that
any turkeys sold by Smith's Food and Drug stores actually had been
injected with the poison.
   Reporter-anchor Barbara Grijalva of KOLD-TV took a call
Wednesday from a man who said he ``had a problem with Smith's,''
KOLD producer Rob Daniels said.
   The man said he had injected some of the turkeys on sale at
Smith's with cyanide but did not say which Smith's stores were
involved or when he allegedly poisoned the turkeys.
   He said he injected the turkeys ``to prove a point,'' and
declined to elaborate.
   Sgt. Roberto Villasenor, spokesman for the Tucson Police
Department, said police had no suspects.
   All turkeys returned to Smith's will be taken to a landfill for
disposal, said James Robertson of the Pima County Health
Department.

   Leaders around the world hailed Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's achievements, with President Bush calling her
an outstanding ally and the Soviets praising her for helping end
the Cold War.
   But Iraq said it is not displeased she is going.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who on Thursday announced her plans to step down,
got a call from Bush, who was visiting U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
He told her ``we love you'' and said he was ``very upset'' she was
quitting, said a spokesman at her 10 Downing Street office.
   The spokesman said Bush told Mrs. Thatcher in the 10-minute call
that she had served not only Britain but the cause for which they
both stood with distinction and strength.
   The spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher told Bush about her
government's decision the same day to send 14,000 more armed
services personnel to the Persian Gulf to bolster the international
force confronting Iraq.
   The move will boost the number of British ground troops, sailors
and air crews to 30,000.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government, in a recent blast,
called Mrs. Thatcher a ``hag.'' But Iraqi information minister
Latif Nassayif Jassim said Thursday that while Iraq was not
displeased she was going, it was not hostile to her personally.
   In Moscow, Soviet Prime Minster Nikolai Ryzhkov told reporters:
``I'm very sorry that she has resigned, because she was a very
strong, very prominent politician.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp. today quoted an unnamed Soviet
spokesman as saying Mrs. Thatcher was a historic figure who had
helped bring the Soviet Union closer to Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher, on first meeting Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1984 declared: ``I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do
business together.''
   In her 11{ years as prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher traveled
widely and established herself as a leading world stateswoman, as
much at home on U.S. television as among crowds of enthusiastic
well-wishers on Soviet streets.
   Dubbed the ``Iron Lady'' by the Soviets before the ending of the
Cold War, she was a close ally of former President Reagan.
   Reagan, who was president from 1981 to 1988, said in a message
following her resignation announcement: ``Margaret Thatcher is
truly a world statesman,'' he said.
   Vitaly Ignatenko, spokesman for Gorbachev, told the Interfax
news agency: ``Political, economic and cultural ties between our
countries have become of greater importance'' under the Thatcher
era. ``Our relations during this period were marked by
constructivism and dialogue.''
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel telephoned Mrs. Thatcher's
office today and told her: ``You're always welcome in
Czechoslovakia.''
   NATO secretary-general Manfred Woerner said: ``The success of
our alliance in the last decade would not have been possible
without her vision, courage and steadfastness.''
   Mrs. Thatcher resolutely backed the deployment in Britain and
other NATO countries of new U.S. missiles in the 1980s in response
to a build-up of Soviet weapons. The move was seen in NATO as
crucial in bringing the Soviets to the negotiating table.
   Jacques Delors, president of the executive commission of the
European Common Market, spoke of his high esteem for Mrs. Thatcher
despite their differences.
   She and Delors repeatedly clashed over her hostility to plans
for monetary and political integration in the 12-nation Community.
   Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president of France from 1974 to 1981
with whom she also clashed, said: ``She deserves our applause. It
must be said ... that the Iron Lady was a great lady.''
   Sir Rex Hunt, governor of the Falkland Islands at the time of
the 1982 war with Argentina, said: ``Her departure is a tragedy for
Britain, for the Falklands and for the world.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who sent a task force to restore the Falklands to
British rule, has consistently refused to discuss Argentina's
sovereignty claim to the South Atlantic colony.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry, in a statement released by the
official Xinhua News Agency, praised Mrs. Thatcher for having made:
``positive contributions to the development of Sino-British
relations and especially the settlement of the Hong Kong issue
during her tenure.''

   President Bush would have a
far better chance of getting Congress to approve the use of force
in the Persian Gulf if the United Nations first backed such a move,
congressional leaders said today.
   ``It would have some significant impact if the United Nations
granted such a resolution,'' House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
said after arriving home from a Thanksgiving visit to U.S. troops
in Saudi Arabia.
   Foley and other leaders said they had no commitment from Bush to
seek congressional approval before ordering a military action in
the Persian Gulf, should the president choose that option.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said a U.N. resolution
authorizing force against Iraq would improve Bush's chances but not
necessarily guarantee congressional approval if the president
sought it.
   ``It would depend upon the circumstances that exist at the
time,'' the Maine Democrat said.
   Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said he would urge Congress
to reconvene immediately if the United Nations endorsed force to
free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
   ``Then I would hope Congress would reconvene and take similar
action,'' the Kansas Republican said.
   In addition to joining Bush for Thanksgiving dinner with U.S.
forces at several posts around Saudi Arabia, the congressional
leaders met Thursday night with Saudi King Fahd. They described the
king as grateful for the U.S. deployment and said he indicated no
impatience with the stationing of hundreds or thousands of foreign
troops on Saudi soil.
   Dole said Fahd told him he planned to visit soon with some of
the American troops.
   The leaders said they came away from their trip impressed with
the readiness of U.S. troops and their morale after more than three
months in the Saudi desert and other gulf areas.
   ``It was a morale booster for us,'' Dole said.
   ``We found their readiness to be excellent and their morale to
be high,'' Foley said.
   The speaker said he did not believe Bush planned any imminent
policy switch. Dole agreed with that assessment but said he
believed conditions at the U.S. embassy in Kuwait, where diplomats
are running low on food, could be a ``flashpoint'' in the crisis in
the coming weeks.
   Democratic leaders Foley and Mitchell gave Bush high marks for
his handling of the crisis to date, although Mitchell said he had
``grave reservations'' about Bush's meeting with Syrian President
Hafez al Assad.
   Mitchell said Assad's Syria has `condoned terrorism and engaged
in terrorism and he certainly has an absymal human rights record.''
   Neither Dole nor House Minority leader Robert Michel of Illinois
expressed outright support for the meeting. But Michel said it made
sense because of Syria's role in the multinational force in Saudi
Arabia and because it borders Iraq and would play a huge role if
any hostilities erupted.
   Dole said Bush needed to be ``very careful in our dealings with
him'' but added that the meeting in the Saudi desert made some
sense because ``we happen to be on the same side'' in the gulf
crisis.

   A 3-year-old boy found a loaded gun in
his grandfather's motor home and shot himself, and he was in
critical condition today, authorities said.
   David Riggs shot himself on the right side below his rib cage on
Thanksgiving, said Jacksonville sheriff's Lt. D.G. Gueterman.
   No decision had been made whether the gun's owner would be
charged under a state law that makes it a felony to leave a loaded
handgun within the reach of a minor who uses it to kill or cause
serious injury, said Detective Fred Bachert.
   David's grandfather, Ken Riggs, said the family had finished
Thanksgiving dinner and he and a friend, John Dickey, went to pack
up their motor home.
   Dickey said he had left his .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in
a zippered case hidden in the motor home. Riggs and Dickey were
inside the garage when they heard a shot.
   ``We ran and I caught David running out the door,'' Riggs said.
``He was crying and he was shot.''
   The gun had been stored in a case under a day bed, and Dickey
had put bags of clothing over it, Bachert said.
   ``Did he make a reasonable effort to hide the gun? That's going
to be the question,'' Bachert said.
   David was in critical but stable condition at University Medical
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   Shoppers lined up early, some of them in the
rain, for today's unofficial start of the Christmas shopping
season, which retailers are viewing uneasily amid the troubled
economy and the Gulf crisis.
   ``There are three things you can count on: death, taxes and a
big day after Thanksgiving,'' said Steve Podalsky, manager of the
Marshall's department store at Sawgrass Mills, a discount shopping
mall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Podalsky said the newness of the mall, which opened in October,
and the appeal of discount shopping have gotten the store off to a
start ``beyond our expectations. It's as if there's nothing wrong
with the economy.''
   But most retailers don't expect business to boom, not with the
flagging economy and the Middle East crisis. Many shoppers are
expected to browse, not buy, this weekend.
   Phil Sawyer, manager of a J.C. Penney branch in Richmond, Va.,
predicted sales would slack off after a burst of buying today,
similar to the business his store had during a previous economic
slowdown.
   Wanda McNamara of New Cumberland, Pa., said today she has not
been personally threatened with layoffs or loss of income. Still,
she is taking the recession talk seriously and this shopping season
will be different for her.
   ``I'm watching my dollars,'' she said this morning while waiting
for Boscov's Department Store to open in Harrisburg, Pa. ``I'm more
careful, more selective. I'm looking for sales. I'm cutting down on
the Christmas list. I don't want to overcharge too much.''
   Stores generally make half their annual profits during the
Christmas season. The Thanksgiving weekend isn't quite as crucial
for retailers as it once was, though.
   Shoppers setting out after getting their fill of turkey and
football games used to give retailers their biggest three-day take
and set the tone for the rest of the Christmas period. But in
recent years, as more women joined the workforce, consumers have
been shopping later and later.
   Now, the last 10 days before Christmas matter most - though
Thanksgiving weekend sales help determine retailers' strategy for
the rest of the season.
   Retailers' biggest hope this season is to avoid the steep
markdowns that decimated earnings last Christmas. Many companies
competing with the department stores owned by Campeau Corp. had to
slash prices after Campeau's units, in a futile attempt at staying
out of bankruptcy court, took heavy markdowns to bring in sales.
   Christmas 1989 devastated some retailers, most notably R.H. Macy
&amp; Co, which was among those forced to take markdowns and ended up
with a $39 million loss in the second quarter of its fiscal year.
   Analysts believe there will be some markdowns this year, but
just how severe the price cuts will be depends on how the season
progresses.
   Edward Johnson, an analyst with Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, said
stores began taking markdowns a few weeks ago, but ``they're still
not as bad as they were last year.''
   If this weekend goes poorly, Johnson said, retailers may begin
their markdowns early in hopes of increasing sales.
   Manufacturers also are concerned about the success of this
weekend. They're waiting to see how well their products sell and
whether stores that have stocked their shelves conservatively place
reorders.

   Two Cabinet ministers launched campaigns today to
succeed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and they emphasized unity
in low-key appeals to a Conservative Party in shock after dumping
its leader.
   ``Against everybody's wishes in the party we've got ourselves
into a mess,'' said Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. ``We can only
get ourselves out of the mess by rallying everybody, by healing the
wounds.''
   Hurd, 60, and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, 47, joined
the race on Thursday, both hoping to block ex-Defense Secretary
Michael Heseltine.
   Heseltine's strong solo challenge to Mrs. Thatcher in a
first-round vote this week precipitated her dramatic resignation
Thursday. That opened the way for Cabinet ministers to run in the
next ballot among the 372 Conservative legislators in the House of
Commons.
   While the contenders battled for her job, Mrs. Thatcher remained
at her 10 Downing Street office. Messages of support and good will
poured in from the world's leaders, her aides said.
   ``She's very well; she's feeling fine,'' said Conservative Party
chairman Kenneth Baker as he emerged from the building.
   President Bush telephoned on Thursday and told Mrs. Thatcher
``we love you'' in a 10-minute conversation.
   Mrs. Thatcher is considered a staunch U.S. ally whose tough
free-market policies dismantled much of Britain's welfare state and
sold off government industries.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that Mrs. Thatcher and
her husband, Denis, began arranging to remove personal belongings
from Downing Street, where she has lived for 11{ years.
   Reporters and television crews camped otside No. 10 and No. 11
Downing Street, the home of Major, the chief treasury official. He
is widely regarded as being the most right-wing of the three
candidates, and thus closest politically to Mrs. Thatcher.
   Hurd and Major argued today there was scant differences in their
views.
   Both promised ``improvements'' in an unpopular local services
tax on every adult. Heseltine has pledged what he calls a
full-scale review.
   That tax and high inflation and interest rates have hurt the
Conservatives and Mrs. Thatcher's government. In addition, Mrs.
Thatcher's long tenure, her combative attitude on Europe and what
critics called her dictatorial manner alienated some close Cabinet
colleagues.
   In a first round of balloting for the party leadership post on
Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher needed to beat Heseltine by 15 percent of
the eligible voters but fell four votes short.
   This precipitated the second round of balloting, scheduled for
next Tuesday. If no winner emerges on a simple majority, a third
and final round is scheduled for Nov. 29.
   A prime asset for Heseltine has been a series of polls showing
that the Tories' 16-month lag behind the Labor Party in ratings
would narrow, or even disappear, with him as party leader.
   Mrs. Thatcher resigned after Cabinet ministers and her campaign
manager told her in private interviews Wednesday that she would
lose to Heseltine in the second round, where a simple majority is
required.
   The Independent reported today that a tearful Mrs. Thatcher told
the Cabinet she had been forced out despite her three general
election victories and widespread support among Conservative Party
members outside the Commons.
   The London newspaper said the strong-willed Mrs. Thatcher, once
dubbed the ``Iron Lady'' by the Soviets, was reported to have added
wryly: ``It's a funny old world.''
   Despite the domestic drama, the Cabinet also decided to send
14,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf, bringing the British forces
there to 30,000.
   In a bravura performance in the House of Commons Thursday
afternoon, Mrs. Thatcher defended her government's record and led a
nearly unanimous Conservative Party in defeating a Labor Party
no-confidence motion aimed at her government.
   Outside Downing Street, 250 left-wing demonstrators sang, danced
and chanted anti-Thatcher slogans as her limousine swept past on
Thursday night. Police reported 13 arrests.
   Mrs. Thatcher's son, Mark, told reporters at Downing Street
today that he felt no bitterness.
   ``I think it's very wrong to criticize the system which got us
elected 15 years ago just because it did not produce the result we
wanted,'' he said.
   Rebellion against Mrs. Thatcher had been building for years, but
news she had walked away from a fight surprised the world.
   She was Britain's first woman prime minister, Europe's
longest-serving prime minister in this century and the only one to
win three consecutive elections.

<TEXT>
   Premier Andrei Lukanov today defeated a
no-confidence motion pressed by political opponents seeking to oust
his Socialist government.
   The opposition won 159 votes for the motion in a secret ballot
in the 400-seat Grand National Assembly, but 201 deputies voted
with Lukanov.
   The vote came a day after lawmakers approved Lukanov's austerity
budget in a vote boycotted by the opposition. Lukanov had
threatened to resign if the budget failed.
   The Socialists, the former Communists, won June elections, have
210 seats in Parliament.
   Prior to the vote, Lukanov defended himself against charges by
the opposition that his government was ineffective in implementing
reforms.
   There have been growing demands for Lukanov's resignation. On
Thursday, about 50,000 people demonstrated outside the Parliament
building.
   Alexander Yordanov of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces
called Thursday for a new government, and said his group was
prepared to take over if necessary.
   The inability of the government to improve the rapidly
deteriorating economic situation and supplies of scarce foodstuffs
and consumer goods has fired anger among the country's frustrated
citizens.
   Opposition eaders claim they would triumph in new elections,
and that Bulgaria would win greater international support under an
opposition-led government.
   But Lukanov told the house that international support ``does not
depend on the color of the government.''
   The premier, who returned to Sofia Thursday from a 34-nation
Paris summit, said recent international contacts let him see that
no one would help a country ``in which there is no stability, in
which the reforms are not decisively implemented.''
   The opposition has repeatedly rejected Lukanov's requests to
join a broad Socialist-led coalition government, insisting instead
on naming the premier and holding key ministries.

   Government troops backed by helicopter
gunships raided a Tamil rebel camp in the northern jungles today,
killing at least 75 guerrillas, military officials said.
   In another area of the north, troops killed 26 rebels in two
operations, a Defense Ministry statement said. It said three
soldiers were killed and 31 injured.
   The claims could not be independently confirmed. There was no
immediate response from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
rebel group that is fighting to set up an independent nation in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   The military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the 75 guerrillas were killed in Mankulam, 133 miles north of
Colombo, in a counterattack after rebels ambushed and killed four
soldiers.
   Residents of Vavuniya, 25 miles south of Mankulam, said they
heard a series of explosions after seeing aircraft and helicopters
flying overhead.
   The residents said they saw many wounded soldiers being
transferred to ambulances from helicopters that landed in Vavuniya.
They were contacted by telephone and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The military officials did not mention any government casualties
in the counterattack.
   The Defense Ministry statement said the other two battles
occurred near Telippalai and Kaduwan, both in the rebel stronghold
of the Jaffna Peninsula, 185 miles north of Colombo.
   The statement said 23 rebels and three soldiers were killed in
Telippali and three militants were killed in Kaduwan. It did not
give details.
   Tamil separatists began their campaign in 1983, complaining of
discrimination in jobs, education and the use of Sinhala language
by the government.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people
and control the government and the military. Tamils comprise 18
percent and Moslems account for 7 percent.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old
insurgency.

<HEAD>U.N. Members Try To Revive Cambodian Peace Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's warring factions remained far apart
today as diplomats held talks to revive a United Nations peace plan
aimed at holding free elections in the nation.
   ``The sole difficulty at this point comes from the Cambodians
themselves,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said as representatives
of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members met behind
closed doors.
   They were joined by representatives of Indonesia and U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar for two days of talks.
   The stalled peace plan envisions putting Cambodia under U.N.
administration while elections can be organized. It would be the
first time for the United Nations to fully administer a country.
   Cambodia would be guided during this period by a Supreme
National Council of six representatives of the Phnom Penh
government and six from the three-faction guerrilla resistance
coalition.
   The plan is deadlocked, however, over who will lead the council.
The resistance groups back former ruler Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
The government wants Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   Sihanouk, the coalition's nominal leader, arrived in Paris on
Wednesday for what he called a private visit ahead of the talks.
The U.N. Security Council members participating are the United
States, Soviet Union, France, Britain and China.
   It is Sihanouk's first visit to Paris since September 1989, when
an international conference on Cambodia collapsed over his refusal
to spurn the brutal Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla faction in
the resistence.
   Sihanouk lunched Thursday with former Cambodian prime minister
Son Sann. The two men lead the other guerrilla factions fighting
Hun Sen's Vietnamese-installed government.
   Son Sann announced late Thursday that he would try to end the
current impasse by giving up his claim for a seat as vice chairman
on the Supreme National Council ``to set a good example.''
   The Cambodian war began when Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and
drove the Khmer Rouge from power. The Khmer Rouge had ruled for
three years, during which hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died.
   Vietnam withdrew troops last year and has been cooperating in
the peace talks.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
decided to veto construction of the Two Forks Dam in Colorado, the
largest non-federal water project in the West, it was reported
today.
   The Washington Post said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly is
expected within a few days to announce a decision to block the
billion-dollar dam, which the city of Denver had sought to increase
water supplies for its suburbs.
   But EPA officials said today that while action will be taken
soon on a review board's recommendation that no dam be built at the
site, no decision has yet been made.
   The officials, who commented on condition they not be identified
by name, said Riley will not make the decision himself but has
delegated it to LaJuana S. Wilcher, the EPA's assistant
administrator for water.
   One official confirmed that Ms. Wilcher is ``working on a
document'' but added: ``Until it is final it is inappropriate to
tell you what's in it.''
   The dam has been the focus of an intense battle between
environmentalists and supporters of increased development.
   The proposed project called for flooding much of Cheesman
Canyon, a wilderness area between two forks of the South Platte
River.
   The Post said it obtained a draft of the decision, which said
the dam would lead to ``unacceptable adverse effects,'' including
loss and damage to fisheries and recreational opportunities.
   Denver has ``practicable, less environmentally damaging
alternatives'' to provide water for the new suburbs in the front
range of the Rocky Mountains, Reilly is quoted as saying.
   Monte Pascoe, a Denver Water Board commissioner, told The Post
the decision is ``unbelievably shortsighted. You're saying squeeze
more out of the existing system and get right up to a drought
before you recognize the problem.''
   The Army Corps of Engineers in March 1989 approved a permit to
build the dam, and former Reagan administration officials had
indicated support for the project.

   Former President Reagan thanked British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies
backed down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads
off into the sunset.
   ``Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner
of the greatest personal integrity,'' Reagan said in a statement
after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.
   ``I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support,
and her loyal friendship,'' Reagan said.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by
Michael Heseltine, who resigned as her defense minister in 1986.
   Reagan and the prime minister dubbed the Iron Lady formed a
formidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutual
regard. They often stood side-by-side at international gatherings
and called each other Ronnie and Margaret.
   Two years ago, as they met for the final time before Reagan left
office, the president said he was leaving the White House with
``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher
will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
   Reagan, who spent Thanksgiving with friends at his Bel-Air home,
called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a
``selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best
interests of her country.''
   The former chief executive was always grateful to Mrs.
Thatcher's support of his conservative approach to foreign affairs
during his own eight-year tenure.
   In 1986, when the U.S. bombing of Libya was criticized by world
powers, Mrs. Thatcher was the only ally who supported Reagan and
allowed the bombers to fly from British bases.
   When Britain fought Argentina for the Falkland Islands, the
United States was forced to choose between two allies. Reagan sided
with Mrs. Thatcher.
   She also encouraged Reagan's nurturing of the huge Pentagon
buildup, and backed U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles
in Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies.
   Both leaders adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union, but
were quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as
the Cold War thawed.
   Reagan credited Mrs. Thatcher's ``resoluteness'' for playing a
key role in ending the tensions between the Western democracies and
the Eastern Block.
   ``She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meant
business,'' he said.
   Both were ardent advocates of the free market and private
enterprise.
   While the United States became mired in debt in the era of
Reaganomics, the British economy thrived on Mrs. Thatcher's radical
policies during her nearly 12-year rule. Average earnings were up
by nearly one-third and more Britons owned their homes during her
tenor.
   Like Reagan, however, Mrs. Thatcher was accused by liberals of
widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country, and both
clashed with organized labor.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker is
winding up a trip to the Persian Gulf region after failing to win
Yemeni support for a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force
against Iraq.
   Yemen, the only Arab nation on the 15-member council, was
disinclined to sign anything that might cause a military clash in
the region.
   With Baker at his side Thursday, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh criticized the presence of foreign troops in the region and
warned that if war breaks out, ``there will be no winner.''
   Baker acknowledged that the two governments differ on the best
way to achieve a political solution.
   Yemen has abstained from voting on five of the 10 Security
Council resolutions against Iraq since Aug. 2.
   Baker plans to meet Saturday with senior officials in Colombia,
which is a member of the Security Council. That body would have to
approve a measure giving advance authorization to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   He will leave Bogota on Saturday for Los Angeles, where he will
hold talks with Malaysian officials. Since leaving Washington last
week, Baker has met with foreign ministers of nine nations on the
council. Colombia and Malaysia will be Nos. 10 and 11.
   Cuba also has abstained from some votes and cast a ``no'' ballot
on one.
   Yemen's place on the council takes on increased importance
because it will assume the group's chairmanship in December, taking
over from the United States.
   The Bush administration would like to get the resolution through
the council by the end of the month, just a week away.
   French President Francois Mitterrand predicted Wednesday that a
use-of-force statement would be adopted by mid-December.
   Baker joined President Bush in Paris earlier in the week at a
34-nation East-West conference. While there, he talked at length
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Afterward, Shevardnadze said it was time to return to the
Security Council to ``take stock of things.''
   He said resolutions approved so far have not achieved their
purpose of getting Iraq out of Kuwait. However, he did not
specifically endorse a use-of-force resolution.
   On Thursday, Soviet envoy Alexander Belonogov told the United
Arab Emirates news agency that the Kremlin would like the council
to set a deadline for an Iraqi pullout, without raising the
military option.
   Since leaving Washington, Baker has met with the foreign
ministers of the following council members: Ethiopia, the Ivory
Coast, Zaire, Romania, Finland, the Soviet Union, Britain, France
and Yemen.
   He previously conferred with officials from China and Canada.
   The only two council members he hasn't met with personally are
Cuba and Malaysia. Efforts to meet with Malaysian officials while
in the Gulf didn't work out.
   The United States, France, the Soviet Union, Britain and China
are permanent members of the council empowered to veto resolutions.
   Baker will return to the United States late Saturday.

<HEAD>Israeli Government To Repair Roof Of Church Of The Nativity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel said Friday it would repair a leaky roof
at the Church of the Nativity, built at the site where tradition
says Jesus was born, because feuding Christian sects can't agree on
who is responsible for upkeep.
   Repairs at the church in the occupied West Bank town of
Bethlehem will begin in a few days and should be completed by
Christmas, said Shmuel Hamburger, a military government official.
   ``The roof is in such bad shape that the last time we had rain
two weeks ago, it was pouring inside the church,'' he said.
   He said there were gaping holes in the wood-and-tar roof. Last
Christmas, buckets for rainwater were set out inside the basilica.
   The dispute stems from the intense rivalry between Christian
sects over custody of the holy sites.
   Rights of worship and maintenance are spelled out in minute
detail in a set of rules dating back to the 1850s. However,
jurisdiction over the roof of the Church of the Nativity is not
specifically mentioned in the rules.
   In the past, area authorities - the Ottomans, the British, the
Jordanians and finally the Israelis - fixed the roof periodically
to prevent squabbles among the sects.
   But this year, the Greek Orthodox Church insisted on fixing the
roof, saying it traditionally cleaned the roof and therefore should
be allowed to do the repairs. The rival Armenian and Roman Catholic
churches protested, saying the roof should be fixed by all three
groups - or not at all.
   The Israelis stepped in several months ago with an offer to do
the repairs, but the Armenians and Roman Catholics asked that the
work be postponed.
   The offer came at a time when the Christian communities in
Jerusalem were incensed that the government supported Jewish
settlers trying to take over Greek Orthodox Church property near
the Church of the Holy Sepulcher where tradition says Jesus was
buried.
   Hamburger said that since then, the Armenians and Roman
Catholics have changed their minds. ``Now they want us to repair
the roof,'' he said.
   He said he has not contacted Greek Orthodox church officials in
the past few months, and didn't know whether they also had a change
of heart. However, Hamburger said Israel had a right to carry out
the repairs even if the Greek Orthodox opposed it.
   But the Greek Orthodox appeared insistent that they should have
custody of the roof. Twice in the past week, Greek Orthodox sneaked
onto the roof to start repairs. Both efforts drew protests from the
other sects, and the army intervened.
   Bishop Palladios, who answered the phone at the Greek Orthodox
Patriarchate in Jerusalem, said he could not comment on the case.
He referred all calls to the patriarch, who is visiting Athens. The
patriarch could not be reached for comment in Greece.
   The Church of the Nativity, on Bethlehem's Manger Square, was
built by Constantine in the year 330 and restored and enlarged in
the sixth century by Byzantine Emperor Justinian.
   The structure, believed to be the oldest Christian church in
continuous use, was erected over a grotto believed to be the site
where Jesus was born.

   The national legislature today asked its chairman

   Acting on a package of proposals, the lawmakers also endorsed
for a second time inh a week President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposed restructuring of the government. It called on the Soviet
leader to act quickly to improve food supplies.
   The lawmakers asked Gorbachev to act within two weeks to assure
that there will be enough food this winter. In the past month, he
has been touring Western Europe in search of foreign food aid, and
he has received several offers.
   The resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the nation's
economic and political affairs. ``The situation in the country
continues to worsen and is approaching a crisis condition,'' it
said.
   Another resolution passed recommended that Gorbachev take all
steps ``authorized by law, up to extraordinary measures'' in cases
where there is a threat to human life, health or property.
   That measure removed a requirement for the president to consult
with leaders of the republics before taking such measures and gave
the KGB responsibility for dealing with what it called ``economic
sabotage.''
   In a 10-minute speech, Gorbachev told the 542-member legislature
that ``every day is precious'' and urged them to move swiftly
toward a new union treaty to replace a 1924 accord uniting the
republics.
   The legislature voted to ask its chairman, Anatoly Lukyanov, to
urgently begin negotiations with the leaders of the parliaments in
the 15 republics for a temporary series of agreements to keep the
country together.
   Legislative work on a union treaty is going slowly and the
country's republics increasingly are disregarding Kremlin
authority. The resolution said provisional agreements with the
republics would help stabilize the ``social and economic situation
in the country.''
   So far, each republic has acted independently in introducing
reforms to switch to a free market economy. All but one of the
country's republics have declared sovereignty from the Kremlin.
   The result has been what many call a ``paralysis of power'' that
has hindered any reform and caused a breakdown of the country's
political and economic life.
   The Supreme Soviet said in its resolution that agreements should
be reached with the republics to stop legal contradictions. In
their drives for sovereignty or outright independence, the
republics have passed laws that ignore or even contradict national
legislation.
   Some politicians have suggested a temporary moratorium on
republican legislation that contradicts national laws.
   Gorbachev's main political rival, Russian Federation President
Boris N. Yeltsin, has urged the republics not to wait for approval
of a new union treaty and to create their own economic structure.
   Russia, the biggest republic, has signed four bilateral treaties
with other republics that bypass the Kremlin and govern trade,
cultural and political ties.
   In his speech, Gorbachev appeared to take a swipe at Yeltsin.
   Gorbachev warned the lawmakers that ``there are forces that
don't want to normalize the situation.''
   He blasted people who criticize his reforms as an attempt at
``dictatorship, an attempt to go for the jugular ... to take
advantage of the situation.'' Opponents, he said, really want to
``let the paralysis of power continue.''
   Gorbachev's proposals to restructure the government are aimed at
ridding the power structure of officials resistant to radical
reform and bringing in representatives of the republics.
   Today's resolution also endorsed Gorbachev's proposal to
eliminate the Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, and make
another body the highest state organ. That proposal has a number of
other legislative hurdles before it becomes law.
   The lawmakers told the president today to submit more concrete
definitions of what each new government body would do within two
weeks.
   Under the outline, the Council of Ministers would be replaced by
several bodies under direct presidential control. The principal
ruling body would be the Federation Council, grouping
representatives of the republics.
   Many of Gorbachev's proposals will require constitutional
amendments, which must be adopted by the Supreme Soviet's parent
body, the Congress of People's Deputies.

   Hundreds of foreign tourists angered
by a long flight delay staged an hourlong sit-in on an airport
tarmac, an airport official said Friday.
   A Garuda Indonesia Boeing 747 carrying 300 tourists was unable
to proceed Wednesday because of engine trouble after refueling at
the Polinia airport in Medan, North Sumtra. The jumbo jet had been
en route from Bali to Abu Dhabi.
   The tourists had to spend the night in the airport lounge
because all hotels in the North Sumatra capital were booked, the
airport official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   By Thursday afternoon the tourists walked to the tarmac and sat
down, threatening to block flights unless the airline could
immediately arrange their flight or provide suitable
accommodations, he said.
   The tourists ended their protest when the airline provided a new
plane, the official said.
   A Garuda official refused to comment beyond saying: ``We regret
that incident.''

   Police have recovered a tiny 2,100-year-old piece
of bronze inscribed with edicts from both emperors of the
short-lived Qin Dynasty, an official report said Friday.
   The bronze piece was used as a counterweight when weighing other
objects. It is 4 inches long and weighs nearly 3 pounds, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   It is inscribed with edicts from Emperors Qin Shihuang and Qin
Ershi on unifying the system of weights and measures.
   Xinhua said the counterweight was found in August 1989 among
scrap materials purchased by a shop in the western city of Xian.
Shop assistant Zhang Yulong took it home and showed it to a relics
smuggler, Wang Tianyin.
   Later, he discovered it was missing and told police, Xinhua
said. Police recovered it Nov. 11 in the southern coastal city of
Guangzhou, also known as Canton, when a man named Li Shiyong tried
to smuggle it out of China, the report said.
   Li also was trying to smuggle out more than 8,600 ancient coins,
it said.
   Xinhua said Wang stole the bronze weight and sold it to Li for
about $3,270, but did not say how much experts estimated it was
worth. Archeologists have declared it a first-class national
treasure.

   An Arab couple out for a moonlit walk got in

   The couple, both residents of Arab east Jerusalem, were walking

adjacent garden, the Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth said.
   The garden turned out to be on the grounds of the Israeli

   The two, in their late twenties, were released after police
questioning determined their intentions were romantic and not
revolutionary, the newspaper said. Their names were not made

   Several retired people have added to their
pension by selling sleeping pills and other state-subsidized
medicines on the drug market, police said.
   ``Mind you, this is not the average retired person doing this
... the people involved are those who have had problems with drugs
themselves,'' said Thor Carsten Pedersen, a senior police official
in Kristiansand, a town in southern Norway.
   ``They have sold sleeping pills and tranquilizers ... the
sleeping pills at about 10 kroner ($1.70) per pill,'' Pedersen
said.
   He said one pensioner had been caught and would probably be
fined. Police had been tipped of a few others involved.
   Kristiansand, a coastal town of about 65,000 people, has in the
past decade had growing problems with heavy drugs, including
heroin.
   Prescribed medicines are heavily subsidized in this welfare
state and retired people are big consumers.
   Pedersen said the biggest problem in Kristiansand was not
pensioners selling medicines in the street, but doctors prescribing
too many sleeping pills and tranquilizers to young people with
problems.

<TEXT>
   An Army Reserves helicopter on a night
training mission crashed into Lake Ellsworth and five crew members
were pulled to safety aboard a fishing boat. A sixth was missing,
authorities said today.
   The pilot, who was among the survivors, was wearing night
goggles for an over-water training exercise when the UH-1
helicopter crashed Thursday night, said Fort Sill spokesman Maj.
Chuck Pope.
   ``The news is good about the five,'' Pope said early today. ``We
don't know about the sixth.''
   ``Two have a bit of hypothermia, one was shaken up a bit and the
other two are fine,'' he said.
   Divers in wet suits searched the southwestern Oklahoma lake this
morning for the missing soldier. A helicopter like the one that
crashed was parked on the lake shore so the divers could study it
before taking to the murky water.
   Comanche County Undersheriff John Stowe said the helicopter was
in about 15 feet of water. Authorities thought the missing crewman
might be inside the helicopter, Stowe said.
   The use of night vision goggles, which electronically enhance
moonlight, has come under fire in recent years because some pilots
say they limit peripheral vision and cause other problems. The Army
says it has improved the goggles after they were blamed for a 1988
crash at Fort Campbell, Ky., that killed 17 soldiers.
   The helicopter was part of 374th Air Ambulance Company based in
Little Rock, Ark., Pope said. The lake is about 15 miles north of
the Army post.
   The medical evacuation company had been activated for Operation
Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf and had arrived at Fort Sill
earlier this month.
   After lake residents rescued the five crew members, authorities
later ordered all boats out of the water so helicopters using
searchlights could fly low to look for the missing crew member.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   Shoreline residents reported hearing an explosion before the
crash. Barbara and Kevin McCray went outside to investigate.
   ``We could hear them moaning in the water,'' said McCray, who
joined a neighbor on his boat to rescue the five crew members.
   ``If one of those guys hadn't had a little blue beacon light, we
wouldn't have found them,'' McCray said. ``There were pieces of
helicopter scattered all over the water.
   ``The five were wrapped around the rotor and they said one
hadn't come up,'' he said.
   ``First I started to panic,'' Spec. Mike Pierce said later,
wrapped in a blanket in a shoreside home. ``Then I thought, `Stay
calm,' and I reached for my seat belt and floated out.''

   As Barbara Bush looked on, girls in billowy
pink and blue pants gyrated to Arabic music. Others, wearing fancy
leotards, demonstrated aerobics. A serious little boy read poetry
in Arabic.
   While their husbands conferred about the Persian Gulf crisis,
Mrs. Bush and her Egyptian counterpart, Suzanne Mubarak, toured a
children's library.
   The children had several questions for the American first lady.
   Why did she marry George Bush?
   ``Because he's the nicest, friendliest, funniest, warmest,
wisest person I've ever known,'' she said.
   How does she feel as wife of the president of the United States?
   ``I feel very, very lucky. Sometimes I feel a little bit of a
burden. There is so much to do, and you don't have the time.
Sometimes you want to do better.''
   What are you going to ask for from Santa Claus?
   ``I'm going to ask Santa Claus for peace. How about that?''
   The kids applauded and cheered.
   That was as near to politics as the questions came, although
Mrs. Bush's 9-year-old guide, Sherif Hashem, told a reporter he had
wanted to ask her about the resignation of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. A teacher advised him not to, he said.
   Later, a reporter did the job for Sherif. The resigned British
leader will be missed, Mrs. Bush said, ``but that's not the end of
our friendship with Mrs. Thatcher. We'll see her again and again -
she's a friend.''
   Mrs. Bush said she was proud of the U.S. troops deployed in
Saudi Arabia and that she was glad to have shared Thanksgiving with
them.
   Mrs. Bush, wearing khaki slacks and a camouflage jacket,
traveled with the president to two military encampments in the
Saudi desert and to a U.S. warship off the Persian Gulf coast. She
ate turkey with the troops and promised some she would call their
relatives.
   ``My husband and I both felt very moved by those wonderful young
men and women. I, like everybody else, hope that this will end
peacefully,'' she said.
   The children waved little American flags, distributed by the
U.S. Embassy, and posed for a souvenir photo with Mrs. Bush and
Mrs. Mubarak. Mrs. Bush was given a tapestry made by one of the
children.
   Security was heavy at the library, and at the Egyptian Museum,
which Mrs. Bush also visited. The museum, which houses 100,000
artifacts from 5,000 years of Egyptian civilization, was closed to
the public all morning, and American security men with an
explosive-sniffing dog meticulously examined press equipment.
   Egyptian intelligence personnel stood watch in the museum
corridors.
   The glass-encased mummy of Pharaoh Ramses II, usually covered
with a blue cloth to protect it from camera flashes, was uncovered
for the occasion. One of the most delicate of the ancient Egyptian
relics, Ramses II's mummy, traveled to France in 1976 for treatment
against decay.
   ``He's well now,'' Mrs. Bush said as Zahi Hawass, director of
antiquities at the Pyramids area, related the mummy's history to
the first ladies.

<TEXT>
   A rare form of the AIDS virus could slip into the
nation's blood supply, but officials at the federal Centers for
Disease Control said Friday that it wasn't worth the cost to try to
detect it.
   Only 18 known cases of the virus, known as HIV-2, exist in the
United States. Tests for the more common AIDS virus, HIV-1, will
usually - but not always - detect the rarer strain, predominantly
found in West Africa.
   A CDC study of more than 25,000 blood samples detected no blood
donors with HIV-2 infection. It would cost more than $60 million a
year to test every blood donor for HIV-2, and the CDC concluded
that it wasn't worth it.
   Dr. Lyle Peterson, an epidemiologist at the Atlanta-based CDC
who led the study, said researchers chose 25,000 blood samples from
the American Red Cross and New York Blood Center, which provide
more than 50 percent of the nation's blood supply.
   Currently, blood centers conduct two tests for HIV-1: an enzyme
immuniassay (EIA) and Western blot. Positive results from one test
mean the blood is not transfused.
   Peterson said researchers have discovered that HIV-2 carriers
are likely to test positive on the EIA and negative on the Western
blot. So the study only used EIA-positive samples. But when these
high-risk samples were tested solely for HIV-2, that strain of the
virus did not appear.
   ``These (samples) represent over 12 million donations, so we're
pretty confident there isn't any HIV-2'' in the blood supply,
Peterson said. ``Generally, 60 to 90 percent of the time, HIV-2
(carriers) will have a positive HIV-1 test.''
   The CDC believes there is only one HIV-2 carrier to have donated
blood in the United States. The woman, who was not identified, had
traveled to West Africa and donated blood in 1986 before the HIV-2
surveillance project began.
   But because her blood tested positive for HIV-1, it was not
transfused.
   The CDC has biographical information on 15 of the 18 HIV-2
infected people in the United States. All of those either had
immigrated from or traveled to West Africa recently or had had
sexual contact with West Africans.
   Because of the HIV-2 risk, people who have moved to the United
States from West Africa since 1977 are excluded from donating
blood, and officials routinely question potential donors about
their contact with West Africans.
   Peterson said the CDC is continuing the study and will report to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would decide whether
HIV-2 tests become necessary.

   Two members of the Puerto Rican singing group
Menudo were arrested after an airport drug-sniffing dog detected
marijuana in their pants, and a spokesman for the group's record
company said both were fired today.
   Oscar Llord, general manager for Sonotone Music, the group's
Miami record company, said the group's manager had fired the two
singers hours after their arrest.
   Sergio Gonzalez, 18, and a 16-year-old member of the group,
whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, were arrested
Thursday evening at Miami International Airport, Metro-Dade police
Lt. James Kaelin said.
   The group was on a stopover en route from Mexico City to
Venezuela when a U.S. Customs Service dog smelled the marijuana,
Kaelin said. Customs agents took small amounts of the drug from the
two, who were charged with possession of marijuana, he said.
   ``I guess some people call them personal-use amounts, but drugs
are drugs, no matter what amounts they are,'' said Customs
spokesman Joe Krokos.
   Gonzalez was released on a $1,000 bond Thursday night, officials
said.
   Though the reason is different this time, firing of Menudo
members is in itself nothing new. They are routinely replaced as
they get too old to appeal to their pre-teen and teen audience.
   Menudo loosely translates as ``pocket money'' or ``small
change.''
   Members were active in Nancy Reagan's anti-drug ``Just Say No''
campaign. The group has been highly successful in the
Spanish-speaking world, performing before sold-out stadiums
throughout Latin America.

<HEAD>`Medical Miranda' Warning Gives Patients Legal Options</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of America's hospitals and nursing homes
are welcoming a new medical ``Miranda warning'' that gives patients
their legal options for refusing or accepting treatment if they are
incapacitated.
   ``If the issue is dealt with up front, it certainly makes things
easier when crisis situations occur,'' said Janet Riley, a
spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association, which
represents 10,000 nursing homes.
   The legislation was tucked away in the deficit-cutting package
approved in the congressional rush to adjourn and quietly became
law with President Bush's signature earlier this month.
   It stemmed, in part, from the Missouri case of Nancy Cruzan, a
woman who has been in a coma-like state since a 1983 car accident.
   The Supreme Court, in its first right-to-die ruling, rejected a
request by Ms. Cruzan's parents to remove a tube sustaining her
with food and water. The court said the Cruzans didn't have ``clear
and convincing'' evidence that their daughter would want to be
allowed to die.
   Advocates hope the law will help families avoid lengthy lawsuits
to end unwanted, life-prolonging treatment.
   The law, effective in November 1991, applies to hospitals,
hospices, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations and other
health care facilities that receive money from Medicare and
Medicaid programs.
   It will, supporters say, help inform patients of their medical
care rights much in the same way police advise people of their
legal rights in criminal matters through a ``Miranda warning'' at
the time of arrest.
   ``For the first time, adult patients will be provided with the
knowledge of their legal rights to make decisions about their
care,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   Under the law, patients must receive written information
explaining their right-to-die options under their state laws.
   For example, a person checking into a hospital would be told
about ``advance directives'' such as a living will, which spells
out a person's wishes for treatment. Another possibility is a
durable power of attorney, which designates someone else to make
medical decisions if an individual is unable to do so.
   Hospitals and other providers must note on medical records
whether patients have legal directives on treatment. Providers also
must have procedures to ensure they comply with a patient's wishes
in accordance with state law.
   The law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
conduct a nationwide campaign to educate people about right-to-die
legal options.
   ``The most important aspect of the law in my mind is not
necessarily what it's requiring hospitals to do ... but that there
is a public educational effort,'' said Frederick J. Entin, general
counsel for the American Hospital Association.
   Danforth, who introduced the legislation with Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has complained ``the health care and
legal systems do a terrible job of telling patients about care in
hopeless situations.''
   But Thomas Marzen, general counsel for the National Legal Center
for the Medically Dependent and Disabled, was critical of the
legislation.
   ``It could become a program of persuasion for a lot of people to
decline medical treatment, even if it's not particularly burdensome
and might be necessary,'' he said.
   The law, particularly for the disabled, could act as ``another
nail in the coffin - trying to get them, because they are deemed to
have a low quality of life, not to live,'' Marzen said.
   Advocates say the law creates no new federal rights.
   ``This isn't a bill that says you must refuse treatment'' said
Fenella Rouse, executive director of the Society for the Right To
Die-Concern for Dying. ``It is a bill that says you're free to make
your own choices.''

<HEAD>Hurd Says Security Council to Meet Next Week on Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS background; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today that the
U.N. Security Council may meet next week to consider a draft
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq in the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Hurd met earlier this week on the sidelines of an international
summit in Paris with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III to
discuss the proposed resolution, which would authorize an attack to
drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   The United States lobbied extensively with its allies to garner
support for the resolution and maintain the international coalition
that has formed against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Several leaders speculated in Paris that the meeting at the
United Nations would take place in December. But Hurd's comments
were the first indication that enough support had been gathered to
call the meeting as early as the end of this month.
   The United States holds the chairmanship of the council, but it
is rotated and passes to Yemen in December. Yemen, the only Arab
nation on the council, has refused to endorse the proposed
resolution.
   The United States has led the campaign to win international
support, and Baker visited Yemen on Thursday.
   Both sides said no decision had been reached. But President Gen.
Ali Abdullah Saleh, standing next to Baker, criticized the military
buildup in the region and called for an Arab solution to the
crisis.
   In Cairo today, President Bush told reporters ``the world is
getting tired'' of Iraq's continuing occupation of Kuwait and said
he was closing in on an agreement for the proposed resolution.
   Speaking at the launching of his campaign for leader of
Britain's Conservative Party and prime minister, Hurd said the gulf
crisis ``weighs on my mind among the issues more heavily than
anything else at the present time.''
   Hurd said he hoped that passage of the proposed resolution would
be ``the latest of the peaceful pressures on Saddam Hussein to get
him to withdraw.''
   ``I don't know whether those peaceful pressures will work - and
that is why I fear the crisis is entering a crucial, critical phase
and in the next weeks and months we will be in that phase,'' he
said.

   A ``human bomb'' attack,

   No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday night's
failed attack but a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabular said
the Irish Republican Army was suspected.
   The RUC spokesman said armed, masked men kidnapped a man from
his home near Newtown Butler and ordered him to drive a truck
containing a 3,500-pound bomb to an army checkpoint at
Annaghmartin.
   The gang tied up the man's elderly parents and locked them in a
bathroom while the man was driven near the checkpoint, 56 miles
southwest of Belfast. The man was told to deliver the bomb, which
they said had a five-minute timer, police said.
   The man drove the red pickup to the checkpoint, jumped out and
shouted a warning. A short time later there was a small explosion,
which was believed to have been caused by the detonator going off,
police said.
   Army bomb experts defused the bomb, one of the largest ever
found in Northern Ireland, police said.
   The army said there was only minimal damage and no one was
injured.
   On Oct. 24, the IRA staged three human bomb attacks which killed
six soldiers and a civilian, who drove one of the bombs to the army
targets.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule.

   The number of pine trees
in Yosemite Park damaged by ozone has increased more than five-fold
in the last five years, according to a new study.
   The report, released this week, says 29.7 percent of Yosemite's
pines now show mottling caused by damage from ozone, a colorless,
odorless gas produced by auto and industrial emissions. A similar
study in 1985 found 5.7 percent of the trees had suffered damage,
the National Park Service reported.
   Officials at Yosemite, which celebrated its 100th birthday as a
national park Oct. 1, said they need to study the 1990 findings
before they can comment on ways to alleviate the problem. But a
decade-old master plan for the park in the central Sierra Nevada
calls for eventually abolishing vehicle traffic by tourists into
Yosemite Valley, their prime destination.
   No timetable has been announced for the plan to force tourists
to switch to trams or buses and leave their cars above Yosemite
Valley.
   But National Park Service Director James Ridenour has promised
that park maintenance facilities will be moved out of the valley,
perhaps starting as early as the 1992 fiscal year.
   The effects of ozone in the Sierra Nevada first were noticed in
the 1970s at Sequoia National Park, 100 miles south of Yosemite and
less than 150 miles north of Los Angeles. The Park Service has
commissioned research to determine if ozone affects giant sequoias
as it does pine trees.
   Diane Ewell, Sequoia's air quality specialist, says officials
may start a system to warn visitors when the park's ozone is high,
much like the alerts in smogbound cities such as Los Angeles.

   Confederate money and weapons were nearly
worthless when Sherman attacked Atlanta in 1864. But time and
television have been kind to the Confederacy, which is now a hot
spot in the memorabilia market.
   ``We won out anyway,'' said Dent Myers, owner of Wildman's Civil
War Surplus in Kennesaw and a descendant of a rebel soldier. ``All
the Confederate stuff is worth more now than Union stuff.''
   Prompted in part by the Public Broadcasting Service documentary
``The Civil War,'' more and more people are out to buy souvenirs,
and demand is creating ever higher prices for authentic objects.
   ``There's been an unbelievable increase in sales,'' said Lori
Nash, an employee at Stone Mountain Relics. ``Everybody says, `I
want a gun like in that movie.'''
   In some cases, collectors are paying up to $4,000 for rifles and
as much as $2,000 for certain Confederate belt buckles. Musket
balls and bullets, however, are still the cheapest items, sometimes
going for as little as $2 each.
   By comparison, John Marcinkowski spent $24,000 for a one-ton
piece of history that rests in his father's basement.
   ``It just makes me happy,'' Marcinkowski, a Vietnam veteran who
lives in Marietta, said of his recent purchase of a Pennsylvania
cannon. ``A lot of people don't know their history.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he was close to getting U.N.
authorization to use force against Iraq, and Britain's foreign
secretary said the Security Council might meet next week to
consider the matter.
   The United States, meanwhile, made an ``urgent'' appeal today to
its NATO allies to help ship and fly additional U.S. troops and
equipment to the gulf region.
   Iraq announced today it was calling up army reservists. A
defense communique read on Baghdad radio said reservists born in
1958, 1959 and 1960 would have three days to report for duty.
   The callup appeared to be part of a buildup of 150,000
reservists announced earlier this week. The communique did not
provide numbers for those born in the three years mentioned.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Thursday visited his troops in
Kuwait. He used the trip, his second since the invasion, as the
scene for new threats to the U.S.-led alliance. Saddam's visit to
the emirate was announced today.
   Bush met in Cairo, Egypt today with President Hosni Mubarak, who
has led Arab opposition to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He
later flew to Geneva, where he was to meet with President Hafez
Assad of Syria, who also has joined forces with the United States
in its confrontation with Saddam.
   In Cairo today, Bush told reporters ``the world is getting
tired'' of Iraq's continuing occupation of Kuwait. He said that in
his most recent round of diplomacy he was closing in on an
agreement for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the
use of miltiary might to drive Iraq out of Kuawit.
   But even without it, ``we have the authority to do what we have
to do,'' Bush said.
   Mubarak reiterated Egypt's wish to get Iraq out of Kuwait, but
was non-committal on the issue of using force to do so.
   Later, Britain's Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in London:
``Soon, probably next week, the Security Council will consider a
draft resolution authorizing member states to use force to bring
about the reversal of the Iraqi aggression.''
   Hurd spoke at the launching of his campaign for leader of
Britain's Conservative Party.
   Earlier this week, during an international summit in Paris, Bush
lobbied hard with its allies to garner support for the resolution
and maintain the international coalition that has formed against
Saddam.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III visited Yemen on Thursday,
trying to get the only Arab nation on the U.N. Security Council to
support the use of force against Iraq. Both sides said no decision
had been reached.
   Congressional leaders said today that Bush would have a far
better chance of getting Congress to approve the use of force in
the Persian Gulf if the United Nations first backed such a move.
   The U.S. has deployed 230,000 troops in the Persian Gulf as part
of the multinational effort against Iraq. Iraq has stationed about
430,000 troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, the Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers held talks
today on the gulf crisis. Later, the two reiterated their
opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and their demand that it
withdraw.
   Neither Qian Qichen of China nor Eduard Shevardnadze of the
Soviet Union disclosed whether they had reached agreement on the
next step to defuse the crisis. They met in the remote Chinese city
of Urumqi, near the two countries' Central Asian border.
   Saddam visited his troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq on
Thursday for the second time since his invasion, according to the
official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   ``We are not seeking war, but if war is imposed on us we will
fight in a manner that will please friends and incense the evil
blasphemers,'' he told officers, the agency said.
   On the same day Saddam visited Kuwait, Bush shared a
Thanksgiving turkey dinner with U.S. troops in the sands of the
Saudi desert and promised the soldiers that ``We are not here on
some exercise.''
   In Kuwait, Iraqi occupation authorities have lifted a curfew,
the Iraqi News Agency reported today. The report indicated the
Baghdad government wants to convey that conditions in Kuwait City
and its environs have quieted down.
   Also in Kuwait, Iraq rounded up five Britons who had been in
hiding, the British Foreign Office said today. Iraq is holding
hundreds of Westerners, many as human shields at strategic sites to
deter attack by the multinational forces.

   About 2,400 people in two cities Friday protested
enthronement ceremonies for Emperor Akihito and the government's
proposal to send members of the military overseas.
   In downtown Tokyo, 300 riot police stood guard as about 1,400
people marched on busy streets chanting ``Destroy the rituals!'' No
injuries were reported, although police said they made two arrests.
   In Osaka, almost 1,000 people performed music and danced to
protest the ceremonies.
   Opponents say the state-funded rites violate the constitution,
which mandates the separation of religion and state and defines the
emperor as a national symbol.
   Akihito's father, Hirohito, was enthroned as a living god and
was used by militarists to rally support for Japanese aggression in
World War II.
   ``Our country will repeat its history if Japanese citizens allow
the emperor's enthronement rituals,'' warned Yosuke Sugi, a leader
of the ultra-leftist Chukaku-ha group.
   The demonstrators also opposed an unsuccessful bill introduced
by the governing Liberal Democratic Party that would have allowed
the dispatch of Japan's military overseas as part of international
peacekeeping efforts.
   In a predawn ceremony Friday, Emperor Akihito observed the most
controversial rite in his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, in
which he communed with the Shinto sun goddess.
   Legend says the imperial line descended from the goddess and in
the past the rite was believed to give emperors their status as
living gods. About 30,000 police were assigned to security in Tokyo
during the ritual.
   Akihito was formally enthroned on Nov. 12.

   If you're sining the blues about the cost
of Christmas presents, be thankful your true love isn't asking for
the complete catalog of gifts in ``The Twelve Days of Christmas.''
   J. Patrick Bradley, that literal-minded chief economist at
Provident National Bank, has once again toted up the sales slip for
the items listed in the old carol, from a partridge in a pear tree
to twelve drummers drumming.
   This year's total: $15,231.72. That means the Christmas Price
Index (CPI) was up 4.34 percent from last year.
   That's a slower inflation rate than the government's Consumer
Price Index, up 6.3 percent in the same period.
   Five gold rings fell in price, from $750 to $600, and the
nursery Bradley checks every year had a half-price sale on pear
trees, just $12.48 this year.
   So who's to blame for the higher index?
   Those nine ladies dancing and ten lords-a-leaping don't come
cheap. Bradley checked with the Philadelphia Dance Company and
found a performance by the ladies would cost $2,417.90, up from
$2,084.40; ten leaping lords would run you $2,686.56, up from
$2,316.
   Eleven pipers piping cost $42.12 more this year, or $947.70; 12
drummers drumming can be had for $1,026.68, up $45.63.
   And those eight maids-a-milking are still a minimum-wage bargain
at $30.40 for an hour's work, up $3.60.
   Everything else held steady. Swans continue to be the biggest
strain on the credit-card limit at $1,000 a pop, or $7,000 for all
seven.
   ``We have been tracking these prices since 1984, as a way of
getting ourselves into the Christmas spirit,'' Bradley said. ``Many
of our clients look forward to reading about it. Plus, it shows
that we practitioners of the dismal science have a sense of
humor.''
   ---&equals;
   The complete list, with prices:
   One partridge in a pear tree, $27.48.
   (Partridge, $15; pear tree, $12.48.)
   Two turtle doves, $50.
   Three French hens, $15.
   Four calling birds, $280.
   Five gold rings, $600.
   Six geese-a-laying, $150.
   Seven swans-a-swimming, $7,000.
   Eight maids-a-milking, $30.40.
   Nine ladies dancing, $2,417.90.
   Ten lords-a-leaping, $2,686.56.
   Eleven pipers piping, $947.70.
   Twelve drummers drumming, $1,026.68.

<HEAD>New Telephone Program Will Alert Doctors to Respiratory Viral
Outbreaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Centers for Disease Control announced a new
program Friday that the agency hopes will help doctors hear about
outbreaks of potentially fatal respiratory viruses sooner.
   The CDC is monitoring respiratory syncytial (RSV) and
parainfluenza viruses - which cause a variety of often serious
respiratory ailments, especially in young children.
   Previously, health officials had alerted the CDC of outbreaks by
weekly postcards. Now, they will report the viruses by telephone,
enabling the CDC to post the results on the national Public Health
Network weekly.
   CDC epidemiologist James Alexander said the timeliness will help
doctors and public health officials hear of outbreaks sooner, thus
cutting down on the number of diagnostic tests ill children undergo
and possibly helping doctors prevent spread of the virus.
   The study shows that RSV is most often found in January. RSV
causes kinds of bronchial illnesses that can be fatal to infants or
sickly children, and it hits almost every child by age 2.
   The CDC found that the two least serious types of parainfluenza,
known as types 1 and 2 and which cause colds and croup, usually
cause outbreaks every other fall, especially in November.
   Parainfluenza type 3 is more serious and causes types of
bronchitis and pneumonia in infants and the elderly, which can be
fatal. It is found year-round but the CDC study indicates it peaks
in spring.

<HEAD>Surveys Find Budget Deficits Loom In 30 States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 30 states face budget deficits because of
the rising cost of services, falling tax revenues and slackening
consumer spending, according to surveys.
   The deficits range from $42 million in Tennessee to $1 billion
in New York, according to studies by the National Association of
State Budget Officers and The Boston Globe.
   ``It's unusual to have this many states in trouble when we're
really just going into a recession,'' said Jerry Miller, head of
the state budget group. ``The last time things were this bad, in
1982-83, we were already in a recession.''
   The surveys concluded that the faltering economy has dampened
business output, leading to a falloff in revenues from state
business taxes.
   ``Corporate taxes are the most volatile and have fallen the
greatest,'' said George Leung, head of state ratings at Moody's
Investors Service.
   Leung said consumers have been buying less, leading to a dro in
sales tax collections.
   ``Studies show consumer confidence has dropped to record lows,''
he said.
   The less consumers spend, the more businesses are likely to lay
off workers. State governments also have trimmed their payrolls,
including Massachusetts where up to 10,000 part- and full-time
state jobs have been eliminated over the past two years.
   The surveys found that job losses, by both public and private
employers, are adding to state spending, as unemployed workers sign
up for state benefits and more families join the welfare rolls.
   Such layoffs have also depressed states' third major source of
revenue: personal income taxes.
   Indications of economic hard times were papered over in some
states to shield officeholders running for re-election, said Hal
Hovey, editor of State Budget and Tax News.
   Hovey said that in Maine, for example, state officials falsely
reassured voters that depressed revenues would increase after the
election.
   Similarly, Michigan budget officials predicted spending on
Medicaid would drop, Hovey said, ``when everyone else expects it to
go up 10 to 20 percent.''
   Miller agreed that ``a number of states were not totally candid
until after the election.''
   The federal government last year began requiring states to pay
for expanded coverage for victims of catastrophic illness, nursing
home residents and pregnant women.
   ``Just the new mandates in Medicaid cost more than the total
revenue growth in a number of states, including New York, Rhode
Island and Massachusetts,'' said Miller.
   Even many states where budgets remain in balance are worried.
   ``This year we're right on target, but it's looking like we may
have slowed revenue growth so things will be pretty tight next
year,'' said John Gasparith, New Mexico's budget director.
   These are the 30 states listed by the surveys, which did not
provide complete deficit figures:
   Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
Vermont and Virginia.

   Unidentified gunmen attacked a weapons depot in
the Armenian capital of Yerevan, killing one guard and wounding
another in an ensuing gunbattle, the Tass news agency said Friday.
   According to the regional border guard commander, Thursday
night's assalt was the second attack this year on the arms and
combat hardware depot.
   ``A group of approximately five to six criminals covertly
approached the territory of the post and suddenly opened fire from
automatic weapons from three directions simultaneously,'' the news
agency quoted Gen. L. Vysotsky as saying.
   He said the depot was under the protection of border guard
troops, a division of the KGB, when the gunmen attacked.
   ``The sentries took up defensive positions and repulsed the
bandits' attempts to break through to the depot premises,''
Vysotsky said. ``When reinforcements arrived at the facility, the
attackers fled, taking with them the submachine-gun of the killed
border guard.''
   Armenia and the neighboring southern republic of Azerbaijan have
been locked in a three-year battle for control of Nagorno-Karabakh,
a predominantly Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan's borders. More
than 220 people have died in the ethnic clashes.
   Militants in both republics have carried out raids on military
installations and police stations in order to arm themselves.
   On Thursday, Tass reported that military reinforcements had been
sent to the border region between the two republics to quell four
days of ethnic-inspired shootings in which seven people were killed
and nine wounded.

Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is
trying to entice hundreds of employees to retire early to ease the
impact of a 10 percent drop in visitors this year.
   Colonial Williamsburg officials said Wednesday that early
retirement will be offered to 360 employees, about 8.6 percent of
its total work force of 4,200.
   The early retirement program will not forestall the usual
seasonal layoffs in January and February, the off-season at the
restored colonial capital of Virginia, officials said.
   The incentive was offered to management as well as unionized and
non-unionized employees. Colonial Williamsburg spokesman Albert O.
Louer said savings from the plan should be about $1 million.
   The plan was offered Nov. 13 to employees who are at least 55
years old and have at least 10 years of service with the non-profit
foundation. Eligible employees have until Dec. 19 to decide on
whether to join.
   Among the incentives for early retirement are a boost in pension
benefits, and continuation of health and life insurance until the
retiree reaches 65.
   The tourist attraction, which features craftsmen and others in
period costume portraying colonial life, had 1.17 million visitors
last year. Spokesman Jim Bradley said they expect at least 1
million visitors this year.

<TEXT>
   A teacher who started a pen pal
program with soldiers in the Persian Gulf wants his students to
brace themselves for the worst - that their new friends could die
in battle.
   ``At first it was an assignment,'' said Dan Copen, a 14-year-old
student at Valley Middle School. ``But when we got the letters
back, we're thinking, `I have a friend over there.'
   ``Now, I'll watch a good football game and think, `Ah, that is
something Barry would like to see,'' the eighth-grader said of his
pen pal, a U.S. Marine stationed in Saudi Arabia as part of
Operation Desert Shield.
   Todd Beach, a 25-year-old teacher and wrestling coach at Valley
Middle School in this Twin Cities suburbsaid he decided to put his
seventh and eighth grade students in touch with the soldiers
because he was frustrated.
   ``The kids were thinking: `Things are swell. The world is
safe,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, events in the Persian Gulf were being compared to
events preceding World War II, and Saddam Hussein was being
compared to Hitler.
   ``It wasn't hitting them,'' said Beach. ``They couldn't
comprehend or understand what a huge, huge thing this is
historically.''
   But Beach is concerned about the budding friendships.
   ``I do need to tell you some things,'' he told his classes last
week. Reports that U.S. troops are moving closer to the Kuwaiti
border suggest the possibility of military action against Iraq, he
told them.
   ``You have to realize that things are changing very quickly
there. You need to prepare yourselves,'' he said gently, ``that
there is a great possibility that the people you are writing to
might die.''
   About 150 students have written to soldiers in the Persian Gulf
and some have also written to Hussein and President Bush.
   ``In the beginning, I was 100 percent behind you in your
decision,'' Copen wrote in a letter to Bush last week. ``I did not
know anyone who was sent over there. But, just a few months ago I
started to write to a soldier named Barry. And all he talks about
is coming back home, and how afraid he is of not coming home.''

   There was a slight increase in the number of
abortions performed in the United States, the Centers for Disease
Control reported Friday.
   The CDC said 17,614 more abortions were performed in 1988 than
in the preceding year, an increase of 1.3 percent. In 1988,
1,371,285 abortions were reported and in 1987 there were 1,353,671
abortions, according to the CDC.
   But the national ratio - the number of abortions per 1,000 live
births - dropped from 356 to 352.
   The characteristics of women having abortions also remained the
same, epidemiologist Lisa Koonin said. About 92 percent of the
women were residents of the state in which the procedure was
performed. They were predominately younger than 25, white,
unmarried and had no other children.
   About half the abortions were performed in the first eight weeks
and 88 percent within the first trimester. Curettage, a suction and
scrape method, accounted for 97 percent of the abortions.

with firebombs and rocks in a demonstration Friday demanding an end
to U.S. pressure to open Korean trade and agriculture markets.
   As anger over trade issues increased, the nation's major
dissident and radical student organizations announced nationwide
protests to be held Sunday. Police said illegal protests would be
blocked and security would be tightened around U.S. facilities.
   ``I admit we have not made enough effort to remove
misunderstanding,'' Deputy Premier Lee Seung-yun told reporters
Friday.
   Lee, also the economic planning minister, said the government
would try to resolve trade dispuates with foreign governments,
especially Washington.
   He said if foreign distrust of Korean external economic policies
increase ``trade friction is bound to expand and is feared to
greatly affect the operation of our economy.''
   About 4,000 students at 16 universities in Seoul staged rallies
and battled riot police Friday to demand an end to U.S. pressure
that Korea open its markets, news reports said. An additional 400
students clashed with police in southern Kwangju city, reports
said.
   ``Drive out Yankees who force (trade) negotiations!'' yelled
about 200 students hurling firebombs and rocks at Seoul's Yonsei
University. ``Oust Roh!'' they chanted.
   At Seoul's Sogang University, 500 students clashed violently
with police for more than an hour outside the campus. Students
hurled hundreds of rocks and firebombs and police fired volleys of
choking tear gas from four black armored vans. There were no
reports of arrests or injuries.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung told lawmakers the nation would
face major unrest unless Roh halts ``suppressive rule'' using
security organizations to crackdown on dissidents, workers and
students.
   Kim also said the country should ``sternly cope with America's
unrealistic pressure to open its markets, especially farm
products.''
   It was Kim's first speech to the National Assembly since his
group, the Party for Peace and Democracy, ended a four-month
boycott and returned to the legislature on Monday.
   All 78 opposition legislators offered to resign en masse from
the 299-member parliament in July, charging the ruling party with
railroading bills and reneging on democratic reforms.
   Also on Friday, conservative Catholic bishops issued a rare
political statement demanding release of imprisoned dissidents,
including those jailed for making illegal trips to Communist North
Korea. The opposition claims there are 1,500 political prisoners, a
charge denied by the government.
   Dissident and farmers have staged violent anti-government and
anti-American protests, denouncing U.S. pressure on South Korea to
open its agricultural markets wider.
   South Korean consumer and civil groups have threatened to launch
a nationwide boycott against U.S. goods, saying anti-American
sentiment is escalating because of U.S. trade pressure.
   Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg said negative
views of America have become widespread in South Korea, threatening
to poison economic and political relations between the two
countries.

   President Bush today sought to solidify the Arab
coalition against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, getting fresh assurances
from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and then flying here to
consult with Syria's Hafez Assad.
   Assad's Syrian Arab Airlines Boing 747 touched down three hours
before Air Force One. Speaking through an interpreter, Assad told
reporters, ``We have the hope there will be between us convergent
viewpoints.''
   Bush and Assad planned two hours of talks. The session has
proved controversial because Syria is on a State Department list of
countries that sponsor terrorism.
   At a photo session with Bush before the meetin, Assad shrugged
off a question about whether Syrian forces would join any military
offense against Iraq. ``Do you think at such a large press
conference that we speak about offensive or defensive operations?''
he said.
   Bush, tight-lipped and largely unsmiling as he joined Assad,
refused to answer reporters' questions. The two leaders sat in
chairs some distance apart.
   Before leaving Cairo, Egypt, Bush declared that ``the world is
getting tired'' of Iraq's continuing occupation of Kuwait and said
he was closing in on agreement for a U.N. resolution authorizing
the use of force in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I think we're very, very close now,'' said Bush, fresh from a
Thanksgiving Day visit with U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.
   In New York, Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations Yuliy M.
Vorontsov said the U.N. Security Council will meet next week, with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attending. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III will also be in New York next week.
   Vorontsov said the meeting will discuss Iraqi aggression and to
issue a ``strong, serious and precise warning'' to Baghdad.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Friday that the
council may meet next week to consider a draft resolution
authorizing the use of force.
   Geneva was the final stop of Bush's week-long overseas journey.
It also was the site of his controversial meeting with Assad, whose
nation is on a State Department list of nations that sponsor
terrorism.
   Bush defended his decision to meet with Assad, whom he said ``is
lined up with us for a commitment to force.''
   He said the international coalition demanding Iraq's withdrawal
from Kuwait ``will not rest'' until Saddam pulls his forces out.
``So-called partial solutions are out of the question,'' he said.
   Mubarak's declarations sounded identical. ``The Iraqi invasion
must be reversed and Kuwait must be liberated,'' the Egyptian
leader said. ``For both of us it's a matter of principles and moral
courage.''
   At the same time, Mubarak used the news conference to call for
an overall settlement to intractable Arab-Israeli disagreements. He
urged a greater international effort to deal with the ``plight of
the Palestinian people.'' He added. ``The holy shrines of Jerusalem
must be respected and protected.''
   Bush said the United States is eager for an overall Middle
Eastern peace agreement. But, he swiftly added, ``What I am equally
determined to do is to keep these two questions separate. There is
no linkage'' to the Kuwaiti occupation, he said.
   The United States currently has an estimated 230,000 troops in
the Persian Gulf region, and another 200,000 or more are on their
way.
   Bush spoke with reporters as congressional leaders returning
from Saudi Arabia said the president would have a far better chance
of getting House and Senate support for the use of force if the
United Nations first backed such a move.
   ``It would have some significant impact if the United Nations
granted such a resolution,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said a U.N. resolution would
improve Bush's chances but not necessarily guarantee congressional
approval if the president sought it.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole said he would urge Congress to
reconvene immediately if the United Nations endorsed force to free
Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. ``Then I would hope Congress would
reconvene and take similar action,'' Dole said.
   Bush's authority has been challenged by 45 House Democrats who
filed a suit in federal court earlier this month seeking to bar him
from ordering an attack without congressional approval.
   Bush, whose voyage took him to a 34-nation European summit
conference as well as to the Middle East, is mounting an energetic
diplomatic campaign to round up support for a U.N. Security Council
resolution permitting the use of force to dislodge Saddam's army
from Kuwait.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III traveled to Yemen on
Thursday as part of that effort, but was rebuffed. Yemen sits on
the Security Council and will take over the rotating chairmanship
from the United States at the end of the month. Baker is headed for
Colombia on Saturday for additional meetings with another Security
Council member.
   Bush, when asked about the status of a U.N. resolution, said he
believes he has the authority necessary to act without United
Nations concurrence. He added, however, ``I am confident that we
will be successful in the Security Council. The world is getting
tired of this, and the Security Council is tired of the fact'' that
earlier resolutions have been ignored.
   ``But we're going to keep working on it and I think we're very,
very close now,'' he said.
   Bush also defended his decision to meet with Syria's president,
brushing aside a question of whether he was rewarding terrorism by
meeting with the leader of a nation that is on the State Department
roster of nations that sponsor terrorism.
   ``They're on the front line'' of standing up to Saddam, Bush
said. He quickly added, ``that doesn't mean we have no differences
with Syria,'' and said he would be discussing those subjects with
Assad. ``Mr. Assad is lined up with us for a commitment to force,''
Bush said.
   Bush's day trip to three continents - he was ending up at Camp
David, Md. - marked the end of an overseas journey that seemed to
span two eras. He began his trip in Europe, where he participated
in signing ceremonies for a treaty to cut conventional forces in
Europe and attended a conference that symbolically buried the Cold
War.
   The emotional highpoint of the trip was the holiday spent
visiting U.S. and British forces in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We won't pull punches,'' Bush promised troops in Saudi Arabia.
   Bush was in high spirits Thursday after hop-scotching by
helicopter across eastern Saudi Arabia to spend Thanksgiving with
troops who someday may be ordered to war to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   The president, accompanied by his wife Barbara, came within 65
miles of the border with Kuwait, stopping at an encampment for U.S.
Marines. Bush called it ``an unforgettable experience.''
   It was a scene of endless desert, marked only by clumps of
camouflage netting that concealed combat vehicles and other
equipment. Altogether, the president saw about 5,000 to 6,000 of
the 230,000 American troops in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We are not here on some exercise,'' Bush said. ``And we're not
walking away until our mission is done, until the invader is out of
Kuwait.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned today that a
breakup of the Soviet Union could lead to ``bloodshed and civil
conflict,'' and said he would use all his constitutional powers to
prevent it.
   ``We will not be able to divide. When such attempts have been
made, the results were bloodshed and grave consequences,''
Gorbachev said in a news conference.
   He spoke hours after the Supreme Soviet legislature for the
second time in a week endorsed his plans to reorganize the
presidential branch of government, and gave him two weeks to take
radical steps to boost the food supply.
   Gorbachev offered few details on his proposals to improve the
food situation, other than saying he had secured promises of
Western aid, and planned to suggest changes in laws covering
agriculture and landholding.
   He said the latest draft of a proposed Union Treaty would be
published Saturday. The treaty is designed as a new charter binding
the 15 Soviet republics. All but one of have declared some form of
sovereignty, and the three Baltic republics have declared
independence.
   Gorbachev said that those republics wishing to leave the union
must hold a referendum, as required by Soviet law, and that as
president he would oppose any other form of dissolution of the
union.
   ``If someone tried to impose such a policy, it would result in
bloodshed and civil conflict, which would be unacceptable to the
world community,'' he said.
   Asked to specify what steps he would take to prevent a republic
from leaving the union, Gorbachev said ``we will stay within the
constitution.''
   ``It is a whole divorce procedure,'' he said, referring to the
law requiring a referendum in any republic wishing to secede.
   ``In this way, it will be bloodless.''

   A welfare recipient turned banker, a self-made
millionaire and an old Etonian began the battle on Friday to
succeed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   All promised to be less combative than Mrs. Thatcher toward
Europe, just as tough toward Iraq and willing to do something about
her unpopular local services tax, heralding a five-day campaign
that seemed more about a prize than a battle over policy.
   ``We can only get ourselves out of the mess by rallying
everybody, by healing the wounds,'' said one candidate, Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major joined the race
Friday. They must stop former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine,
whose strong showing in the first round of voting Tuesday provoked
Mrs. Thatcher's resignation.
   She spent the day in her office at 10 Downing Street ``running
the country,'' her son Mark said. Mrs. Thatcher gave no hint of
which candidate she favored, although it certainly wasn't
Heseltine.
   Major, 47, left school at 16 and worked his way up from laborer
and welfare recipient to banker, and then went into politics. He is
regarded as on the right of the party and therefore closest
politically to Mrs. Thatcher.
   Hurd, 60, was educated at the upper-class preparatory school
Eton and Oxford and generally more liberal in Tory terms.
   Heseltine, 57, also Oxford-educated, is a self-made millionaire
who resigned from the Cabinet in 1986 after a sharp disagreement
with Mrs. Thatcher about the sale of a British defense contractor.
   Mrs. Thatcher decided to quit Thursday after Cabinet ministers
and her campaign manager told her she would lose to Heseltine in
the second ballot next Tuesday.
   The vote among the 372 Conservative members of Parliament will
go to a third and final ballot next Thursday if no one gets a
simple majority of 187 or more on Tuesday.
   Hurd and Major pledged at their campaign kickoffs to review the
nation' so-called poll tax, an unpopular per capita local
government tax imposed regardless of income and regarded as a major
political blunder of the Thatcher era.
   ``I do become increasingly convinced that we cannot leave things
as they are,'' Major said.
   Heseltine declared that an immediate and fundamental review of
the tax ``is essential for our survival.''
   Hurd and Major, who support Mrs. Thatcher's rejection of a
single currency for the European Community, each promised - in the
closest to open criticism of her so far - to adopt a markedly
different tone in Europe and in Cabinet meetings.
   ``I think that Cabinet government consists of listening,
deciding, persuading (voters) in that order,'' Hurd said. ``You
listen to views, you take a decision - in our case collectively in
Cabinet.''
   Hurd maintained he'd be the best prime minister for the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been the most enthusiastic Western supporter
of the U.S. troop buildup in the region. Her Cabinet decided
Wednesday to send 14,000 more troops to the gulf, bringing the
British total to 30,000.
   ``The crisis is entering a crucial, critical phase ... and will
require cool and authoritative handling,'' Hurd said.
   On the poll tax issue, Heseltine has the advantage of having
left the Cabinet before it was imposed.
   However, he is regarded as something of a maverick who does not
fit wholly into the party's left or right, and he has stirred deep
anger among some Thatcher loyalists for bringing her down.
   ``It's not been a pleasant thing to do,'' Heseltine said. ``But
now that it has happened, the mood of unity has overwhelmed the
party.''
   David Robertson, a fellow in politics at Oxford University, said
the reluctance by Hurd, Heseltine and Major to adopt markedly
different policy platforms reflected the ``old American political
notion of a balanced ticket.''
   ``All three of the current candidates, rather than advancing
serious general ideologies, are doing their damndest to hide
them,'' Robertson said in a BBC radio interview. He predicted the
party was returning to pragmatism, ``a sort of non-ism,'' after
nearly 12 years of Thatcherism.
   Mrs. Thatcher spent part of Friday on the telephone, talking to
foreign leaders calling to say goodbye and good luck to the Western
world's longest-serving head of government.
   Her husband, Denis, and 35-year-old twins, Mark and Carol
Thatcher, spent part of the day with her.
   ``She's doing what she always does on a Friday, running the
country,'' Mark Thatcher, an auto executive who lives in Dallas,
Texas, told reporters after visiting his mother.
   Bookmakers made Major and Heseltine near-equal favorites to win.
   A Market and Opinion and Research International poll for the
Times of London suggested the Tories, who have lagged in opinion
polls for 16 months, would defeat the opposition Labor Party under
Heseltine or Major, but lose under Hurd.

<HEAD>Cocaine Found in Blood of 6 Percent of Child Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study has found that 6 percent of young
children treated at a Detroit hospital had cocaine in their
systems, fueling concern that secondhand drug smoke harms infants,
officials say.
   Dr. Norman Rosenberg, chief of emergency medical services at
Children's Hospital of Michigan, said his findings may be the first
effort to determine the rate of children's exposure to smoke from
crack, the highly addictive, smokable form of cocaine.
   ``Nothing official has ever been published,'' he said.
``Everyone I have talked to says it (evidence of exposure) is
extraordinarily high.''
   Since October 1989, evidence of cocaine exposure has been found
in the urine of about 6 percent of 360 children treated in the
hospital's emergency room. An additional 120 samples have yet to be
analyzed.
   The study includes children from 1 month to 5 years old who were
taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening ailments. None had
been breast-fed, and any cocaine from exposure in the womb would
have dissipated from their blood by the time they were 1 month old.
   Rosenberg said youngsters who tested positive had to have been
exposed to crack smoke within three days because cocaine passes
through the body within 72 hours.
   Children were excluded from the study if they had symptoms such
as seizures, hypertension and rapid pulse, which suggest they may
have eaten the drug, Rosenberg said.
   ``It's a very sad commentary for the quality of life for
children in this state,'' said C. Patrick Babcock, director of the
Michigan Department of Social Services. ``Every day, there is a new
phenomenon because crack is so widespread and such a cheap high.''
   Elizabeth Rahdert, a research psychologist at the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, said Rosenberg's results seem clinically
significant. She said the finding is disturbing because it may only
reflect the tip of the iceberg since crack addicts may be less
likely to seek medical care for their children.
   Doctors in several U.S. cities have reported that babies exposed
to crack smoke had seizures, were abnormally drowsy or couldn't
stand up.
   A 1989 study published in the American Journal of Diseases of
Children examined the cases of four children from 3 months to 4
years old in New York City's Harlem section who were heavily
exposed to crack smoke. Each had symptoms of drowsiness and
unsteady gait or seizures.

   President Bush said Friday he was confident the U.N. Security
Council would authorize the use of force against Iraq, and
Britain's foreign secretary said the council probably would meet
next week to take up the matter.
   Iraq, underscoring its readiness to fight to keep Kuwait, began
calling up battle-hardened military reservists on Friday. It also
lifted a curfew in the conquered emirate, insisting ``normal life''
is resuming - and implying that the Kuwaiti resistance has been
beaten down.
   The United States made an ``urgent'' appeal to its NATO allies
to help ferry U.S. soldiers and equipment to the Persian Gulf
region, officials said.
   There are about 230,000 American troops in the gulf region now;
200,000 more are to arrive in coming weeks.
   Word that the Security Council would convene soon to consider
the use-of-force measure came from Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign
secretary.
   ``Soon, probably next week, the Security Council will consider a
draft resolution authorizing member states to use force to bring
about the reversal of the Iraqi aggression,'' he told reporters in
London.
   Iraq overran Kuwait Aug. 2 in a dispute over land, money and
oil.
   The Soviet ambassador to the United Nations also said the
Security Council would meet next week to discuss Iraqi aggression,
but did not specify whether the resolution authorizing force would
be discussed. But the envoy, Yuliy M. Vorontsov, said Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would attend the session.
   Shevardnadze held talks Friday with his Chinese counterpart,
Qian Qichen, in the Chinese city of Urumqi. Both China and the
Soviet Union have urged Iraq to get out of Kuwait, but both have
stressed the need for a peaceful solution.
   Hurd's comment was the first indication that enough support for
the use-of-force measure had been gathered to call the meeting
before the end of the month.
   The urgency is due in large part to the fact that Yemen, which
has tilted toward Iraq in the past, takes over the rotating
chairmanship of the Security Council from the United States in
December.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was in the small Red Sea
nation on Thursday seeking support for the resolution, but failed
to get it. Yemen is the only Arab state on the Security Council.
   Baker will continue his intensive lobbying effort on the measure
during the weekend. He is to meet Saturday with senior officials in
Colombia and hold talks in Los Angeles with officials from
Malaysia. Both are Security Council members.
   Bush, too, has been working hard to build support for the
resolution. He conferred Friday in Cairo with President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, which has been a chief Arab ally in the anti-Iraq
coalition.
   Afterward, Bush said: ``I am confident that we will be
successful in the Security Council.''
   Later, Bush arrived in Geneva, Switzerland, for talks with
Syrian President Hafez Assad. Some congressional leaders have
expressed concern about the meeting because Syria is on a State
Department list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
   But Bush defended his dealings with Assad, saying the Syrian
president is ``lined up with us for a commitment to force.'' Before
the meeting, Assad declined to tell reporters whether Syria would
participate in any military offensive against Iraq.
   The U.S. pitch for help from North Atlantic Treaty Organization
members in ferrying troops to the gulf was made by NATO envoy
William H. Taft IV at the Brussels headquarters of the alliance,
officials said.
   European allies have already provided some troop-transport
assistance, but the ew request centered on the need for passenger
planes, said a U.S. official at the NATO mission, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The latest Iraqi call-up, announced in a defense ministry
communique broadcast on Baghdad radio, involves reservists in their
30s, including battle-tested veterans of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   They apparently will be among 150,000 reservists and draftees
that Iraq said earlier this week would be sent to Kuwait, along
with about 100,000 other regular army troops.
   Also Friday, Iraq's official news agency said it was canceling
an overnight curfew in Kuwait because the emirate is calmer now.
The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, CYprus, said the move was
meant to ``confirm the return of normal life'' to Kuwait, which
Iraq has declared to be an Iraqi province.
   In other developments:
   -Western European lawmakers warned in a report that the
multinational force in the gulf region risks dangerous mix-ups if
coordination is not improved. It said procedures for identifying
the nationality of warships and planes must be modified ``to assure
the safety of friendly forces.'' The report is to be discussed next
month by representatives of the West European Union, the European
arm of NATO.
   -Iraqi authorities rounded up five British men who had been in
hiding in Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion, Britain's Foreign Office
said Friday. The government estimates that 750 British citizens
remain in Iraq, about 300 of whom are being detained a key military
sites. Less than 600 Britons remain in Kuwait, about 60 of whom are
being detained.

<HEAD>Soviet Spies Continue to Operate in Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet KGB has stepped up its espionage
activities in Germany despite the new era of East-West friendship,
a spokesman for Bonn's counterintelligence agency said Friday.
   While political leaders hail the Cold War's end, Soviet spies
continue to search for German defense secrets, desperately needed
technological know-how and political information.
   ``It's cheaper to use the help of a spy agency to get the
know-how than to buy it,'' said Hans-Gert Lange, spokesman for the
German counterintelligence agency.
   About 400 Soviet spies are working in former East Berlin,
according to one leading newspaper.
   In years past, Communist East Germany employed up to 8,000 spies
to keep tabs on West Germany, and then passed on the information to
its Warsaw Pact allies in Moscow.
   That changed after the peaceful revolution in East Germany a
year ago led to the unification with NATO member West Germany.
   ``The intensification is due to the fact that they (the Soviets)
have to do more on account of the information deficit, and they are
doing it,'' Lange said.
   He is the spokesman for the Constitutional Protection Office,
the government branch in charge of fighting foreign espionage
agents
   Lange said the political upheaval that shook East Germany made
the Kremlin even more eager to get intelligence information.
   More Soviet agents are slipping into Germany, Lange said,
although he did not have a specific number of KGB spies operating
in the unified nation.
   Lange said the Soviets are trying to recruit former East German
agents.
   ``There has always been spying and there always will be
spying,'' he added.
   By law the spies should be rounded up and prosecuted, but the
Berliner Morgenpost newspaper said German authorities for the most
part are reluctant to make arrests because of the improved ties
with the Soviet Union.
   The newspaper said at least 400 KGB agents were still operating
in what used to be East Berlin. The paper said the information came
from former East German secret police agents cooperating with
German authorities since unificaiton on Oct. 3.
   German officials are hoping the Soviets will withdraw their
spies on their own initiative, the paper said.
   The Nov. 5 arrest of a KGB major in Potsdam, near Berlin, was a
``warning signal'' to the Soviets, the paper added.
   A government spokesman said Friday night he had not read the
article and therefore could not comment directly on it. But the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said spies would be
arrested if caught, ``regardless of which country'' they worked
for.

   A man wrecked his house with more than 70

   ``There were holes everywhere - totally ventilated,'' said
police Sgt. Pat Findley. ``He just said he was shooting through his
house and he couldn't see any reason why he couldn't do it.''
   Roy Koutsky, 25, was booked for investigation of reckless
shooting, said Findley. No one was injured and police never
returned his fire.
   Most of the shots were fired through the house's back wall.
   Police called to Koutsky's Hollywood home by neighbors evacuated
two houses and an adjacent apartment building and a special weapons
and tactics platoon surrounded the house, Findley said.
   After Koutsky surrendered, officers counted 73 shell casings on
the floor of the house, Findley said. Some pellets hit duplexes
behind Koutsky's house, but there was no other apparent damage to
other buildings.
   Officers confiscated a large quantity of ammunition, a shotgun,
a sword and a toy pistol, Findley said.

   At least two of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
loyal fans on Friday found it hard to let go of the woman who quit
after 11{ years in power.
   Jean Rogers and Mark Kingscote from the Torbay Conservative
Association handcuffed themselves to railings outside the home of
Michael Heseltine to protest his ``betrayal'' of their beloved Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Heseltine's challenge to Mrs. Thatcher for the Conservative
Party leadership led to her resignation on Thursday.
   Mrs. Rogers and Kingscote said he had ``stabbed her in the
back.''
   ``We have been faithful,'' said Mrs. Rogers, who described
herself as a housewife. ``We are disgusted about what has
happened.''
   Mrs. Rogers and Kingscote, 29, who works in a jeweler's shop,
also were angry with Nigel Lawson, Edward Heath, Sir Geoffrey Howe
and the Conservative members of Parliament who voted against Mrs.
Thatcher in the first round of the leadership battle.
   The couple carried a placard which read: ``Maggie made us great,
you have destroyed us.''
   They said they were part of a group of 40 faithful Thatcher
supporters who had traveled from Devon to register their anger.
   ``We would have liked Maggie to stay on,'' Mrs. Rogers said.
``The only time I thought she would leave Number 10 was in a
coffin. I feel like I am in mourning.''
   After 10 minutes, the pair freed themselves and told reporters
they were heading to Downing Street to continue their pro-Thatcher
protest.

<HEAD>Government Appears To Welcome Drug Cartel's Offer To Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Colombian judicial official
said Friday the government wanted to clear the way for drug
traffickers to surrender peacefully.
   The traffickers have proposed that hundreds of them gather to
surrender in a heavily fortified compound protected by the army.
The judicial official, Carlos Mejia, appeared to endorse the idea
in a radio interview Friday.
   ``We would guarantee the personal security of these persons, as
well as protect their legal rights, giving them decent and
dignified treatment,'' said Mejia, national director of Colombia's
Criminal Court Division.
   The drug smugglers have not said if the offer to surrender
applied to Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel's leader. Escobar,
Colombia's most wanted man, remains at large despite a government
offer to pay $500,000 for information leading to his capture, dead
or alive.
   The surrender offer came in a statement given to President Cesar
Gaviria by a group of church leaders who have been negotiating the
release of nine journalists being held hostage by the cartel. The
president's office released the statement late Thursday.
   In exchange for giving themselves up, the druglords demanded
guarantees of safety and a promise not to send them to the United
States. On Friday, the traffickers declared a unilateral cease-fire
in their terrorist attacks, their third such truce this year.
   Thursday's statement said between 200 and 300 cocaine smugglers
would be willing to surrender in a compound protected by the army
and police.
   The statement did not mention the fate of the journalists. But
the Medellin cartel issued a communique Friday saying the
journalists ``will be released as long as our human rights and
those of our families are respected.''
   Earlier, the cartel said it kidnapped the journalists because
police were torturing and killing trafficking suspects in Medellin,
Colombia's second-largest city.
   In Friday's statement, the cartel said it was declaring a
cease-fire so that ``the people can go to the polls freely'' in a
national election next month. Voters will elect a national assembly
to reform the country's constitution.
   The Medellin cartel has been blamed for killing about 550
Colombians since the government and traffickers declared war on
each other after a political assassination in August 1989. The
traffickers' offer to surrender raised hopes that the drug war
would end soon.
   Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo on Thursday outlined guarantees
for cocaine smugglers who surrender. In a letter to the Criminal
Court Division, he said traffickers would be kept in clean,
well-guarded facilities.
   Giraldo said surrendering traffickers ``can be sure they will
not be extradited.''
   Many of the cartel's killings have been to protest extraditions
to the United States. In statements to the media, the cartel refers
to itself as ``The Extraditables.''
   In September, Gaviria had offered to ban extraditions and reduce
jail sentences of cocaine traffickers who surrendered and
confessed.
   The traffickers said they would expect, upon surrendering, that
their treatment be monitored by international human rights
organizations. In Thursday's statement, they said they do not
deserve to be treated like common criminals.

   Two counselors who set out to ``get revenge''
against two autistic men after a scuffle were accused of beating
and burning them with cigarettes, police said.
   ``It's pathetic when you think that people who are put in charge
of these people would assault them in any way,'' said Detective
Michael Fiori.
   Arrest warrants were issued Wednesday for Charles Blakney, 26,
and Marvin Hill, 33, for investigation of the burning and beatings.
On Friday, the two Denver men had not been arrested, Fiori said.
   Blakney and Hill were counselors for the Denver Board for the
Developmentally Disabled and make up part of the victims'
round-the-clock care.
   On Oct. 3, Fiori said, a 32-year-old autistic man became
distraught and began destroying his apartment, which he shares with
the other victim. At some point in the disturbance, he slapped a
counselor with an open hand.
   ``That's what caused the counselor to decide he was going to get
revenge,'' Fiori said.
   A day and a half later, the counselors allegedly assaulted him,
Fiori said.
   One of the assailants told another counselor that ``they hit him
about the stomach and chest area so as not to show any bruises,''
Fiori said.
   ``One victim was also burned with a cigarette on his forearm,''
Fiori said. ``This had been confirmed by a doctor. There was one
other client out there who was also burned with a cigarette on his
stomach.''
   Blakney and Hill, who are black, were placed on leave when the
assaults came to light in late October. They have since filed
complaints with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Fiori said. The complaints say the move to place
them on leave was racially motivated, he said.
   Neither victim is able to help in the prosecution. But there was
a witness to one of the assaults and evidence in both cases, Fiori
said.
   ``I don't have any comment on the personnel issue,'' said Gene
Van Blaricom, acting executive director of the board.
   Because of confidentiality laws, he said, he was unable to
comment on the discrimination complaint.

<DATELINE>SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An artist's sales of inexpensive
jewelry in the shape of houses have raised nearly $300,000 to
benefit the homeless in 38 states.
   The jewelry designed by Lucinda L. Yates is available from
retail stores and non-profit groups. Under an agreement with her,
all of the outlets donate 40 percent of the $10 price to community
shelters.
   Ms. Yates, who previously created high-fashion jewelry, said she
devised the idea for house pins after failing to find volunteer
work in the community.
   ``I wanted to get involved in some capacity, other than working
in a soup kitchen. And here I was offering my services but I was
getting little or no response,'' she said.
   The colorful cardboard brooches caught the imagination of local
residents. And when the president of the Women's Council of
Realtors in Portland took some of the pins to its national
convention in Florida, sales started to spread to other states.
   The business gained wider attention when other national groups,
including foundations and a college sorority, joined the cause.
   ``When I wear a house pin, I get stopped by people in the
streets, wanting to know where I got it,'' said Sister Eileen
Reilly of St. Mary's Catholic Church in Richmond, Va.
   So far, 80,000 pins - each one slightly different - have been
sold. In the past three weeks, the company Ms. Yates created to
manufacture the brooches has been getting 1,000 new orders a day,
she said.
   Ms. Yates, her family and several friends make the pins at her
South Portland office. She also employs several home-based workers
for a total work force of 25 people.
   The 35-year-old Portland native said she is just as surprised as
anyone at the popularity of her pins.
   ``Pretty soon we'll have to have 18-wheelers come in here to
pick up all the orders,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Germany on Friday rejected U.S. claims that
the Soviet Union has sufficient food supplies this year, and said
it will send experts to Moscow next week to try to resolve
distribution problems.
   There have been dire predictions of what the winter holds in
store for the Soviet people and fears that food shortages could
worsen long-standing tensions and lead to widespread civil unrest.
   In a meeting with reporters Friday, government spokesman Dieter
Vogel underscored Bonn's view that food shipments and other aid to
Moscow this year were absolutely essential.
   ``According to our knowledge, delivery of foodstuffs is
unfortunately necessary, because although there was an average, a
reasonably good harvest in the Soviet Union, the logistics there
contain so many complications that the supply is obviously
insufficient,'' Vogel said.
   U.S. officials in Washington say there is no evidence of
widespread hunger in the Soviet Union, one of the world's biggest
grain growers, and that a food aid program shouldn't be necessary
this year.
   ``Clearly, it's mostly a political consideration, not a
nutritional or an economic consideration,'' one U.S. source said on
condition of anonymity. ``The Germans offering food aid put some
pressure on the rest of us to show the same kind of concern, but
it's exasperating because it's their (the Soviets') problem to
solve, and they're not taking the necessary steps.''
   Vogel noted that the Soviets have always said their biggest
problem was getting the goods to their people.
   Hundreds of German trains bound for the Soviet Union are stuck
at the German-Polish and Polish-Soviet borders because the Soviets
are unable to unload the goods and ship them to their destination.
   A team of German foreign ministry, economic, agricultural and
transportation officials, under the leadership of Horst Teltschick,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top aide, will be in Moscow on Tuesday and
Wednesday for talks on the matter, Vogel said.
   Kohl told Parliament the group would meet with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials.
   Bonn has already promised $19.5 billion in various forms of aid
to the Soviet Union. Berliners have said they want to send
stockpiles they kept during the Cold War, in the event of a Soviet
invasion, to help their former enemies.
   Vogel said the delegation would discuss the Berlin stockpiles,
but that how much could be sent would be left to the Bonn
ministries to decide.
   Kohl has made help for the Soviet Union a major theme in recent
speeches and meetings with world leaders, particularly at this
week's 34-nation summit on security in Europe. His argument is that
only with a stable Soviet Union can the old East bloc continue with
its reforms.

   Thousands of soldiers who had planned to
retire or leave the service at the end of their enlistments will be
forced to stay in uniform, the Army said today.
   The troops may be needed for Operation Desert Shield, the Army
said.
   The Army also said it was freezing all transfers of soldiers
from overseas to bases in the United States, and that all training
centers and military schools will be kept open during the customary
two-week Christmas vacation period.
   The Army-wide halt to releasing officers and enlisted men and
woman personnel was approved today by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney. Details were to be announced later.
   The combination of measures is designed to keep the Army at the
highest possible state of readiness in case additional
reinforcements are needed in the Persian Gulf crisis, officials
said.
   Also today, the Marine Corps disclosed that it invoked a measure
on Nov. 8 that means as many as 12,000 Marines, both regular and
reserve, could be prevented from leaving the service even though
they were due to retire or finish serving their obligations.
   On Aug. 22 President Bush gave Cheney authority to retain
members of the armed forces on duty in the gulf who reach their
retirement or re-enlistment dates.

<HEAD>Homeland Military Leader Says South Africa Backed Coup Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The military leader of the
Transkei black homeland on Friday accused the South African
government of backing a coup attempt by rebel troops that left 18
people dead.
   Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa told a news conference that the
government allowed rebels to use South African territory to mount
the attack. He said the coup bid ``vindicates accusations that
South Africa destabilizes government that it does not like.''
   The South African government denied any involvement in the
failed coup.
   Holomisa's troops Friday displayed in Umtata the bodies of rebel
leader Lt. Col. Craig Duli and 10 other insurgents killed in the
fighting. Seven loyalist soldiers were killed, officials said.
   Holomisa denied reports that Duli had been executed after he was
captured. He said the rebel leader was wounded in the fighting and
died on the way to the hospital.
   Witnesses said Duli was carried alive but wounded from a
government building and put in the trunk of a car after spectators
tried to attack him.
   Holomisa also denied South African press reports that five
whites involved in the coup attempt had been arrested.
   According to various reports from Transkei, rebels firing
mortars attacked an army base on the outskirts of Umtata early
Thursday, but were driven off by loyal troops.
   The rebels then headed for the center of the city and holed up
in Holomisa's office in the main government building.
   Press reports said the airport in Umtata came under heavy mortar
fire and that terrified civilians tried to flee the city. Telephone
lines were cut after the initial attacks.
   Duli helped Holomisa seize power in a bloodless coup on Dec. 30,
1987, that ousted Prime Minister Stella Sigcau. At the time, Duli
was the military intelligence chief.
   Holomisa apointed him to the ruling military council that was
set up to run the homeland, but Duli resigned in April 1989 after
disagreements. He was detained shortly afterward on suspicion of
engaging in activities that threatened state security and was held
until December 1989.
   Duli was arrested again in April on charges of illegal
possession of firearms and ammunition and was sentenced to six
years in prison. He was free on bail, pending appeal, when he
launched the coup attempt.
   Transkei is one of four black homelands declared independent by
the South African government but not recognized as such by any
other nation. The South African leadership set up the homelands in
the 1970s and 1980s as part of a plan to create separate states for
blacks.
   The mostly rural homeland, the birthplace of ANC leader Nelson
Mandela, is made up of three separate land blocks in the southeast
of South Africa and has about 2.75 million residents. It accepted
independence in 1976.

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Rembert Weakland,
censured by the Vatican for studying women's reasons for having
abortions, said Friday his critics won't silence his views.
   ``I can't imagine (being stopped) unless you take out my
tongue,'' he told reporters as he broke into laughter at a news
conference marking his return from a trip to El Salvador. ``I must
admit I may be too upbeat about it. Maybe that's not good.''
   When asked about the Vatican's decision last month to bar a
Swiss university from giving him an honorary doctorate, he said:
``I haven't taken it that seriously,''
   The Vatican's Congregation of Education in October ordered the
University of Fribourg to remove Weakland's name from a list of
recipients for honorary degrees scheduled to be awarded this week.
   The university had sought to honor Weakland for his work in
writing a 1986 U.S. bishops' letter on the economy and social
justice. After the Vatican's order, it canceled the awards ceremony
rather than exclude Weakland.
   In the letter to Fribourg, the Vatican accused Weakland of
``causing confusion among the faithful of the United States''
concerning abortion.
   Weakland has maintained he respects the church's opposition to
abortion but believes church leaders need to better examine the
reasons why women, including Catholics, risk sin to obtain
abortions.
   He held six meetings this year with women in his archdiocese to
discuss the question, then issued a letter that criticized some
tactics of anti-abortion protesters as demeaning and lacking
compassion.
   The same letter also suggested that some people who describe
themselves as ``pro-choice'' may not necessarily advocate abortion
and their views needed to be reconciled with those of the church.
   Weakland said he considered the Vatican's censure confusing and
has written a letter asking for clarification.
   ``Everybody's shrugging their shoulders wondering what's going
on,'' he said.
   Weakland said church leaders have warned that his views ``are
not without theological implications'' but he doesn't plan to
change his outspoken approach to the issue after the censure.
   ``It won't change my procedure, I'm sure, in dealing with any
topic. I'm not concerned about that,'' he said.
   He added that the loss of the award was insignificant when
compared to the insight he gained from discussing abortion with
women.

<TEXT>
   The embattled government of former
Communists survived a no-confidence vote on Friday, but the
opposition kept up the pressure by declaring a boycott in
Parliament.
   Petar Beron, leader of the opposition Union of Democratic
Forces, said his parliamentary faction was ``temporarily
interrupting its participation in Parliament'' and consulting with
voters.
   Meanwhile, the nation's largest union expressed disgust with
both the government and opposition. It said it would circulate a
petition among its hundreds of thousands of members expressing no
confidence in lawmakers.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov had tied his political fate to the
parliamentary no-confidence vote. It came after months of wrangling
between his Socialists and the opposition on how to turn around the
moribund economy and end Bulgaria's political paralysis.
   The no-confidence motion was defeated 201-159 in secret
balloting in the 400-seat Grand National Assembly. It came a day
after lawmakers approved Lukanov's austerity budget in a vote
boycotted by the opposition. Lukanov had threatened to resign if
the budget had failed to pass.
   Krastyu Petkov, head of the independent labor federation,
appealed to President Zhelyu Zhelev to call new elections. He told
state television a non-politial government of experts should run
the country in the interim.
   A smaller trade union has called a general strike starting
Monday if Lukanov does not step down before then. But the general
prosecutor issued a statement Friday warning that strikes based
solely on political demands were not permitted.
   Prior to the vote, Lukanov defended himself against charges by
the opposition that his government was ineffective, and called for
``dialogue and honest compromise.''
   The Socialists, formerly the Communist Party, won June elections
and have 210 of the 400 seats in parliament. But because some of
those seats are held by renegades, Lukanov has not been able to
count on a majority.
   Scarce supplies of food and consumer goods have fired anger
among Bulgaria's frustrated citizens about the economic crisis and
the political deadlock.
   Opposition leaders claim they would triumph in new elections,
and that Bulgaria would win more international aid under an
opposition-led government than one of former Communists. But
Lukanov said international aid ``does not depend on the color of
the government.''
   The premier, who returned to Sofia on Thursday from a 34-nation
Paris summit, said talks with other leaders convinced him no one
would help a country ``in which there is no stability, in which the
reforms are not decisively implemented.''
   The opposition has repeatedly rejected Lukanov's requests to
join a broad Socialist-led coalition government, insisting instead
on naming the premier and holding key ministries.

   About 500 miners in hard hats and overalls
staged a noisy demonstration in front of parliament Friday
demanding increased government subsidies for financially troubled
coal mines.
   A petition handed to the Sejm, or lower parliament house, said a
cut in subsidies under the government's radical economic reforms
has made mines unprofitable and caused a drop in living standards
for miners, the state PAP news agency reported.
   During the 1{-hour protest, the miners also demanded wage talks
with the government, PAP said.
   A 31-year-old miner, Ryszard Chojnowski, collapsed during the
demonstration and later died, PAP reported. The cause of death was
being investigated, it said.
   Miners in a series of warning strikes have been demanding basic
pay of twice the national average of 1.2 million zlotys a month,
equivalent to $130.
   Traditionally, miners commanded much higher wages than other
workers because of the strategic importance of their industry and
the difficult, dangerous working conditions.
   But Poland's post-Communist, Solidarity-led government has said
mining should be transformed into a profit-making industry. Huge
government subsidies are slowly being cut, while coal prices are
being allowed to rise.
   Many of the miners demonstrating Friday were from the
Communist-founded OPZZ trade union federation. Leaders met with
Mieczyslaw Gil, head of the Citizens Parliamentary caucus, which is
allied to the Solidarity labor movement; Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski; and various deputies.
   ``We are leaving hopeful, although we have not solved the
question,'' said Rajmund Moric, head of the OPZZ mining union,
after the demonstration. He said representatives of parliament and
the government would visit the mining region of Silesia on Dec. 1.

   Santa Claus walked a picket line Friday
after a company that provides Santas was fired by mall managers
because an elf allegedly made a suggestive comment to a store
employee.
   Bernard Zolnowsky, president and ``head Santa Claus'' of Old
Style Music Inc., said he and several other workers dressed as
Santa, Mrs. Claus and elves decided to picket the Seneca Mall to
show the public the mall ``is playing Scrooge'' by firing them at
the start of the season.
   ``They said the elf on Saturday had made a comment to a store
employee that he wanted to molest her body,'' said Zolnowsky. He
refused to identify the man hired as an elf.
   Lawrence Rose, manager of the mall just south of Buffalo, told
the Santa company Sunday he wanted the elf fired, said Zolnowsky,
who is threatening to sue Seneca Mall for breach of contract.
   ``They said, point blank, if you don't fire the elf, we'll
terminate your contract,'' he said.
   Rose said the mall's attorneys told him not to comment on any
allegations concerning the elf. But he said that wasn't the reason
Old Style's contract was invalidated and said the contract says
management needs no reason to cancel the contract.
   ``We terminated the contract on the basis of the general quality
in the operation of the Santa Claus operation,'' said Rose. ``We
did not feel this was up to our standards.''
   Zolnowsky said that when he first heard about the allegation
``there was steam coming out of my ears. My first idea was to fire
this person.'' But he said the elf convinced him that he didn't say

   Zolnowsky said the mall management refused to give him any proof
of the allegation or a affidavit containing the store employee's
claim.
   Old Style will remain at the mall until its contract ends at the
end of the month, said Zolnowsky.
   Rose said the sight of Santa picketing has hurt not only his
mall but the image of Santa Claus.
   ``Santa Claus is a revered institution,'' he said. ``And when
somebody plays with it in a negative way, people reject it.''

   Iraq on Friday canceled a night curfew in
Kuwait to convey that Kuwait is calmer now, but also began calling
army reservists in their 30s to join troops facing multinational
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   A Defense Department communique broadcast on Baghdad radio did
not say how many reservists fell into the age group specified -
those born from 1958-60 - but it would include battle-hardened
veterans of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   They apparently will be part of a callup of 150,000 reserves and
draftees that Iraq said this week would be sent to occupied emirate
along with about 100,000 regular army troops.
   The curfew announcement, reported by the official Iraqi News
Agency and monitored in Nicosia, followed a two-day trip by
President Saddam Hussein to Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   INA said lifting the 11 p.m.-7 a.m. curfew ``was taken to
confirm the return of normal life to the governate.''
   Following its blitz invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iran declared
Kuwait Iraq's 19th province, or governate.
   Refugees from Kuwait reported an active, though diminishing
resistance struggle there.
   Saddam inspected Kuwait on Thursday and told the troops he would
fight to ``inflict defeat and disappointment ... on the evil
blasphemers'' in event of a U.S.-led offensive.
   The visit came as President Bush spent Thanksgiving in Saudi
Arabia with some of the 230,000 U.S. servicemen so far deployed in
Operation Desert Shield. U.S. troops make up most of the
multinational army opposing Iraq.
   ``After getting acquainted with conditions of the citizens in
the province of Basra, the president (Saddam) paid a visit to the
4th and 2nd Army Corps and the command of the Republican Guard
forces,'' INA said.
   The 4th and 2nd Corps are usually based in the central sector of
the border with Iran. They were apparently redeployed to reinforce
troops in the south in August after Saddam suddenly acceded to
Iran's peace demands for a final end to their eight-year war.
   The Republican Guards are an elite corps of 120,000 men who
spearheaded the invasion of Kuwait. At least six divisions are
deployed south of Basra as a strategic reserve for Iraqi forces
occupying Kuwait.
   Iraq now has about 430,000 troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Bush has ordered the U.S. force in the region increased by an
additional 200,000 troops, mainly armored units based in Germany,
by mid-January.
   That will bolster the U.S. and allied forces in the region to
around 550,000 personnel and give the multinational force an
offensive capability.
   The force originally was deployed to defend Saudi Arabia and its
oilfields.
   Iraq's army has seven corps totaling 55 divisions, including
555,000 regular troops and 480,000 reserves.
   Saddam had to abandon plans to form 10 new divisions, with up to
as many as 150,000 men, because of a manpower shortage. Iraq has a
population of 16 million, including about 1.5 million men aged
18-32.

<HEAD>Four Fishermen Missing After Submarine Pulls Down Boat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four fishermen were missing and feared dead Friday
after a British nuclear submarine snagged their trawler's fishing
gear and dragged the boat under water.
   ``The search for the crew continues,'' Defense Minister Archie
Hamilton told the House of Commons. ``But, sadly, it now seems
extremely unlikely that they will be found alive.''
   Hamilton said the Royal Navy and the Transportation Department
will investigate how the submarine HMS Trenchant caught the boat's
fishing gear and pulled it under Thursday in the Firth of Clyde off
southwestern Scotland.
   A naval vessel's underwater video equipment discovered the
wreckage of the 52-foot trawler Antares early Friday 390 feet below
the surface, said coast guard spokesman Roger Clarke.
   He said the land and sea search for the fishermen was centered
on the Isle of Arran.
   Fishermen and friends of the missing men said submarine
activities in the Firth of Clyde should be suspended.
   ``Quite a few people are getting angrier and angrier,'' said the
Rev. Alastair Dunlop, a minister in Carradale, the trawler's home
port. ``Everybody finds it hard to believe that a modern submarine
does not know there's a fishing boat above it.''
   Hamilton said the Royal Navy had operated submarines in the
Firth of Clyde area for more than 80 years ``with an excellent
safety record.''
   ``This incident was a tragedy, but it seems to have been a very
freak accident,'' he said.
   Clarke said no one was concerned about the incident until the
fishing boat did not return to port later Thursday. Searchers then
spotted an oil slick and the wreckage, he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Friday he and President
Bush agreed the U.N. Security Council should be convened soon to
discuss the Persian Gulf, and said higher ranking officials than
U.N. representatives may attend.
   The Soviet president denied reports he and Bush disagreed when
they met Monday night in Paris.
   ``I can tell you that meeting I had with President Bush only
reinforced our cooperation,'' he told a news conference.
   ``We need to find a common solution,'' Gorbachev said, repeating
his call for the Security Council to meet in the near-future.
   ``Once we have the Security Council in session, I am sure that
it will be able to adopt a course that would be adequate to meet
the requirements of the situaion.
   ``I am not sure whether it is going to be a resolution or any
other formal document.
   ``I don't think that it would be on the permanent representative
level. ... We might perhaps give some thought to having another
level for that Security Council meeting, which we would approach
with full seriousness.''
   He did not specify who might attend from the Soviet side.
   Gorbachev rejected speculation that he and Bush differed on
their approach to the crisis, which began with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``The analysis that we made with President Bush showed that we
have to continue to act within the framework of the U.N. Security
Council so that we can tell the aggressor to comply with the
demands of the Security Council.''
   He said that some news media reports pointed to ``cracks between
the two countries'' because the two leaders ``decided not to have a
press conference, and this gave rise to reports of some divisions
between us'' Monday night.
   Instead, said Gorbachev, he and Bush agreed ``the situation is
fraught with grave consequences, larger than those that we had in
Afghanistan or Vietnam.''
   ``This is something very serious, and that is why we must
cooperate here on the basis of a joint approach that we developed.
We maintain systematic contacts so that we continue to control the
situation,'' he said.
   ``Therefore, as a result of our frank analysis and exchange of
views ... we concluded that time made it essential for the Security
Council to be convened and to consider the situation. No one can
speak for the Security Council, irrespective of the role played by
the two countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, they
still have to act together with the United Nations,'' he said.
   In Cairo, Egypt, on Friday, Bush said he was very close to
getting U.N. approval for using force to try to oust Iraq from
Kuwait.

<HEAD>Contact Lens Injury Interrupts Billy Idol European Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock singer Billy Idol, on a comeback tour
after a serious motorcycle accident, was briefly sidelined in
Europe by a contact lens injury.
   Idol, in the second week of his ``Charmed Life'' European tour,
canceled four shows after his corneas were lacerated by grit that
got under his lenses, spokeswoman Sharon Chevin said Friday in
London.
   The injury occurred during an outdoor show in Oslo, Norway, on
Saturday, said another spokeswoman, Sarah McMullin, in Houston.
Idol has a home in Los Angeles.
   The painful injury forced Idol to cancel concerts earlier this
week in Gothenberg, Sweden; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Brussels,
Belgium, his spokeswomen said.
   He planned to perform as scheduled Friday night in Frankfurt,
Germany, Chevin said. To protect his eyes from damage under the
bright stage lights, Idol was to wear sunglasses, with a patch over
his more badly injured right eye.
   The Brussels concert has been rescheduled for Saturday, and Idol
intended to try to reset the other canceled shows, Chevin said. The
European tour started Nov. 14 in Helsinki, Finland.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Friday that
a break-up of the Soviet Union could lead to ``bloodshed'' and
``civil conflict,'' and said he will use all his constitutional
powers to prevent it.
   ``We will not be able to divide, and when such attempts have
been made, the results were bloodshed and grave consequences,''
Gorbachev said in a wide-ranging news conference.
   He spoke shortly after the Supreme Soviet legislature endorsed
his general plans to reorganize the executive branch of government,
and gave him two weeks to take steps to alleviate shortages in the
nation's food supply.
   The legislature also passed a ``state of the union'' resolution
asking its chairman, Anatoly Lukyanov, to begin urgent negotiations
with his counterparts in the 15 Soviet republics for agreements to
stop the political disintegration of the country.
   The resolution expressed serious concern about the collapse of
central authority, and recommended Gorbachev take all steps
``authorized by law, up to extraordinary measures'' in cases where
there is a ``threat to human life, health or property.''
   It seeks to end a national paralysis of power resulting from the
republics acting independently in introducing reforms to switch
from a centrally planned to a market economy.
   All the Soviet republics except Kirgizia have declared some form
of sovereignty, and the three Baltic republics have declared
independence.
   It was the second time in a week the Supreme Soviet endorsed
Gorbachev's proposal to eliminate the Council of Ministers, or
Soviet Cabinet, and replace it with several bodies under direct
presidential control.
   It's unclear if the legislature will take up the Gorbachev
reform plan again.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, whose job would be eliminated
under the government realignment, was quoted by the government
newspaper Izvestia as saying he was prepared to step down if
Gorbachev's proposals are accepted.
   Ryzhkov said the proposals, announced last Saturday by
Gorbachev, caught him by surprise.
   Ryzhkov and radical lawmaker Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of
Leningrad, criticized Gorbachev's proposals as sketchy.
   ``There isn't any complete picture of the system of the
political government of the country,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Gorbachev said he respected the autonomy of the republics, but
that if any of their leaders ``try to ... act in the way of an
ultimatum, they will destabilize the situation, and make it more
difficult. And I, as the president, also have a limit.''
   Asked later whether he would use force to prevent any republic
from seceding, Gorbachev said ``we will stay within the
constitution'' in negotiating a new union treaty to serve as a
charter uniting the republics.
   Any republic wishing to leave the union, he said, must respect a
Soviet law passed this year requiring a referendum.
   ``It is a whole divorce procedure,'' he said.
   Attempts to leave the union without a referendum ``would be a
tragedy to our peoples,'' he said. ``It would lead to civil
conflict with the most grave consequences and that would bring the
country to a situation unacceptable to the world community, as
well.''
   The resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the country's
economic and political affairs. ``The situation in the country
continues to worsen and is approaching a crisis condition,'' it
said.
   The legislature also gave the KGB security police responsibility
for dealing with what it called ``economic sabotage.''
   The Supreme Soviet, in endorsing Gorbachev's plans to
``streamline the executive branch,'' removed a requirement for the
president to consult with leaders in the republics before making
the changes.
   The plan appeared designed to remove officials who are resistant
to radical reform, and bring representatives of the republics into
the central government.
   Under the outline, the Council of Ministers would be replaced by
several bodies under presidential control. The principal ruling
body would be the Federation Council, grouping representatives of
the republics.
   Gorbachev offered few details on his ideas to improve the
economy, other than saying he would propose changes in laws
covering finances, transportation, energy resources, agriculture
and landholding.
   The resolution called on Gorbachev, within the next two weeks,
to work out a program to improve the food situation and ensure
distribution of food from abroad.
   And he said that Western nations were offering food, credits and
other forms of assistance to the Soviet Union during the winter.
   His spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said this week that Gorbachev
had won promises of up to $10 billion in aid from Germany, Italy,
Canada, Spain and Britain.
   President Bush also has offered to aid the Soviet Union this
winter.

   Nelson Mandela said Friday he will
request a constitution-writing assembly and interim government at
next week's talks between his African National Congress and the
South African government.
   He told an African trade summit in Swaziland that the government
seems to be losing its resolve to enter full-scale negotiations and
is trying to weaken the ANC.
   Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk are due to meet Tuesday for
talks aimed at setting up negotiations on a new constitution to
give political power to the black majority. Both sides had said
they wanted to begin full-fledged negotiations early next year.
   However, the white-led government has recently criticized ANC
calls for increased protests and other forms of mass action against
apartheid, the South African system of racial separation and white
dominance. The two sides also have differed over the causes of
black factional fighting in townships near Johannesburg that has
killed more than 800 people since August.
   Mandela said Friday he would advocate a constituent assembly to
draw up a new constitution and an interim administration to govern
until the process is completed.
   Anti-apartheid groups have previously called for interim
leadership and an elected constituent assembly to ease South
Africa's transition to a non-racial government. The government has
rejected an interim leadership.
   However, De Klerk has pledged to eliminate apartheid and to
share political power with blacks. He asks protection of minority
rights under any new system.
   The ANC wants a non-racial system with equal voting rights for
all citizens.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites control the government,
while the 30 million blacks have no national voting rights.

   About 2,000 owners, breeders, trainers,
jockeys and stable grooms held a sit-in protest with dozens of
Arabian steeds Friday at the shell-battered race track over a
government decision to build a presidential palace there.
   The protesters who gathered at th walled midcity hippodrome
pledged to resume racing at the beginning of the new year.
   ``We shall race anew despite the government decision,'' Nabil
Freij, a leading member of the track's governing committee, told
reporters.
   ``The track has long been a prime symbol of national unity. Its
choice for a new palace ground shatters this symbol.''
   As he spoke graceful Arabians trained at the track for the first
time in two years. Hundreds of Moslem and Christian fans joined in
the applause as the horses paraded.
   The track is governed by ``the committee for preserving the
dynasty of the Arabian horse,'' which allows only Arabian steeds to
race. Throroughbreds are prohibited.
   Bulldozers were clearing the rubble of 15 years of civil war
during which the track, because of its location right on Beirut's
dividing Green Line, was caught in Christian-Moslem crossfire.
   The track, called the Palace of Peace, was closed and reopened
more than a dozen times during the civil war. The last closure was
in March 1989, during a rebellion by renegade Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Now, peace finally seems to be coming to this nation of roughly
3.5 million people.
   Of the 700 racing Arabians in the stables at the track, 400
survived shelling duels between troops loyal to Aoun and regulars
and irregulars with whom he fought intermittenty until his
rebellion was crushed on Oct. 13.
   Some horses were killed in their boxes. Many perished of hunger
and thirst when breeders and stable grooms fled.
   The heavy shellfire punched huge craters in the mile-long oval
track, wrecked sections of the galleries and left gaping holes in
the three-story headquarters of the governing committee.
   ``The loss is colossal for us, something around $5 million
within the track,'' said Freij, whose family has a breeding farm in
east Lebanon's Bekaa valley. ``And now we have this irresponsible
decision of the government.''
   On Nov. 7, President Elias Hrawi's Cabinet decided to build a
new palace and government complex for the prime minister at the
pine-wooded track.
   The old palace in suburban Baabda, a main target during the
sectarian conflict, was demolished by Syrian warplanes during the
drive against Aoun.
   Hrawi's administration has abolished the city's demarcation line
and ordered civil war irregulars to withdraw from the capital and
its environs to create a unified, militia-free ``greater Beirut.''
   ``You don't inaugurate a united greater Beirut with an act of
disunity,'' Freij said. ``That's what the decision to build the
palace on the race track amounts to.''
   The track has been one of the few places where up to 10,000
fans, rich and poor, Moslems and Christians, mixed at weekends.
   Freij inherited the racing passion from his father, the late
Marquis Moussa de Freij, who founded the track with millionaire
sportsman Henry Pharoun, now 90, about 70 years ago.
   Moslem horse owners and breeders flanked Freij, a Christian, as
he warned on Friday that closing the track would strip 2,500
families of their only source of income.
   ``I've been spending $4,000 a month for years now to keep my
trainers and stable grooms with my 33 Arabians, waiting for the day
races will resume,'' said Antoine Kashouh, a Christian. ``Will the
government feed them now?''
   Moslem trainer Mohammed Haddar said at times during the fighting
he had to buy food one day for his family and one day for the
horses he cared for.
   He complained, ``We've starved to keep the horses. We survived
the civil war, the (1982) Israeli invasion and Aoun's wars, hoping
against all odds to race again. With peace in sight now, the
government says `no.' It's not fair.''
   The track was inaugurated in 1916 under the Ottoman Empire. The
present governing committee took an 80-year lease for the grounds
in 1920, when France ruled Lebanon after World War I.

   Mongolia's Communist Party re-elected its
reform-minded chairman, but replaced most other party chiefs in its
latest leadership shakeup, China's official Xinhua News Agency
reported Friday.
   The presidium, the top body of the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party, have undergone several major changes this year
amid public pressure to adopt reforms similar to those being
introduced in the Soviet Union.
   Party chairman Gombojavyn Ochirbat was re-elected and L. Tudev,
director of the party newspaper Unen, was reported to have retained
his presidium seat.
   At a three-day session, the party's Central Committee appointed
five new presidium members ranging in age from 34 to 44, the news
agency reported. The presidium, formerly known as the Politburo,
sets basic party policy. It now has seven members.
   Four presidium members appointed in earlier shakeups stepped
down or were removed, Xinhua said. One had become ambassador to the
Soviet Union and another is the foreign minister, Tserenpiliin
Gombosuren.
   The party also decided to hold a congress in February to discuss
its future and revise its platform and constitution.
   In a dispatch from the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, Xinhua
quoted the Mongolian newspaper Unen as saying the party leadership
would be voted on again in February.
   Ochirbat became chairman in March after demonstrations demanding
Soviet-style reforms.
   Under Ochirbat, the party agreed to give up its constitutional
guarantee of power. Mongolia's first multiparty elections, held in
July, kept the Communists in power but also gave new opposition
parties a strong voice in government.

   A condemned killer suspected in the
slayings of nearly two dozen young men is under investigation in
the fatal stabbing of an Indiana man whose body was found in 1982,
police said Friday.
   The investigation, launched a couple of weeks ago, is a result
of the release of a book detailing the life of Larry Eyler,
convicted in 1986 for the murder of 15-year-old Danny Bridges of
Chicago.
   Bridges' dismembered body was found in August 1984 in trash bags
behind Eyler's Chicago apartment. Eyler is on Death Row at the
Pontiac Correctional Center in Pontiac, 80 miles southwest of
Chicago.
   Eyler is suspected of killing 23 young men in Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky and Wisconsin from 1982 through 1984, said Detective Dan
Colin of the Lake County Sheriff's Department. He was tried only in
Bridges' death.
   According to court testimony, Eyler, a homosexual, was into
bondage. Some of his sexual partners testified that he enjoyed
tying them up. All of the victims in which Eyler is a suspect were
stabbed and their pants were pulled down.
   A judge in Lake County, where the body of 28-year-old Ralph E.
Calise of Chicago was found in August 1983, ruled that police
violated Eyler's rights during a search which officials said
yielded crucial evidence in the Calise case.
   In September 1983, Indiana authorities investigating Eyler in a
series of killings had confiscated some of his belongings,
including his boots and a knife. He was detained for hours but
never charged.
   Police later said blood taken from Eyler's boots matched
Calise's.
   Because Lake County officials believed Indiana authorities had
failed to make proper prints of the tires of Eyler's truck, they
conducted their own search.
   But the Lake County judge, convinced that Indiana authorities
had violated Eyler's constitutional rights, suppressed the Indiana
evidence. And because the Illinois search of Eyler was prompted by
the one in Indiana, the judge ruled that that evidence, too, should
be suppressed.
   Without the evidence, authorities had no case and Eyler, 36, of
Greencastle, Ind., was freed. Six months later, he was arrested in
Bridges' slaying.
   Since then, the evidence from the Indiana search had remained in
Lake County.
   On Wednesday, as a result of the book, ``Freed to Kill, The True
Story of Larry Eyler,'' prosecutor Larry Thomas of Vermillion
County, Ind., took the suppressed evidence to use in his
investigation of an unsolved murder.
   Detective Colin said Thomas had reopened the murder case of
23-year-old Steve Agan of Terre Haute, Ind., and planned to convene
a grand jury using the evidence that was suppressed in Illinois.
   Agan's body was found near Newport, Ind., in December 1982.
   ``My understanding is that the book gave them some insight they
didn't know back then,'' Colin said.
   ``We have a lot of unsolved murders out there,'' said Colin, one
of the investigators in the Calise case. ``I'm always glad when
someone is able to put together a murder case and solve their
stuff.''
   ``It's just too bad that a book had to come out to force Indiana
authorities to reopen some of the 16 cases attributed to Larry
Eyler,'' Kolarik said.

   Opposition parties in Serbia said
Friday they will boycott the republic's first free elections in 50
years because ruling officials rejected demands to change rules on
casting and counting ballots.
   The republic's communist-controlled Parliament on Thursday
denied requests to allow opposition officials into state-run
ballot-counting commissions, and permit some Serbs abroad to vote
in the Dec. 9 election.
   A statement by 12 opposition parties said Parliament's decision
blocked the ``most elementary conditions'' for fair elections and
``wiped out the last chance of compromise'' with the ruling
Socialists, the new name adopted by the communist party.
   The statement also demanded the resignation of Serbia's
communist President Slobodan Milosevic and the ouster of Parliament
leaders and other communist officials.
   The parties urged voters to join the boycott and attend a
protest rally Dec. 3 in Belgrade.
   The statement was signed by leaders of the center-right Serbian
Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party, the Serbian branch of
federal Premier Ante Markovic's Alliance of Reformist Forces, and
other parties.
   About 50 opposition parties are registered for the vote. Many
have complained they had less access to state-controlled media for
their campaigns.
   Vuk Draskovic, who was the top challenger to Milosevic, said his
Renewal Movement had planned to contest all 250 Parliament seats.
But under the boycott, only Milosevic's Socialists and a few newly
formed communist groups would run, he said.
   The statement said unfair elections would make Serbia ``along
with Albania, the last Bolshevik ghetto in Europe'' and isolate the
republic.
   Following the vote Thursday, Parliament Chairman Zoran Sokolovic
said current law, drawn up by the Socialists, ensures democratic
elections.
   Nebojsa Popov, head of the small opposition Union for Yugoslav
Democratic Initiative, said the vote would be ``a farce'' under the
present election rules.
   Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, and
Montengro, the smallest, are the last to hold multiparty elections.
   Communists were ousted last spring in the western republics of
Slovenia and Croatia.
   In the central state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, nationalist parties
had a landslide victory over communists.
   In last November's single-party Serbian elections, unregistered
voters were allowed to cast ballots in some districts. Milosevic
won with 104 percent of the registered voters in some areas.
   Parliament also began discussing a ban on the Democratic
Alliance of Kosovo, which opposes Serbia's rule over the Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 1.9
million people.
   The Democratic Alliance, supported by the ethnic Albanians,
registered as a party with federal authorities, but not with
Serbian officials. Serbia clamped down on the province's autonomy
in July after Kosovo's parliament declared sovereignty.

   Consumers wandered the nation's malls and Main Streets on
Friday, starting a Christmas shopping season that retailers fear
will be their worst in years because of the twin grinches of a weak
economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In keeping with a tradition that's as much a part of
Thanksgiving weekend as leftover turkey, shoppers lined up early,
some standing in the rain before stores opened.
   By midmorning, many an aisle was crowded, from midtown
Manhattan's swank department stores to the State Street Mall in
Chicago to the shops that ring San Francisco's picturesque Union
Square.
   ``We're having a phenomenal year, a record year,'' said Rebecca
Schulz, store manager for FAO Schwartz on Union Square. ``We opened
at 9 a.m. and there was a line waiting to come in past the toy
soldier. We're seeing everything fly out the door - the basic toys,
games, cuddly toys, electronic goods.''
   Other San Francisco merchants were similarly ebullient about the
1990 holiday season.
   But elsewhere, lines at some cash registers were ominously
short, substantiating fears of retailers who had predicted they
would host browsers, not buyers.
   Many shoppers are trimming holiday budgets because they already
have been squeezed financially by higher fuel prices, while talk of
an economic downturn has unnerved them.
   ``I'm going to cut mine at least in half,'' said Sharon Stowe of
Cary, N.C., who with her daughter-in-law was eyeing a model train
display at a mall in Raleigh.
   Wanda McNamara of New Cumberland, Pa., said she has not been
personally threatened with a layoff or loss of income. Still, she
is taking recession talk seriously.
   ``I'm watching my dollars,'' she said while waiting for Boscov's
department store to open in Harrisburg, Pa. ``I'm more careful,
more selective. I'm looking for sales. I'm cutting down on the
Christmas list.''
   The first few days of Christmas shopping season are scrutinized
by retailers because they're considered a barometer of what to
expect in their most critical time of year, when they make about
half their annual sales.
   No one is expecting this to be a great - or even very good -
Christmas shopping season.
   Some pessimists, including retail industry analyst Daniel Barry
of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New York, have even said it will be the
worst holiday season since the 1974 recession.
   The Thanksgiving weekend has lost some significance in recent
years because more consumers shop later in the season. But it still
helps stores decide when to offer sales and what items they must
restock.
   Gary Ebel, assistant general manager of Skagway department store
in Grand Island, Neb., said he had no idea how the holiday retail
season would turn out once the day after Thanksgiving had passed.
   ``Normally, it's one of the biggest days of the year for us,''
Ebel said. ``That's proved to be false for us for several years.
Our biggest day is the last Saturday before Christmas, and it seems
to be moving toward that trend.''
   Still, Ebel and other merchants resorted to gimmicks to lure
buyers.
   ``We gave away poinsettias to the first 300 customers, and we
got rid of those in 15 minutes,'' Ebel said. ``We had books of
stamps at 25 cents off today for two hours.''
   Consumer spending, which slipped as the economy weakened this
year, dropped precipitously after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Not only were consumers shaken by prospects of war, but they
suddenly found themselves paying more for gasoline and heating oil.
   The Middle East turmoil, however, has inspired some merchants. A
Florida discount store offered ``Put a Stain on Hussein'' toilet
paper, featuring pictures of the Iraqi leader, for $1 a roll.
   ``It's flying out of here,'' said Jack Rohn, manager of the
``Everything's A $1.00'' store at the Sawgrass Mills shopping mall
near Fort Lauderdale.
   The scenario is particularly grim for retailers hurt last
season. Many were forced to slash prices to bring in sales and
several suffered earnings drops or losses.
   Their hope to avoid a repeat this year is faint.
   At the giant Glendale Galleria mall in suburban Los Angeles,
many shoppers said the foot traffic looked lighter than usual
Friday.
   At D. Laurenti, a boutique specializing in $725 Italian suits
and $195 shirts, assistant manager John Tawlian said sales were off
as much as 30 percent as the holiday season began.
   ``We don't have big hopes,'' he said as shoppers strolled by his
empty store. ``Things could change, but if you ask me it's not
going to be as good as last year.''

<HEAD>U.S. Welcomes Lifting of Import Ban, Ends Trade Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thailand has agreed to legalize import of
American and other foreign cigarettes and the U.S. governent is
ending its 18-month investigation of unfair trade charges against
the Southeast Asian country, it was announced Friday.
   ``We have been guided by the principles of obtaining fair and
non-discriminatory access to the Thai market without in any way
seeking to encourage smoking as a personal habit,'' said a
statement from U.S. trade representative Carla A. Hills.
   The announcement did not mention cigarette advertising, banned
in Thailand, and one of the controversial issues in Washington
public hearings and in prolonged negotiations between the two
governments. But her office confirmed Mrs. Hills' mid-October
statement that ``with respect to advertising, we did not push that
issue.''
   The U.S. Cigarette Export Association filed charges of unfair
trading against Thailand in 1989. If upheld, those charges could
have led to retaliatory measures.
   Industry critics, including former U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Coop, objected that the U.S. government should not be
promoting exports of a health hazard.
   Some charged that the U.S. tobacco industry sought to undermine
Thailand's official anti-smoking campaign and to glamorize smoking
among new users such as youth and women. They said this happened in
three other Asian countries where U.S. cigarette brands gained
market access, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
   The U.S. industry and representatives of tobacco-growing states
demanded the issue be treated as strictly commercial. They charged
that the health issue was introduced to protect the Thai government
tobacco monopoly.
   ``As long as Thailand sees fit to produce and sell its own
cigarettes to its own people, we see no reason that foreign
cigarette manufacturers should not have the same opportunity,''
Mrs. Hills said Friday.
   A breakthrough in the case came when a panel of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade earlier this year supported U.S.
demands for market access, but did not support demands that U.S.
brands be allowed to advertise.
   Thailand then agreed to discuss admitting imports and the U.S.
side in mid-October passed up publishing a list of Thai products
subject to potential penalty duties if the ban had continued.
   Sunday was the deadline for Mrs. Hills to recommend final action
on the industry petition.
   Mrs. Hills said in October the U.S. government would abide by
the GATT ruling on advertising ``even though is going to be
difficult for foreigners to get their products in and known. It
will simply have to be carried by word of mouth.''
   Her office must decide by year-end on another U.S. industry
petition to launch a new investigation of Thailand involving piracy
of motion pictures, music recordings, computer softwear, books and
trademarks.

   A state prison guard was arrested
Friday and charged with killing a newlywed couple and a third
victim, whose dismembered body was found in several locations,
police said.
   Michael Laveglia, 30, of Beacon, was charged with three counts
of second-degree murder, state Trooper Robert Gillespie said.
   Laveglia, a guard at the Downstate Correctional Facility in
Fishkill, was accused of killing Thomas and Lorraine Thompson and
Joseph Realmuto. The Thompsons were found shot to death Thursday,
while police discovered Realmuto's remains early Friday in several
trash bins in Fishkill, Gillespie said.
   The couple's bodies were discovered by firefighters called to
put out a fire in their apartment in Clintondale, a hamlet on the
Hudson River about 60 miles north of New York City.
   State troopers said it wasn't clear when the killings occurred.
   The Thompsons had been shot with a .45-caliber gun, state police
Sgt. Ron Marek said. Police said they believe Laveglia, who was
also charged with arson, started the fire to cover the crime.
   The couple were married Nov. 3, said the woman's father, Rosario
Giunta.
   Laveglia was arraigned before Hurley Town Judge Athena Groelle
and ordered held in Ulster County Jail without bail, Gillespie
said.
   Corrections Department spokeswoman Ann Colodny said Leveglia
became a state prison guard in 1984 and had been working at the
Fishkill prison since 1986.

   Twenty private pilots took off Friday on an
annual airlift of medical supplies, clothing and food to a remote
Mexican town.
   ``We celebrated our own good fortune and the blessings we've had
on our Thanksgiving Day and then we try to give it to somebody else
afterwards because we've got plenty left over,'' said Don Greif,
66, an organizer of the 10-year-old event.
   Aviators from Santa Barbara to Bakersfield contributed items to
be flown in small planes from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles to
Santa Rosalia in Baja California. The town has an airstrip but no
control tower.
   This year's cargo included two new wheelchairs, crutches and
first aid packages - valuable items in a town miles from any
hospital.
   The town's copper mine closed years ago, increasing unemployment
where people already were underemployed, Greif said. ``It's a
deprived area,'' he added. ``There's no stable income there.''
   The airlift is a festive occasion. Children from the school
receive candy and clothes. And after the exhausting six-hour
flight, pilots are greeted with food and beer provided by
residents.
   Mexican marines guard the planes overnight and the pilots sleep
in the only hotel nearby - a place where showers are often cold.
   The 642-mile trip is not easy, said Greif.
   Fuel can be an obstacle. The U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Mexican government have been trying to stem
the flow of drugs out of the country by removing fuel supplies from
lesser known airstrips.
   The pilots fly over the sea for an hour after leaving Mexicali,
a border city where they go through customs and refuel.

<HEAD>Christmas Tree Poachers Draw Ire of Forest Rangers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christmas tree rustling in national forests
in southern California is one annual holiday season ritual that
should be stopped, forest rangers say.
   ``A lot of people think that if I just take one, it's not a
problem,'' said Carla Van Dyne at the Tujunga district office of
Angeles National Forest. ``Once they start cutting or even damage
(the tree), it is going to die.''
   U.S. Forest Service officials report problems with poachers
taking trees without permits and outside designated areas at Los
Padres, Angeles and San Bernardino national forests.
   Tree thievery is especially serious in Southern California
forests because there are relatively few evergreens to begin with.
The trees are already harmed by disease, insects and smog,
foresters said.
   Nabbing the culprits can be tough. For example, only six federal
employees keep watch over the 500,000-acre Mount Pinos reserve in
the Los Padres National Forest in northern Ventura County.
Officials estimate that thieves cut down and steal 20 to 30 fir and
pine trees every year.
   Don Trammell, a recreation and operations officer at Mount
Pinos, said about two tree rustlers are caught each year.
   The penalty for taking a tree is usually a $50 fine, but the
penalty can be as heavy as a $5,000 fine and can include a one-year
jail term.
   Mount Pinos firefighter Jamie Moore said thieves have been known
to climb tall firs and saw off the top half. The remainder of the
tree usually dies because it is vulnerable to a species of
wood-eating beetle, she said.
   ``What they are taking is not so much a commodity but something
that is high in value in the recreational sense,'' Forest Service
Officer John Kelly said.

   Eight hundred cows contaminated
with toxic compounds will be slaughtered and burned to ashes by the
end of the year in southern Moravia, the independent daily Mlada
Fronta Dnes reported Friday.
   Their milk and meat contain excessive levels of polychlorated
biphenyls (PCBs), with levels equally high in the meat of their
offspring, it said. It gave no precise figures.
   ``Newly born calves have the same levels of PCBs as their
mothers. That is why the first to be slaughtered were pregnant
cows,'' the daily quoted Zdenek Havlicek, chief of the Borsice
cooperative, as saying.
   It said that following slaughter of the first 150 cows Friday,
arrangements were made to pulverize the carcasses and put them in
special containers.
   PCBs are chemical additives contained in paint used for
agricultural equipment.
   Such chemicals were banned for use in Czechoslovakia in 1984,
but the PCB content in the food chain has been increasingly noticed
by environmentalists.
   To destroy PCBs, temperatures above 1,832 degrees are needed, it
said. But furnaces in Czechoslovakia cannot now work at such
temperatures.
   ``We are also storing some 150 tons of butter contaminated with
PCBs,'' Havlicek said.
   About 60 percent of the PCBs detected in the cows came from the
paint of silage pits and were absorbed through the cows' fodder,
Mlada Fronta Dnes said.
   The rest was blamed on general PCB pollution of the evironment,
it said.

   Customers deluged a Tucson supermarket
chain with turkeys, some of them already cooked, after a man
claimed to have injected some of the birds with cyanide.
   The Pima County health department said Friday that about 4,600
turkeys would be buried in a landfill north of Tucson. They
included about 550 turkeys the store took off its shelves and about
4,050 that customers returned.
   Jim Acton, vice president of media operations for Smith's Food
and Drug stores, estimated that the cyanide scare would cost the
supermarket chain as much as $200,000.
   The store on Friday offered a $10,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest of the perpetrator, and authorities in Tucson
and surrounding Pima County also offered a $1,000 reward.
   A man called reporter-anchorwoman Barbara Grijalva of KOLD-TV on
Wednesday to say he had injected some Smith's turkeys with cyanide.
Police have said there was no evidence that the birds were tainted.
   The supermarket chain removed turkeys from its four Tucson
stores and offered refunds or exchanges to customers who recently
had purchased turkeys. No stores outside of Tucson were affected.
   Ninety to 95 percent of the customers who brought turkeys to the
store on Thursday asked for a refund instead of another turkey,
store officials said.
   Samples have been taken of all the varieties of turkeys from the
Tucson stores and will be tested for poisoning, Acton said.
   ``It appears to be simply the work of a hoax of a very sick
person who either has a grudge to bear against Smith's or only
wished to cause a great deal of anguish among innocent people,''
Smith's chairman, Jeff Smith, said in a statement.

<HEAD>Mubarak Says Question of Iraqi Military Capacity Should Wait</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Friday
the United States and other countries should liberate Kuwait before
they confront the question of how to maintain peace in the face of
mounting Iraqi military power.
   ``Let us start by liberating Kuwait ... complete withdrawal and
then this issue should be studied in the negotiations after the
withdrawal,'' Mubarak said in an interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw
aired Friday night.
   The interview came after President Bush's visit earlier Friday
with the Egyptian president. Egypt has promised up to 20,000 troops
to the international force in Saudi Arabia to liberate Kuwait.
   Iraq maintains a chemical warfare capability and some analysts
say it will be able to launch nuclear-tipped missiles in 10 years
unless stopped. Strategists have pondered whether go beyond
liberating Kuwait in the current crisis and use the opportunity to
topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein before he gets a nuclear
arsenal.
   Mubarak brushed aside a question on what would happen if Saddam
were allowed to maintain his military power and used it to attack
Israel.
   ``You in America are going through so many items,'' Mubarak
said. ``You are saying, Supposing he may attack Israel, then he may
attack Saudi Arabia ... Iraq is not a superpower.''
   As for getting Iraq out of Kuwait, Mubarak said President Bush
``is eager to solve the problem peacefully as much as he can ...
but at the same time if he didn't find a way to solve it peacefully
he is going to use force.''
   ``There is no other way else,'' he said. ``If there is no other
way to solve the problem them we will have to use force.''
   But he reiterated that Egyptian forces would not go beyond
Kuwait and fight inside Iraq itself.
   ``Our troops will not go to Iraq because we are not going to
liberate Iraq,'' Mubarak said. ``The problem is Kuwait.''
   He also said the parties to the dispute ``should tackle the
Palestinian question because it is the crux of the whole problem.''
   ``This issue should move foward,'' he said. ``We should not
neglect it.''

   A judge denied bail Friday for one of five
juveniles charged in the Halloween rape and murder of a 26-year-old
woman, and a black leader blamed police for mishandling its
investigation because the woman was black.
   A woman who says she was a witness said she has been warned not
to talk to authorities.
   ``At this point in time I think that he should be tried as a
juvenile,'' said the juvenile's attorney, Juliane Balliro, after a
closed hearing in Suffolk Superior Court. ``He is 15 years of age
and he has no prior criminal involvement whatsoever.''
   Balliro's client is one of eight youths charged in the death of
26-year-old Kimberly Rae Harbour. Authorities alleged she was
bludgeoned, repeatedly raped, and stabbed more than 100 times by a
gang of teen-agers roaming the streets in search of women to rob.
   The Suffolk County district attorney is seeking to have the five
juveniles charged as adults in her death. Three other young men
aged 17, 18 and 19 were charged as adults.
   Conviction as an adult on a charge of first-degree murder would
bring an automatic life sentence without parole. If the five youths
are found delinquent as juveniles, they could be released on their
18th birthday.
   Also Friday, a leader in the city's black community, Sadiki
Kambon of the Black Information Center, called for the resignation
of Boston Police Commissioner Francis Roache.
   Kambon said the department's investigation into the slaying only
highlighted of failure of police to properly serve minorities in
the city.
   There was no immediate response from Roache to the call for his
resignation; he did not return telephone calls.
   The slaying more than three weeks ago initially drew little
public notice after police announced it as a homicide. Details
weren't released until this week after the arrests.
   
   Blacks have complained that residents should have been warned of
the attack earlier so they could protect themselves.
   Kambon also repeated criticism of the police handling of the
Stuart case. The shooting death of Carol Stuart in October 1989
brought police into a minority neighborhood to search for a suspect
after Stuart's husband, Charles, said he and his pregnant wife were
attacked there by a black mugger.
   Charles Stuart later apparently committed suicide after learning
he had become a prime suspect in his wife's death.
   Kambon also called for more minority police patrols in the inner
city and said minorities must do more to help youngsters.
   ``We have to assume some of the responsibility for what's going
on out here,'' Kambon said.
   Meanwhile, a possible witness of Harbour's death said she has
been warned not to talk to authorities.
   ``I need some protection,'' Laura Peterson, 40, told the Boston
Herald.
   Peterson told police she fled to safety while eight young men
chased Harbour into a park in the city's Dorchester section and
killed her.
   Peterson said a man knocked on the door of an apartment where
she was staying Thursday and gave her a message ``from a boy.'' She
said the message was to ``keep your mouth shut.''
   On the night of the killing, Peterson said she was standing with
Harbour, who she assumed was out ``selling her body.''
   She said three masked teen-agers tried to rob her before joining
others in chasing Harbour, who she said was yelling ``Help me, Help
me.''
   Peterson said she was too frightened, even after reaching a
friend's apartment, to call police.

<HEAD>Irish Prime Minister Enters Dispute Over Bronze Age Necklace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey on Friday
joined efforts to bring a 3,700-year-old necklace back to Ireland
from a London auction house.
   Officials at the National Museum of Ireland claim the Bronze Age
necklace, or lunula, was illegally taken from Ireland. It is now at
Christie's, a London-based auction company.
   Haughey said there is evidence the necklace was removed from
Ireland within the past two years in violation of the national
monuments act.
   ``The Irish authorities will take all necessary measures to
obtain the return of this important national treasure,'' the prime
minister said.
   The necklace, dated from about 1800 B.C., was found in County
Galway in 1975. Irish press reports had said the necklace was worth
about $39,200.
   Christie's spokesman Mark Wrey said the National Museum had
offered to buy the necklace for $23,500. He said when Christie's
called the museum to negotiate a price for its client, it was told
the necklace had been illegally exported. The client was not
identified.
   Christie's will not place a value on the piece until the
ownership dispute is resolved, he said.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday backed a film
director battling a Greek Orthodox bishop who has threatened to
vandalize the filmmaker's props and excommunicate anyone working on
his movie.
   The bishop claims the film is unpatriotic in calling for the
abolition of national borders. He also charges that a copy of the
script he has seen contains erotic scenes.
   ``The government unreservedly supports Theodore Angelopoulos and
the shooting of his film,'' Culture Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis
said.
   Angelopoulos, one of Greece's best known directors and the
winner of several European prizes, is due to start filming ``The
Suspended Stride of the Stork'' in Athens on Dec. 3 and in the
northern border town of Florina on Dec. 17.
   But the town's bishop, Avgoustinos Kantiotis, has threatened to
``destroy the props with fire and excommunicate'' anyone involved
in the film, Angelopoulos says.
   The film has a budget of $3.3 million, including some European
Community funding, according to the semi-official Athens News
Agency. Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni is expected to star in
the film.
   Among Angelopoulos' prize-winning films are ``The Traveling
Players,'' filmed in 1975; ``Megalexandros,'' 1980; and
``Landscapes in the Mist,'' 1988.

   Two members of the teen-age singing group Menudo
were fired Friday after being arrested at Miami International
Airport and charged with possession of marijuana.
   Sergio Gonzalez, 18, and a 16-year-old whose name was not
released because of his age, were charged Thursday after a U.S.
Customs Service dog smelled marijuana. Customs agents took small
amounts of the drg from them, Metro-Dade police Lt. James Kaelin
said.
   ``I guess some people call them personal-use amounts, but drugs
are drugs, no matter what amounts they are,'' said Customs
spokesman Joe Krokos.
   Oscar Llord, general manager for Sonotone Music, the group's
Miami recording company, said Friday the group's manager had fired
the two singers hours after their arrest.
   Menudo, based in Puerto Rico, has been around for 12 years,
rotating new members into the group as veterans grow too old to
appeal to a pre-teen and teen audience.

<TEXT>
   A woman with 46 personalities has
acknowledged having sex with a key witness in the trial of a man
who was convicted of sexually assaulting her.
   The admission is significant in part because, under Wisconsin
law, having sex with a mentally ill person can be a crime.
   Winnebago County District Attorney Joseph Paulus said the
27-year-old victim confirmed allegations in a court document that
she had a sexual relationship with Gerald Reeves, her downstairs
neighbor.
   ``She said, `It's true, I did do it,''' Paulus said, adding he
was uncertain whether the relationship would result in new criminal
charges.
   Mark Peterson, 29, of Oshkosh, was convicted earlier this month
of sexually assaulting the woman. Authorities argued he was guilty
of a crime because he manipulated one of her personalities in June
two days after he met her.
   Under Wisconsin law, it is a crime to have sex with a mentally
ill person if the person is so severely impaired he or she can't
appreciate the consequences of the behavior, and if the other
person knows of the illness.
   Paulus said it's not clear whether any charges would be filed
against Reeves. He said it would depend on whether the victim would
file a complaint and whether it could be proven she was taken
advantage of her because of her condition, called multiple
personality disorder.
   Reeves, who testified during the trial about the victim's
vulnerability, did not return telephone messages left at his house
Friday by reporters seeking comment. He said in an earlier
interview he was unaware of the allegations. He has not been
charged with any crime.
   Peterson's attorney, Mary Lou Robinson, said she would proceed
with her plan to request a new trial for her client, adding the
latest allegations would assist her appeal.
   ``The way this case developed has brought mockery upon the court
system,'' she said.
   Allegations that Reeves had a relationship with the woman were
contained in a letter sent Wednesday by a former Winnebago County
counselor to county Circuit Judge Robert Hawley.
   Sheila M. Carmichael, who counseled the woman, was fired earlier
Wednesday for entering into a contract last week for movie and
publication rights involving the victim's story.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's oldest chartered press
clubs, the 109-year-old Pittsburgh Press Club, will close its doors
for good by year's end.
   ``Let's just say that the program we thought would work just
didn't come to fruition. The bricks just didn't fall into place,''
club President A. Alan Paulus said Wednesday. ``It takes a lot of
support from the membership to keep it going. I'll just leave it at
that.''
   A federal bankruptcy judge officially turned down the club's
attempts to reorganize under bankruptcy protection earlier this
month. The club has been in financial trouble since the early 1980s
and filed for protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law
in March 1989.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph L. Cosetti said the club had ``no
reasonable prospect of reorganizing.''
   Officials blamed the club's decline on a number of factors,
including difficulty in attracting younger members, strife among
club officers and between officers and management. In addition,
many members did not return after a strike closed the club for
three months in 1983.
   In the latest attempt to save the Press Club, not affiliated
with The Pittsburgh Press, officials had slashed the staff from 42
to about a dozen, moved to less expensive quarters, increased dues
and added about 200 members.
   Paulus said he would ask members to pay $25 each to keep the
club operating through the holiday season.
   As of Sept. 30, the club had $372,384 in bills and only $28,988
in current assets to pay them. Some club vendors have unpaid bills
dating to 1985.

   Divers searched the murky water of Lake
Ellsworth on Friday for a civilian flight instructor missing after
a military helicopter crash.
   After two or three dives, there still was no sign of the missing
man, and the search was called off at dusk, said Fort Sill
spokeswoman Sheila Samples.
   ``They're still having some problems getting into the aircraft
... They can't seem to get it open or see in it to see if anybody
is in it,'' she said.
   A large Chinook helicopter brought in from Fort Sill partially
lifted the UHV-1 helicopter from the lake Friday, but the wreckage
broke free and fell back in, she said. Searchers will return to the
lake early Saturday, she said.
   The instructor and five members of the 374th Air Ambulance
Company were on an over-water training mission, working for the
first time with new night vision goggles, when the helicopter
crashed into the lake late Thursday.
   The cause of the crash was not known.
   The 374th is a Little Rock reserve unit activated as part of
Operation Desert Shield, Ms. Samples said. The unit, which has
about 50 members, arrived at Fort Sill on Sunday.
   Lakeshore residents in a 12-foot fishing boat rescued the five
crewmen.
   Three of the men were treated for hypothermia and minor cuts and
bruises at Reynolds Army Community Hospital, Ms. Samples said. They
were released from the hospital Friday.
   The missing man was identified as Phillip E. Walker, of
Sheridan, Ark., a civilian maintenance facility manager for the
Army at Little Rock, said Ms. Samples. Previous reports stated
incorrectly that he was a reservist.
   Ms. Samples said a team from the Army Safety Center at Fort
Rucker, Ala., was en route to Fort Sill to investigate.

<TEXT>
   Austrian immigrants who are paid
reparations to compensate for Nazi persecution cannot be
disqualified from receiving U.S. benefits for the low-income aged,
blind or disabled, a federal court has ruled.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said in a ruling
released Friday that Austrian reparations must be treated like
similar payments from the German government.
   The U.S. government had sought to differentiate Austrian from
German reparations, questioning whether Jews who fled Austria
should be considered victims of Nazi persecution.
   The ruling concerned a class-action lawsuit filed by an Austrian
immigrant, Herbert Bondy, who was 16 when his family fled Austria
in 1938 after Germany occupied the country.
   Bondy, who retired in 1980, had been received Social Security
payments as well as benefits for the blind when he received his
first reparation payment from Austria in 1988. The Social Security
Administration counted the payments as income and disqualified him
from benefits for his blindness.
   Henderson ruled that reparations from Austria must be treated
like those from Germany, referring to a 1984 ruling by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that excluded German reparations as income
in determining eligibility for federal benefits.
   About 8,800 people in the United States receive Austrian
reparations; an estimated 158 to 572 also collect federal benefits
for the aged, blind or disabled, Henderson said.
   The U.S. government has argued that only those interned by the
Nazis qualified for reparations.
   Henderson quoted the Austrian consul general in Los Angeles as
explaining Austrian reparations were for a moral obligation ``in
view of the great injustice and heavy suffering inflicted on the
victims of Nazi persecution while Austria was under Nazi
occupation.''
   Austria won back its independence in 1945 at the end of World
War II.
   According to the National Jewish Congress, Austria had
anti-Jewish laws as early as 1935 and, in 1938, Jews commonly
suffered beatings, lootings and deportations. A lawyer for the
group, J. Mark Waxman, described the reparations as modest but said
he didn't know precise amounts.
   The government's attorney could not be reached for comment
Friday.

<HEAD>Surgeon Who Did First Successful Liver Transplant to Quit
Transplants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Thomas Starzl, who led the world's first
successful liver transplant in 1967 and trained most of the
nation's doctors who can perform the operation, said Friday he
plans to quit surgery and concentrate on research.
   Starzl said the death earlier this month of one of his patients,
13-year-old Stormie Jones, left him emotionally drained. The
13-year-old Texas girl was the world's first recipient of a
heart-liver transplant in 1984.
   Starzl, 64, has not performed surgery since undergoing an
operation in August to clear a blocked artery.
   Liver transplants are ``so standardized, there really isn't any
point in my handling cases,'' he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
``We have eight to 10 lead surgeons.''
   Starzl said enough surgeons are qualified to transplant livers
to allow him to study the effects of FK-506, an anti-rejection drug
approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for use only at
Presbyterian University and Children's hospitals in Pittsburgh.
   About 1,000 transplant patients now take the drug, which studies
show is more effective than its predecessor, cyclosporine.
   Starzl said he also hopes to improve the search for organ donors
and delivery of their organs.
   Starzl performed the first liver transplant in 1963, and it
failed. He had his first success four years later at the University
of Colorado at Denver.
   He also pioneered development of a medical team that performed
200 kidney transplants at Colorado General and Denver Veteran's
Administration hospitals.
   Starzl began working in 1981 at the University of Pittsburgh,
which he helped turn into one of the world's premier transplant
centers. Last year, the hospital performed more than 460 liver
transplants and 210 kidney transplants.
   Since Starzl's earliest efforts, thousands of such transplants
have been performed around the world.
   On Valentine's Day 1984, Starzl led the team that lifted a
diseased heart and liver from Stormie Jones, then 6, and replaced
them, giving her six more years of life.
   ``I saw her grow up, and I saw her at death's door,'' said
Starzl, who was one of her principal surgeons.
   Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, died Nov. 11 when her body
suddenly rejected her transplanted heart more than six years after
the historic operation that saved her life.
   ``When you lose a patient like that, it's awful,'' said Starzl,
who was traveling in Europe when he learned she had died.

University Medical School for 45 years.
   Dr. Cobb, 86, died Tuesday at George Washington University,

   An amateur violinist and historian who once estimated that he
had helped train more than 6,000 physicians as a teacher of
anatomy, Cobb wrote more than 600 scientific papers in a career
that saw service on many scientific and government committees.
   He was a member of the board of directors of the NAACP for more

served as president of the National Medical Association, the
leading organization of black physicians, and was editor of its
journal from 1949 to 1977.
   A native of Washington, Dr. Cobb attended Amherst College and
Howard University Medical School and received a doctorate in
anatomy at Case Western Reserve University before joining the
Howard faculty in 1928.
   Dr. Cobb is survived by two children and four children. His wife
of 47 years, Hilda, died in 1976.

   President Bush, trying to tighten the Arab
coalition against Iraq, held talks today with Egypt's Hosni Mubarak
after an exhilarating Thanksgiving visit with U.S. combat forces at
remote desert outposts.
   ``We won't pull punches,'' Bush promised troops in Saudi Arabia.
   The Egyptian president put aside his cautious style of
leadership to lead Arab opposition to Iraq after its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. Bush rewarded Mubarak by requesting - and
obtaining - congressional legislation waiving more than $7 billion
in Egyptian military debt to the United States.
   The two leaders met at Kubbah Palace, an ornate guest house for
foreign officials visiting Egypt.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The off-again, on-again attitude of the Soviet
Union on using force to liberate Kuwait is a problem for the Bush
administration. Moscow's support is vital, and November is drawing
to a close.
   The significance of the calendar is that the United States is
president of the United Nations Security Council this month. Then
it's Yemen's turn, and the Arab nation has opposed most of the
resolutions aimed at Iraq since the August invasion.
   Running the Security Council gives the Bush administration a
tactical advantage. Once Yemen is in the chair it would be that
much tougher to win adoption of a resolution to use force as a last
resort to liberate Kuwait.
   ``There's a lot of ways to get thoroughly wrapped around the
axle of the United Nations,'' a senior State Department official
said recently about the intricacies of the world organization.
``There are a whole host of other things that can come up. So it's
important to try and do it during the period of our presidency of
the council.''

   Saddam Hussein answered President Bush's trip to the Saudi
desert with his own morale-boosting mission to Iraqi troops in
Kuwait, telling them he is ready to fight ``the evil blasphemers''
if attacked.
   The U.S.-dominated force in the gulf got a boost, meanwhile,
with Britain's announcement Thursday that it was nearly doubling
its forces, bringing its contribution to 30,000 - the second
largest contingent after the United States. Sharing a turkey dinner
with U.S. troops in the sands of the Saudi desert, President Bush
promised them that ``We are not here on some exercise.''
   ``And we're not walking away until our mission is done, until
the invader is out of Kuwait,'' he said. ``And that may well be
where you come in.'' The troops cheered with approval.
   The president also cautioned that Iraq was developing nuclear
capability, and he warned that Saddam ``never possessed a weapon he
didn't use.''

   LONDON (AP) - Hailed as the end of an era that transformed
Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decision to resign has
angered supporters, pleased opponents and left three men battling
to succeed her.
   Ex-defense secretary Michael Heseltine, whose challenge
precipitated her resignation announcement Thursday, was joined in
the Conservative Party leadership race by Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd and Treasury chief John Major.
   A new poll today indicates the party, led by Mrs. Thatcher for
15 years, stands a better chance of winning an election now that
she agreed to step down when the party picks her replacement next
week.
   The Conservatives had lagged behind the opposition Labor Party
in recent surveys as a result of high inflation and interest rates
as well as an unpopular per capita tax.

   Consumers tend to spend more during the holidays, but

Union's first private ballet company, the Bolshoi-Grigorovich,

a new version of ``The Nutcracker.''
   A country-western vs. Russian classical ballet dance-off pitting

   If it were possible to record the stale
smell of beer and cigarettes in the air, the wet circles left on a
counter from bygone drinks and the jaded eyes of souls deep in
their cups, you'd come up with Burning Tree.
   The California trio's self-titled debut album on Epic draws upon
the guitar-based blues of such '60s legends as Cream and the Jimi
Hendrix Experience for its sound - a refreshing change from glossy,
overproduced radio fare.
   Burning Tree may sound like they've been trapped in a time warp,
but they don't write songs that way.
   ``We're very derivative, I suppose, of the older sound, but when
you're a three-piece band, you either sound like the Police or you
sound like Cream,'' bassist Mark Dutton said in a recent telephone
interview.
   ``When you're playing as a three-piece, everybody has so much to
do that you basically have to be proficient on your instrument, so
when you do that and you get into that jam mode, you go over the
edge,'' he said.
   Blues references, probably more so than classic rock ones,
abound in Burning Tree's down-and-dirty style. The album's title
track warns against taking unnecessary risks in life, like flying
on ``a one-winged eagle.''
   The ballad ``Playing in the Wind'' is the band's warning to
itself about letting fame go too far. On the same theme, the
delightful ``Crush,'' about the pitfalls of show business, shows a
healthy sarcasm for people who've ``got a crush on one of us, but
they don't know which one it is.''
   Dutton said Burning Tree's self-appointed task was to update the
blues' subject matter.
   ``All the great blues artists, the reason they were so great and
so loved is because they sang about their reality, they sang about
their life,'' he said. ``I think what we want to do is keep that
sound that appealed to your ears so much, but bring it up to date
psychologically.''
   All three members of the band - Dutton, guitarist Marc Ford, and
drummer Doni Gray - sing and write material.
   Dutton, who had always been in charge of previous bands, said it
was a learning experience not to be calling all the shots.
   ``You have to stifle those feelings'' of being in charge, he
said. ``Those are natural feelings, but you have to trust the other
two people in your band - and that's the only reason we're a band
is because we do trust each other.''
   The album's deliberate underproduction is noteworthy. Ford's
hoarse, raspy voice is left alone, even when it cracks during a
verse, and the album's entire sound is kept murky and dingy, true
to its blues roots.
   ``If we actually do get a take all the way through where we sing
the right words, then we have to keep it, because chances are, we
wouldn't be able to do it again,'' he said.
   ``But it gives the song charm, you know. It's kind of like the
perfect human being - who would want to be with someone perfect?
It'd get real boring after a while.''
   Dutton credited producer Tim Palmer, who also worked on David
Bowie's ``Tin Machine,'' for keeping Burning Tree's live sound
intact. ``We had all these old ideas and he just knew when we were
going a little too far and would step in and bring us up to date.''
   Burning Tree has been performing live for a year and a half. The
album was recorded in just eight weeks. Asked if the band had paid
its dues, Dutton said:
   ``I hope we never finish paying our dues, but I think our heads
are in the right place right now, whether you want to call it
paying your dues or not. We just happened to be at the right place
at the right time - there's really no formula whatsoever.
   ``We just play honestly and I think people can tell that,'' he
said.

   Creditors demand money, foreign
currency reserves are being drained to repay short-term loans and
domestic price increases are overdue, so Pakistan is asking for
help.
   ``There's no way we can cover the losses ourselves; $1 billion
we can make up on our own, but we need help with another billion,''
said Sartaz Aziz, finance minister of the new government.
   Japan was the first to respond, offering a $500 million aid
package when President Ghulam Ishaq Khan visited Tokyo for the
enthronement of Emperor Akihito.
   In an effprt to make up the first billion, Pakistan plans to
raise domestic prices, implement strict oil conservation measures
and push exports while reducing imports. Gasoline prices went up
more than 40 percent this month.
   Last month, the United States suspended $500 million in aid
because of suspicions that Pakistan has or is developing nuclear
weapons.
   ``It doesn't hurt us immediately,'' Aziz said. ``There's still
some aid in the pipeline.''
   Because of the financial problems, former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto may have found a silver lining in her stunning election
defeat Oct. 24. Political analysts and economists say the
opposition seats appear to be the safest place in Parliament at the
moment.
   Little was done about the economy for three months after Ishaq
Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government Aug. 6 for alleged
corruption.
   The caretaker administration he appointed concentrated on
keeping the nation afloat until a new government could be chosen.
It refused to increase prices because of the imminent election,
paying its bills instead with short-term loans at high interest
rates.
   Now, the economic problems are likely to interfere with the
industrial revolution conservative Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
promised.
   Even the left saw the victory of Sharif, a wealthy businessman
from humble beginnings, as a catalyst for ending centuries of
control by the feudal landlords class, to which Ms. Bhutto belongs.
   Economists say fiscal realism will have to be an essential part
of the Sharif government's plans.
   ``You can't just do things because you want to,'' one said, on
condition of anonymity. ``You've got to bite the bullet, increase
prices or raise taxes or both.''
   Foreign currency reserves have fallen to only $50 million, the
inflation rate is rising and another $2 billion has been added to
the foreign debt, raising it to about $15.5 billion.
   A Western economist said the additional debt was largely due to
the higher oil price. He said the International Monetary Fund was
holding back nearly $300 million until Pakistan improved its
economic performance.
   Aziz said Iraq's invasion of Kuwait nearly four months ago was
costing Pakistan about $33 million a month.
   Sharif initially refused Aziz's request for price increases
because most of Pakistan's 110 million people are landless laborers
who earn less than $400 dollars a year.
   Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of international aid,
a total of about $3 billion a year. Some senior officials suggested
the government might have to suspend payments on the debt, but Aziz
said that was not being considered.

   Rocky the lion roars with hunger
and Josefa the polar bear sweats in front of a fan. Porota, the
only hippo, stands in a concrete water tank not much larger than
she, looking doleful.
   The Buenos Aires zoo is in bad shape.
   About 1,800 animals are crowded onto 47 acres of land. The
budget of $2 million a year is hardly enough to feed them, let
alone provide mates or enough living space and caretakers.
   ``The worst is that, a year ago, we had to kill the goats and
cows to feed other animals,'' said Juan Romero, a veterinarian who
is the zoo's director.
   Five years ago, a hippo died after eating a can and its head was
sold for $5,000 to buy food for other animals. Now, the head is
displayed in a trendy disco called Hippopotamus.
   A flamingo choked to death on a coin tossed by a visitor. Toto
the giraffe died after swallowing a plastic bag. A condor, used to
soaring over mountains, can barely spread his great wings without
hitting the bars of his cage.
   Porota is not the only solitary animal. The zoo also has only
one rhinoceros, giraffe and elephant.
   Replacing animals was too expensive for municipal
administrations that suffered inflation, recession and near
bankruptcy in recent years. An elephant can cost $70,000 and a
rhino $150,000.
   When it opened 102 years ago, the Buenos Aires zoo was an oasis
of shady paths and exotic animals in the noise and pollution of a
city that would grow to a population of 10 million.
   Now, the grass is gone from many enclosures, leaving only dust
and concrete. Some buildings are boarded up and there are few
attendants to remind visitors not to feed the animals, try to catch
them or poke them with sticks.
   Last month, the city leased the zoo to Gerardo Sofovich, a
television host and animal lover, who said he would invest $5
million to buy new animals and spruce the place up.
   Among his plans are building an aquarium and conducting public
education programs about animals and the outdoors.
   Some critics say Sofovich's motives are more mercenary than
philanthropic. They claim his proposed admission fee of about $2
would recoup his investment in a single year and effectively close
the zoo to the poor.
   ``Sofovich ... doesn't want to improve the quality of life of
the animals, but rather enrich himself,'' said Raquel Celoria, who
leads a neighborhood group opposed to the deal.
   The Association for the Defense of Animal Rights believes the
number of animals should be reduced by half rather than increased.
   Other opponents cite Sofovich's friendship with President Carlos
Menem and zoo director Romero, a former business partner, in
claiming favoritism.
   Romero responded: ``Those who are protesting now, why didn't
they do anything when the animals were starving?''
   ``People say stupid things,'' Sofovich commented. ``It's not as
if we're going to put in a disco, like some people say. We are
going to do what ... governments could not'' because they didn't
have the money.

<HEAD>George Carlin Finds Co-Star Status in `Trash'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his new album, George Carlin says he's never
sure what he can say, because of the Federal Communications
Commission. The FCC once got cranky when a radio station played
Carlin's album containing seven naughty words.
   Ergo, he explains, he has adopted his own policy about things he
won't say.
   He will not, for instance, say ``game plan,'' ``role model,''
``happy camper,'' ``lifestyle'' or ``moi.'' And ``we will not
maximize, prioritize or finalize,'' and ``we definitely will not
spend any ... quallllity tiiiime.''
   Be that as it may, he thinks he spent quality time on ``Working
Trash,'' Fox Broadcasting's first TV movie, airing tonight.
   Carlin considers it quality time because the film promotes him
from character player to co-star as one of two Wall Street janitors
who get rich by investing on information they find in company
trash.
   Given the state of Wall Street today, that would seem a sure way
to oblivion. No matter.
   Carlin, 53, considers the co-star part a step up. He doesn't
think it's a bit late in the game for him.
   ``It would be if I'd been chomping at the bit all this time,''
said Carlin, who wears T-shirts that say New York Police Bomb Squad
but speaks seriously in interviews. At such times, he doesn't play
the foole, as he likes to spell it.
   ``I put my acting desires aside in the late '60s when I found I
really wasn't very good at it,'' he said. ``It had been my plan
from childhood to become a radio disc jockey, then a stand-up
comedian, then a Danny Kaye, Bob Hope or Red Skelton kind of actor.
   ``But when I tried that ... I just lacked confidence.''
   In his defense, Carlin's first time was in the Marlo Thomas
sitcom, ``That Girl.''
   In recent years, though, matters have improved, namely
well-received character turns as Rufus in ``Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure'' and the soused old-hippie guide of
``Outrageous Fortune.''
   ``What's nice about approaching it at this age is that I bring a
lot more seasoning to my acting,'' he said, ``and it gives me a
career to look forward to.''
   A New Yorker, Carlin has lived in Los Angeles since 1966. As two
generations of comics since have done, he went to Hollywood to grab
the brass sitcom ring.
   He was one of the early hipster comics, a coffee-house graduate,
a guy who loved word-play - still does - and, as the '60s heated
up, developed social and political edges to his humor.
   A far cry from what some call ``brick-wall comics,'' the new
wave of sitcom aspirants who wear black and usually appear on cable
against a nightclub's brick wall, discussing relationships,
flossing and Los Angeles freeways.
   He's kindly, if ambivalent, about them, even those who are
somewhat to the left of whoopee: ``They have at least a few minutes
that's interesting and worthwhile, and I find myself glad I hear
that part.''
   Aren't they a little, er, blah, though? He shrugs. ``Well, there
are so many,'' he said. ``It (comedy) has become a cottage industry
in a way. It's just the sheer numbers that would dictate a certain
sameness.''
   Despite all that, he keeps working in comedy, although in venues
where he now, for a night's work, earns what one might call a
bundle.
   He does at least 110 concerts a year, he said, and has taped
seven Home Box Office specials. And then there are the comedy
albums. Last week, he released his 14th. It's entitled ``Parental
Advisory: Explicit Lyrics.''
   The album has no lyrics, technically speaking, but does have a
certain amount of raunch. The title comes from the sticker some
record labels put on their albums when the records are of 2 Live
Crew nature.
   ``I just thought using that sticker as the entire album label
was the appropriate thing to do,'' he said, alluding to groups that
have loudly protested what they call obscenity in rap and other
kinds of music.
   ``Because as long as you're going to have to deal with these
people ... you might as well mock them. So the whole album is one
large warning sticker.''
   Carlin wasn't pressured to make his album cover a warning label.
He owns the company that made the album. It's called Eardrum
Records.
   He grinned.
   ``Our slogan,'' he said, ``is `Stick it in your ear.' ''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   REASONS NO. 396 and 396.5 TO CONTINUE BREATHING: The syndicated
``The Joan Rivers Show'' has been renewed for a third season, an
tonight's edition of the syndicated ``Geraldo'' will do sort of a
``The Big Chill'' number.
   The series' host, Geraldo Rivera, is devoting the entire show to
his reflections on the '60s - you know, stuff like Vietnam, civil
rights and the Beatles. He uses as a starting point his return to
the University of Arizona, his alma mater, for a 25th anniversary
class reunion.
   A press release on tonight's show says viewers also will see the
school's homecoming queen of 1965, ``the girl Geraldo admired from
afar, but never had the courage to ask for a date.''

<DATELINE>RED HOOK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marc Eisenson has an important message for
Americans: Do yourself, your country and your grandchildren a big
favor and pay a few more dollars on your monthly bills. Make it a
habit.
   The withering industrial base, the federal deficit, the savings
and loan crisis and even Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait make
it more imperative than ever that Americans get out of debt,
Eisenson says.
   ``It just makes it clear that future stability is not assured,''
Eisenson said of world events. ``If I am out of debt I can weather
a lot of storms.''
   Americans owe $2.4 trillion in mortgage debt and another $729
billion in consumer credit bills, Federal Reserve figures show.
   Ironically, those big mortgages provide many people with their
greatest opportunity to save money.
   According to Eisenson, no investment - not Treasury bonds, not
the stock market - is more lucrative in the long run than simply
spending money to retire debts. That allows people to avoid
interest payments that run around 20 percent on many credit cards.
   ``If you were to bring your balance down it's like earning 20
percent with your money,'' said Eisenson. ``Twenty percent is more
than Donald Trump can earn safely. It is absolutely guaranteed,
risk-free. And it is available to only those who are, unfortunately
or fortunately, in debt.''
   Eisenson calls his system debt management, and insists it holds
the key to happiness and financial security for millions of
Americans.
   The concept is especially effective when applied to long-term
debt, such as mortgages. Paying a few dollars extra a month can
take thousands of dollars and years off a typical mortgage.
   At 10 percent, a $75,000 mortgage takes 30 years to pay and
winds up costing the borrower a total of $237,000.
   By paying just $25 a month extra, a person can save $34,000 and
take five years off the mortgage, according to Eisenson's formula.
Pay $100 a month extra and save $78,000 and 12 years off the same
mortgage.
   ``Get in the habit of debt management. I don't care how strapped
you are, you can pay some money, even an extra five or 10
dollars,'' said Eisenson. ``You can start the process to free
yourself of debt with very little money, the kind of money
everybody has got.''
   Eisenson said he learned his debt-free values from his parents,
who lived fairly simple lives. His brother taught him how to apply
those values to mortgages, and he paid off a 30-year mortgage in
five years at age 27. A former electrical engineer, Eisenson, 47,
has devoted the last fifteen years to developing his debt
management system.
   That system is spelled out in The Banker's Secret, a 233-page
book published this year by Villard Books, a division of Random
House. Before the book, Eisenson delivered his message through a
constantly evolving booklet.
   Along with his partner, Nancy Castleman, Eisenson has also
developed a computer program to allow consumers to tailor
prepayment plans to their individual needs.
   ``We're zealots. We want to change the world. We want to reach
every homeowner in America with our message. It's just crazy to
give $34,000 or more to a bank when you could use that money to put
kids through college or finance your retirement,'' said Castleman.
``How many homeowners are there in this country with mortgages?
That's how many people we want to reach.''
   Too many Americans do not understand the mechanics of debt and
how easily they can avoid thousands of dollars in interest by
paying more than the minimum each month, Eisenson said.
   ``Most people just don't understand it is something they can
really use,'' Eisenson said. ``Without making any significant
change in the short term, without going without, people can
dramatically change their lives in the long term.''
   Lately, people are more receptive to his message.
   ``People are no longer in the spend generation,'' he said.
``Many are in financial trouble or on the edge of it. A lot of
people really do begin to prepay and it makes a significant
difference in their lives.''

<HEAD>Just in Time for the Holidays: Two Explicit Rap Compilations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two record companies, cranking up the volume in
the ongoing music censorship battle, are asking music fans to buy
new albums because of their explicit lyrics, not in spite of them.
   Released just in time for holiday gift-giving, two rap
compilations are bound to reignite the furor over profane lyrics
that surrounded 2 Live Crew's trial last month on charges of
performing obscene material at a Florida nightclub. The rap group
was acquitted.
   Priority Records says its ``Explicit Rap'' compilation was
released for political reasons, while organizers of Reprise
Records' ``2 Nasty 4 Radio'' cited business motives.
   ``The only difference between a CD of this stuff and cocaine is
you can't fit it up your nose,'' Jack Thompson, the Florida lawyer
who crusaded against 2 Live Crew, said of the new albums.
   The new records have brought charges from within the rap
community that some artists are just trying to cash in on a
controversy that has made the front pages.
   Among the featured songs on ``Explicit Rap'' are 2 Live Crew's
``Me So Horny'' and a handful of profanity-laced raps against the
censorship movement. On ``2 Nasty 4 Radio'' a rapper in the number
``Talk Like Sex'' brags that his sexual prowess will leave his
partner looking like a rape victim.
   The cover of ``Explicit Rap'' is a blown-up version of the
sticker that the recording industry devised this year to warn
parents against explicit lyrics.
   All profits from the album's sale will be donated to music
critic Dave Marsh's ``Right to Rock Network,'' an organization
fighting censorship, said Priority spokeswoman Lillian Matulic.
   ``It's not just about cussing,'' Matulic said. ``It's a
statement.''
   Along with being intentionally provocative, Marsh said the album
- featuring artists like Ice-T, N.W.A., the Geto Boys and Ice Cube
- contains some of the most exciting rock 'n' roll being made
today.
   The New York City rap label Cold Chillin' Records, which has a
distribution deal with WEA label Reprise, initially designed its
compilation as a forum for new songs by its artists, said Tyrone
Williams, Cold Chillin' chairman. WEA suggested the ``2 Nasty 4
Radio'' concept, he said.
   Williams said he tried to downplay the profanity, asking rapper
Roxanne Shante to change the name of her new song to ``Brothers
Ain't Slick'' instead of the profane alternative. Shante refused.
   But Williams and rappers Kool G Rap and MC Shan defended ``2
Nasty 4 Radio'' as giving consumers what they want in a package
that's going to attract attention.
   Kids who attend his performances chant for his more obscene
material, Shan said. He's happy to oblige.
   ``That's just us expressing what we see, feel and how we do
things. They (the fans) love thumpin' that in the jeeps, in the
cars.''
   Jon Shecter, editor of The Source, a rap music magazine, said
the Priority Records compilation is the more valuable of the two
musically. But he said both albums represent blatant attempts to
cash in on the controversy.
   He said they would hurt the cause of rap music and predicted
they wouldn't sell that well.
   ``I don't think rap fans really want to hear that,'' Shecter
said. ``Rap fans want to hear good music. If it happens to have
profanity on it, that's part of the package.''
   Thompson, the lawyer who led the anti-2 Live Crew crusade, said
he found these albums even more abhorrent than 2 Live Crew's
material because obscenity is the whole point of the records
instead of a byproduct of the work.
   He predicted that the record companies would face obscenity
charges over the material and that anti-censorship forces will
regret picking a fight over these albums.
   But Marsh, whose organization distributes pamphlets and
organizes local anti-censorship movements across the country, said
it's important to have the showdown now.
   ``It's time to spit in the eye of the censors,'' Marsh said.
``It's time to stop acting timid and start being bold about what
the real issue is - the real issue is free speech.
   ``Every store that carries this record is making a statement
that they know what the score is, that they know the warning label
is a joke. It's a front for censorship, not some parental warning.
... Maybe, in fact, it ought to become a badge of honor.''

<HEAD>Oscar-Winning Director of `Cinema Paradiso' Releases New Film</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giuseppe Tornatore remembers his low point.
   A film on which he had worked for years closed after a few days.
Producers were cool. Friends were politely suggesting a career
change.
   ``Instead of committing suicide, I wrote a new film,'' he said,
laughing.
   Two years after that dark period, the 34-year-old Tornatore is
being hailed as Italy's hottest new director in a decade.
   The film that flopped in 1988, ``Cinema Paradiso,'' went on to
win him an Oscar in 1990. And the movie written ``in a moment of my
life in which things were bad'' is being released in a moment in
which things couldn't be better.
   ``Everything has gone so well,'' said the grinning, baby-faced
director, his eyes sparkling behind horn-rimmed glasses. ``I'm
sorry there was so much delay.''
   Two years after its dismal debut, ``Cinema Paradiso'' is alive
and well in Italian cinemas, and has drawn crowds in Europe, Japan
and the United States.
   Now, the question is whether Tornatore can succeed again, and
prove himself an heir to Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci and
other great Italian directors.
   His new film, ``Stanno Tutti Bene'' (They're All Fine), produced
by Angelo Rizzoli, has just been released in Italy and is due to
open in the United States in February.
   It tells of an elderly man's journey through Italy to visit his
five widely scattered children, whom he wants to reunite for a
dinner.
   The father, played by Marcello Mastroianni, is chagrined to
discover that his children have drifted from him and have hidden
their failures at work and in marriage.
   ``I wanted to make a film about the difficulty there is today in
personal communication,'' said Tornatore, sipping mineral water in
a cafe near his apartment by the Vatican wall.
   ``We live in an era of communication, of mass media. But the
nearer we move to events, the more difficult it is to communicate''
with people.
   While the film displays Tornatore's keen eye for the Italian
character and for day-to-day human comedy, it is more melancholy
than ``Cinema Paradiso,'' a semiautobiographical tale of a child
enraptured by the silver screen.
   ``Stanno Tutti Bene'' was written ``in a moment of my life in
which things were bad. I identified with the moods of people,
especially those who were suffering, and also their failures,''
Tornatore said.
   A movie buff who began making documentaries at age 20, Tornatore
already had two films to his credit - ``La Camorrista'' (The
Camorra Member) and ``Cinema Paradiso.''
   But they made little money. ``Cinema Paradiso,'' a cherished
personal project, attracted little notice and quickly closed.
Tornatore feared he would no longer be able to make his own films.
   But then ``Cinema Paradiso'' won an award at the 1989 Cannes
Film Festival and returned to movie theaters. It went on to become
the first Italian film to win Best Foreign Film at the Academy
Awards since Fellini's ``Amarcord'' in 1975.
   ``I am happy because what happened was important,'' he said. He
added, however, that now ``I don't have any more time ... not even
to know if I'm fine or not.''
   The idea for ``They're All Fine'' came about four years ago when
Tornatore saw a dignified elderly man with a suitcase eating alone
in a Roman trattoria.
   ``I thought to myself, `Where is he going?' I invented the idea
that he was searching for his kids.''
   The father's personal saga has modern Italy as its backdrop,
peopled by power-obsessed young professionals, African immigrants
sleeping in cardboard boxes and elderly parents closeted in
retirement homes by their children.
   Tornatore, who like the father comes from a Sicilian town,
objects to an urban society that has allowed answering machines and
television to eclipse human conservation.
   ``I was conscious of the fact that during the day I call Paris
or Tokyo or send faxes. Sometimes I make friendships by fax,
without ever seeing the person's face,'' said Tornatore. ``Then
when I return home, I don't know who lives next door. ... The long
distances have shrunk. The small distances have become longer.''
   He said the film's title sums up the gloss we use to cover the
difficulties of modern-day society.
   ``It's a phrase we say every day. We are all always just too
happy,'' he said. ``There's no one who says, `I'm not fine.''
   ``Maybe it's a world of hidden unhappiness. Maybe it's easier to
finish it there - people prefer to say something uncomplicated. ..
. It's very symptomatic of this era.''

<HEAD>Recession May Be As Difficult As Political Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa faces economic
problems that are intertwined with the black-white political
conflict and may be as difficult to solve.
   A year-old recession is expected to last through 1991.
Unemployment is rising, black shantytowns are expanding and whites
are joining the lines at soup kitchens.
   Economics has become a major part of the debate on South
Africa's future.
   Government officials and most other whites say capitalism is the
quickest route to prosperity for all. The African National Congress
and other anti-apartheid groups, particularly labor unions, favor
socialism and demand a major redistribution of the wealth
controlled by whits.
   ``The economic debate is likely to become a great deal more
heated if South Africa shifts ... to long-term stagflation,'' said
Business Day, the country's leading financial daily. ``The merits
of a market economy are less obvious when a stagnant economy ... is
accompanied by ever rising prices.'' South Africa's economy is the
strongest and most diverse on an impoverished continent, but is
expected to shrink about 2 percent this year and not to grow in
1991.
   With the population increasing at more than 2 percent a year,
President F.W. de Klerk says the economy needs at least 5 percent
annual growth if living conditions for blacks are to improve
substantially.
   As the economy declines, black expectations are rising with de
Klerk's political reforms and his promise to dismantle the
apartheid system of racial segregation.
   Blacks in South Africa have long equated apartheid with
capitalism and many expect a new political system to bring major
economic changes. For many blacks, that means socialism despite its
failure in Eastern Europe and elsewhere in Africa.
   Annual per capita income for South African blacks is equivalent
to more than $1,000, making it one of Africa's highest figures but
only a fraction of what the average South African white earns.
   No accurate unemployment figures are available, but private
economists say the rate is at least 15 percent for blacks and that
20 percent to 30 percent more are underemployed. In the southern
city of Port Elizabeth, black unemployment is almost 50 percent.
   Operation Hunger, which feeds needy blacks in rural areas,
estimates it is helping 1.5 million people, up from about 1 million
at the start of 1990.
   ``We are getting more requests for help than ever before,'' said
Bernie Cohen, financial director of the 10-year-old organization.
   John Rees, who runs the Methodist Care food distribution project
in Johannesburg, said growing numbers of whites are losing their
jobs and seeking assistance.
   De Klerk's government recently conceded that the black housing
shortage, a perennial crisis, is getting worse as 1 million blacks
a year move to cities in search of work. About 7 million of the
country's 30 million blacks already live in shacks they built
themselves, private groups report.
   The government speaks of spending more to improve black living
conditions, but supports a huge bureaucracy created by apartheid.
   About one of every three working whites is employed by the
government. Much of the bureaucracy is duplicated in a system that
has separate branches for whites, blacks, Asains and people of
mixed race, plus separate structures in the 10 black homelands.
   Strikes by black workers have increased as unions demand higher
wages from white managements accustomed to cheap labor. Gold
mining, for example, faces a combination of rapidly rising costs
and a stagnant world price.
   South Africa is the world's largest producer of gold, which
provides more than 40 percent of its export earnings, but many of
its mines are among the world's deepest and most expensive to
operate.
   Gold is hovering at about $380 an ounce on world markets. The
magazine Financial Mail said ``the industry will continue to
battle'' as long as the price stays under $400, and ``this will
ripple through the economy as recession deepens.''
   An estimated 31,000 of the 500,000 workers in gold mining have
lost their jobs in the past year and about 15 mines are in
financial trouble, according to the Chamber of Mines, an umbrella
group of leading companies.
   Foreign economic sanctions imposed because of apartheid also
have hurt, but no one can say exactly how much.
   Sanctions have shut off loans from internatonal lending
agencies, and more than half of the 300 U.S. companies that did
business in South Africa five years ago have left.
   The ANC, the main black opposition group, wants sanctions to
continue as a way to keep pressure on the government, but plans to
review its policy in light of de Klerk's reforms and the worsening
economy.

<HEAD>Low Cholesterol Steaks From Cattle Brought by Columbus</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe Columbus didn't really
discover America - the locals met him on the beach - but he brought
a hedge against cholesterol 500 years before everybody started
worrying about it.
   Argentine ranchers believe criollos, descendants of the hardy
cattle Columbus carried across the sea, can be the basis of new
crossbreeds that will produce leaner steaks for a diet-conscious
age.
   ``Columbus brought the first cattle to the New World on his
second voyage in 1493, and more on his third and fourth trips,''
said Dr. Sol L. Rabasa, a genetecist.
   ``You can accurately say the animals that subsequently populated
the Americas, from the Texas longhorn in the north to what we call
criollo cattle in Latin America, are their direct descendants.''
   Rabasa is president of the 6-year-old Argentine Criollo Cattle
Breeders Association, which is rescuing criollos from
near-extinction, and breeds them on his ranch near Villa Canas, 185
miles west of Buenos Aires.
   He said the criollo and its crossbreeds convert food to muscle
efficiently and produce leaner meat with less marbled fat.
   The Spanish word criollo is used throughout Latin America to
denote people or animals born in the Americas of European
parentage.
   Despite nearly five centuries of independent development, Rabasa
said, the Texas longhorn and Argentine criollo have the same long,
angular, short-haired body and the same colors - brown, red or
piebald.
   Carlos E. Dawney, a rancher and association officer, said the
only real difference is in the horns that give the Texas breed its
name - ``often 60 inches from tip to tip, longer than ours.''
   Rabasa believes Columbus chose the cattle from the arid regions
near Spain's southern ports, selecting animals that were ``gentle
for easy handling and hardy to stand the long trip in cramped
quarters.''
   They were used to establish breeding herds on Cuba and Hispanola
in the Caribbean. From there, they were taken to Mexico, the
Isthmus of Panama and to Peru for distribution through Spain's
South American colonies.
   Criollos arrived in Argentina in the mid-1500s and soon
multiplied into tens of thousands on the pampa, one of the world's
finest natural grazing lands.
   Argentina exported hides, but there was no way to preserve meat
for export and most of it was left to rot.
   Faster ships and use of salt as a preservative made ranching
highly profitable by the 1830s. To boost production, cattlemen
imported such faster-growing British breeds as the Hereford,
shorthorn and Aberdeen Angus.
   Zebu breeds from India, slow-growing and tough but resistant to
heat and disease, were introduced in semitropical northern
Argentina.
   Soon the criollo was seen as inferior and began to disappear,
absorbed by the herds of newcomers or banished to the least
hospitable areas.
   Rabasa, 75, is a former university rector noted for research. He
became interested in the criollo's potential 20 years ago when
ranchers asked him about the possibility of crossing it with Zebu
cattle.
   ``I had to tell them I didn't know, and we set out to find some
evidence,'' he said in an interview.
   A herd of Zebu-criollo crossbreeds was discovered on a ranch in
northwest Chaco province, and ``we found their production levels
and meat quality were surprisingly good,'' Rabasa said.
   Years of research by Rabasa and the National Institute of
Agricultural Technology followed, crossing the criollo with Zebu
and British breeds.
   Studies showed the criollo still had the gentleness prized by
Columbus, combined with superior fertility, body structure that
facilitates calving, resistance to disease and good milk
production, Rabasa said.
   ``The criollo calf gets up as soon as it is born and begins to
drink its mother's milk, allowing the mother to pass more of her
protective antibodies on to the calf during the first 24 hours,''
he said. ``The other breeds are slower to react and their calves
receive fewer antibodies.''
   Skin and eye pigmentation protect criollos and their crossbreeds
from cancers, conjunctivitis and other ailments provoked by the
bright sunlight prevalent in much of the Americas, the geneticist
said.
   Criollos also need water less often and can spend more time
searching for food over a larger area, making them ideal for
marginal land.
   Rabasa and his associates began a search for pure criollos
remaining in Argentina.
   They found them in pockets of the arid, thorn-forested Chaco and
in La Rioja, a desert province. A wild herd turned up in the
Glaciers National Park of southern Patagonia's Andean foothills
about 185 miles from the Strait of Magellan.
   Registered criollo cattle now number between 1,000 and 2,000 and
about 50 commercial herds use them as breeding stock.
   Rabasa said efforts to preserve criollo cattle are under way in
other countries, including the United States, ``where a gread deal
is being done.''

<HEAD>Farmers Join U.N. Project for Alternative Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   LA ASUNTA, Bolivia (AP)- The coca boom is over and Armando
Chavez is learning to grow something else.
   Chavez, an Aymara Indian, is one of thousands of farmers in this
remote Andean region who are making the transition to coffee,
fruit, soybeans and other crops with the help of a U.N. project.
   He said the program ``is like a dream to us. Now we have
advisers, fertilizer and insecticies. They have introduced
soybeans, built schools and roads. If the project left the area, we
would be like orphans.''
   The U.N. project is the cornerstone of a Bolivian government
effort to wean farmers away from coca, the base of cocaine.
   ``Our purpose is to change the illicit economy created by the
coca-cocaine axis (and) enable farmers to diversify their crops,''
Oswaldo Antezana, undersecretary of the interior for alternative
development, said in an interview. ``Before, farmers were
antagonistic.''
   Chavez, 39, his wife and four children live in an adobe hut on a
tree-covered hill outside La Asunta, a town of dirt streets and
more tin-roofed adobe huts. It is near the Yungas, a coca-producing
region in the subtropical Andean foothills east of La Paz.
   A four-wheel-drive vehicle needs seven hours to cover the 150
miles from La Paz to La Asunta. The narrow road runs along sheer
cliffs hundreds of feet above cascading rivers that feed the
Amazon.
   Farmers get from the road to fields across the chasms in
makeshift conveyances suspended from cables. Many of them suffer
from yellow fever or tuberculosis.
   When the cocaine boom began in the late 1970s, coca production
spread from the Yungas to La Asunta.
   Migrants from the highlands and the Yungas moved in, cleared the
forests and planted coca for sale to traffickers. The area became a
no man's land where outsiders, particular police, were not welcome.
   Chavez moved to La Asunta 11 years ago, hoping coca would
improve his lot. Then coca prices started down two years ago and he
decided to call it quits, because ``there is a law requiring the
reduction of coca and we cannot live only from coca.''
   ``When prices dropped below the cost of production, it wasn't
even worth harvesting the leaf,'' he said.
   Prices were driven down, in part, because of the Colombian
government's crackdown on cocaine traffickers last year and
increased interdiction activities in Bolivia.
   Chavez heads one of the seven community development centers in
La Asunta that receive financial and technical support from the
U.N. project. His center is introducing the raising of pigs and
fish, and the cultivation of coffee, soybeans, spices and fruit.
   Veterinarians, agronomists and health workers assist farmers
through the centers.
   Jairo Morales Nieto, chief tecnical adviser on the U.N. project,
said the centers are involved in product development, production
and marketing, as well as in training the farmers.
   ``In contrast to many other rural areas in Latin America, in
Bolivia there is a remarkably organized peasant social base'' and
peasant organizations have worked effectively for their members'
interests, he said.
   Farmers get a credit of $2,000 for every hectare - about 2{
acres - of coca they destroy. Loans, seeds and fertilizer are
provided as farmers progress in planting new crops and raising
animals.
   Because one of the main problems in remote regions has been
getting products to market, the U.N. project has financed new
roads.
   Two years ago, it took eight hours in good weather to travel
between La Asunta and Chulumani, a market town about 70 miles to
the south, and longer in the rain. Now it takes three hours.
   The U.N. Fund for Drug Abuse Control has spent $21 million on
the project, which has helped 150,000 farmers since it began in
1985. The money runs out this year, but the government hopes for an
extension.
   ``As long as coca cultivation increases in the region, there is
a greater possibility'' of cocaine traffickers and violence moving
in, said Arturo Villanueva, an adviser who showed visitors
experimental shrimp tanks financed by the project.
   An estimated 125,000 acres are devoted to coca cultivation in
Bolivia. The government hopes to cut that to about 30,000, which is
considered sufficient for the leaf's traditional applications.
   Coca is used as a medicine, in religious rituals, as a tea and
is chewed by farmers and miners to help counteract the effects of
high altitude and hunger.
   Two-thirds of Bolivian coca is grown in the Chapare, a flat
tropical region east of La Asunta. Both the United Nations and
United States are financing alternative development programs there,
but with less success than in La Asunta.
   Bolivian farmers have destroyed a record 20 percent of the
country's coca crop since October 1989.
   ``We have learned to establish a clear distinction between the
peasants and the drug dealers,'' said Morales Nieto, the U.N.
technical adviser. ``Generally, the peasants want to abide by the
law.''

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artisans are re-creating one of the great
moments of archaeology on an island south of Cairo.
   On Nov. 26, 1922, English archaeologist Howard Carter opened the
tomb of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamun and found a glittering world of
delicate statues, inlaid chests, feather-light fans and decorated
coffins of solid gold.
   The riches he discovered amazed the world.
   Now, 68 years after Carter peered into the small tomb in
southern Egypt, the artisans are fashioning Tut's netherworld once
again, working from photographs and other records. The replicas of
Tut's treasures are to be entombed as the archaeologist saw them.
   Twenty-two artists, sculptors, engineers and university students
are rekindling craftsmanship unseen since the days of the Pharaohs.
   They are halfway through their assignment: to duplicate his
four-chambered tomb and 1,000 of the 1,703 Tut objects in the
Egyptian Museum, as they were left by priests 3,313 years ago and
the robbers who came later.
   Ever-watchful jackals, goddesses in sleek gowns, open-mouthed
lions and even the boy Pharaoh himself, out for a walk in thonged
sandals, cram the bustling workshop on Jacob's Island.
   A year from now, every day on Jacob's Island will be Nov. 26,
1922.
   Until then, people wanting to marvel at King Tut's storied world
must travel to the two places they have visited for decades: the
treasure hoard in Cairo's Egyptian Museum and his tomb, with the
mummy, 450 miles to the south, in the Valley of the Kings.
   ``It's the wonder that we must produce in our tomb - the shock,
which you don't feel when you see the objects away from the tomb,''
said Mahmoud Mabrouk, a sculptor and art professor who directs the
Jacob's Island project.
   ``We work as a team, just as the ancients did,'' he said.
   Novices think Tut's treasures were all of solid gold. There was
plenty of that, but there also were objects of wood, silver and
other metals, alabaster, ivory, leopard skins, leather, pottery and
gemstones.
   Decisions on whether to replicate individual items, big or
small, were based on whether they were important to history or to
art knowledge.
   The project is costing 1 million Egyptian pounds (almost
$360,000) and is the brainchild of former diplomat Hassan Ragab, an
entrepreneur who revived Egypt's extinct papyrus industry.
   In 1985 he opened his Pharaonic Village on Jacob's Island, where
tourists come to view life from the days of King Tut, but without
the boy Pharaoh himself.
   ``Dr. Ragab asked me to create a full-scale tomb with exact
copies of objects so that tourists would feel the wonder as Carter
felt it,'' Mabrouk said. ``The tomb was no problem, but nobody knew
how to make the objects. Everybody I talked with told me to refuse
the offer.''
   Mabrouk, who advises an international committee working to save
the Sphinx, said he accepted the challenge for two reasons.
   ``First, I wanted to enter the mind of the ancient artist,'' he
said. ``What kind of people were these, to create things so
beautiful, but things that would never be seen by the living?
   ``Today, we artists have exhibitions and everybody congratulates
us. Not these artists. Their creations were locked up with Tut.''
   The second reason harks back to Mabrouk's childhood.
   ``I was 12 when my brother and I saw the Tut collection in the
museum,'' he said. ``We were so happy, but we were sad. The objects
were beautiful, but nobody knew anything about them.''
   ``I want Egyptian youth to look back on their history with a
sense of pride, a sense of identity. It's an Arab problem that
Egyptians turn their backs on anything about the Pharaohs.''
   Mabrouk said he is astounded by the quality of Tut relics. ``We
had to start with the simplest items,'' he said. ``Once we mastered
the techniques, we could tackle the most difficult.''
   Reproduction has been made more difficult because objects in the
museum must be examined from behind glass and many Tut objects are
locked in storerooms. Books contain conflicting information, and
Mabrouk said many of Carter's notes are inaccurate.
   Even lowly artifacts proved tricky. A simple pair of sandals
took three months to reproduce.
   Many of the 50 alabaster items from the tomb were lovingly
worked with exquisite designs. Alabaster posed one of the toughest
challenges.
   ``We spent six months working in alabaster factories outside the
Valley of the Kings, just to see how to use the stone,'' Mabrouk
said. ``We finally made three simple vases, but even that took a
month.''
   Still to come are Tutankhamun's gold death mask and the
elaborately inlaid gold sarcophagus.
   ``Sometimes you just have to compromise,'' Mabrouk said. ``We'll
use gold-plated copper instead of gold, but the effect will be the
same.''

<HEAD>Milken, Bad Housing Numbers and More Bankruptcies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A running news story became an entry for the
history books this past week when a federal judge sentenced
junk-bond financier Michael Milken to 10 years in prison.
   Even though the former master of the universe for Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. probably will serve only a fraction of the term, the
severity of the judge's pronouncement punctuated the Milken tale
with an exclamation point.
   There should be no doubt in anyone's mind - nor in the minds of
those who study his case years from now - that this was a stunning
comeuppance.
   A man who had been portrayed by some as the most influential
financial figure of modern times got more jail time than some
hardened criminals.
   The unmistakable message from U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood,
just two years older than the 44-year-old Milken, was that
white-collar crime should not pay.
   Milken made more than $1 billion peddling high-yield junk bonds
for Drexel, and remains among the country's richest people even
after paying $600 million in fines and restitution as part of his
plea agreement to six felony charges.
   Despite his wealth, the Manhattan courtroom scene reduced the
larger-than-life Milken to more human proportions. It proved a
strange ending to an era of excess in the financial world.
   Once Milken found himself in the company of adoring elders in
the highest ranks of corporate America as he charted a course for
restructuring companies with huge amounts of debt. On Wednesday, he
was humbled in front of a contemporary judge, who said he had
misused his ``leadership position'' and should be ``removed from
society.''
   As the case was debated before and after the sentencing, Milken
was alternately praised by supporters as a wizard and blamed by
detractors for everything from Drexel's own collapse to the recent
downturn in the economy.
   But Judge Wood's sentence struck with a force that diluted the
celebrity and left just a man who would leave a wife and a family
and go to prison next March.
   Milken was not vindicated, as he had hoped he would be, and the
decade of greed that he symbolized seemed to be banished to the
dark past.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Housing Numbers Extend Slide</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It was a light, but characteristically depressing, week for
economic reports. The government said home building plunged 6
percent in October, extending the slide in the construction
business to nine months, the longest on record.
   Housing starts have sunk to the lowest level since the last
recession in 1982. Analysts said the industry was battered from two
sides by sagging consumer confidence and tight credit. Many said
the malaise would linger well into 1991.
   With the evidence of recession rising, so did the rhetoric from
Washington. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady urged regulators
not to overreact to the softening economy by discouraging banks
from making reasonable loans.
   ``Use some judgment. Apply some balance,'' he implored bank
examiners.
   Meanwhile, President Bush's chief economist, Michael Boskin,
exercised some damage control of his own after his boss used the
word ``downturn'' to describe the economy's shape. Boskin allowed
that current conditions were sluggish, but he said it would be
premature to declare a recession.
   There was no denying a recession on Wall Street, however. The
Securities Industry Association said profits in the business
totaled an anemic $200 million in the first six months of 1990 and
have deteriorated since.
   The trade group said the sum was ``not equivalent to a single
decent bond issue a few years ago.''

<HEAD>COMPANIES: Laventhol Files for Bankruptcy, Greyhound Plan Proposed</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, Laventhol &amp;
Horwath, sought refuge in bankrupcty court under fire from lawsuits
seeking damages from dissatisfied clients.
   Robert Levine, the firm's executive partner and chief executive
officer, said the Chapter 11 filing was prompted by ``a series of
tragic circumstances.''
   Among them was a $30 million payment to creditor banks last year
- of which only $18.5 million was covered by insurance - over an
audit for the Grabill Corp. of Chicago. Laventhol audits of Jim
Bakker's PTL ministry also ended up in court in North Carolina.
   The firm's problems were among the most severe in an industry
increasingly plagued by malpractice litigation. Laventhol said some
of its partners would continue servicing clients independently to
help pay off debts.
   In another Chapter 11 case, Greyhound Lines Inc. filed a plan of
reorganization with a Texas court that would erase the equity of
the current owners and issue new stock to the firm's unsecured
creditors. The plan also promised full repayment of secured bank
debt, real estate mortgages and bus leases.
   But the bus line must still satisfy its drivers, who have been
on strike since March and have protested their treatment to the
National Labor Relations Board. The drivers could propose a
reorganization plan of their own.
   CBS Inc. said it expected a loss in the fourth quarter and lower
earnings in 1991. The broadcasting company blamed the deteriorating
picture on the poor advertising climate and disappointing returns
from its expensive venture into sports programming.
   The disclosure of the projected loss came just before the
network went before affiliates to propose a reduction in the amount
of money it will pay local stations to carry national programming.

<HEAD>MANVILLE: Beginning of the End for Claimants</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A plan was proposed for restructuring the finances of the
Manville trust to try to meet claims by thousands of Americans made
sick by working with asbestos.
   The plan was aimed at resolving the fund's cash crisis and
breaking a logjam of asbestos claims in the courts. It proposes to
pump up the fund with more money and pay the neediest cases first.
   Asbestos, once considered a miracle fiber, caused thousands of
deaths from lung cancer and other ailments. The resulting lawsuits
sent several companies into bankruptcy court and clogged court
dockets nationwide.
   The $2.5 billion Manville trust was set up after Manville Corp.,
once the leading producer of asbestos, reorganized under bankruptcy
court supervision in 1988. Already, the trust has paid more than
$1.1 billion to settle about 23,000 claims, but faces another
130,000 cases.
   The restructuring plan, which must be reviewed by a judge and
will likely be appealed, requires Manville Corp. to provide an
additional $520 million to the fund over seven years. Claimants
would be paid based on the severity of their illnesses.
   Lawyers' fees - one of the most controversial elements of the
asbestos issue - would be capped at 25 percent of their clients'

   Even as Donald Trump struggled to keep control of his highly
leveraged Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, Steve Wynn was showing
off a beautiful hand at his Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.
   The Mirage turned a year old, and Wynn took the opportunity to
ballyhoo his first-year results, which ran about 50 percent above
projections. He said hotel revenues the first year would approach
$650 million.
   Between 25,000 and 45,000 people visit the Mirage daily,
surpassing Hoover Dam as the most popular attraction in Southern
Nevada.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time the current economic downturn runs
its course, some Wall Street analysts contend, it could shake up
the way many people think about American investments.
   For example, they suggest, just suppose that recession and a
change in attitudes toward the use of credit bring about a
long-lasting decline in interest rates.
   Bonds might lose their modern image as volatile securities and
return to something at least a little like the slow-and-stodgy days
of yore.
   Real estate, even with lower mortgage interest rates, might
emerge lacking some of the luster it acquired over the past two
decades as a prime beneficiary of an inflation-driven economy.
   Money-market mutual funds, Treasury bills, and other short-term
interest-bearing investments could also fade from their present
exalted status as their yields declined.
   As for stocks - well, just possibly they could flourish,
provided the business world was able to find and develop important
new sources of growth.
   Of course, all this is conjecture akin to a long-range weather
forecast, based on a series of assumptions and interpretations that
have not yet been tested by the course of real-world events.
   The prospect of a sustained drop in interest rates by itself is
far from an accepted idea.
   Still, visions of this sort serve at least one present purpose -
challenging any presumptions that the nation is simply going
through a down cycle that will reliably give way sooner or later to
a return of business-as-before on Wall Street.
   ``We argue that today's recession will complete the job that
began at the outset of the 1980s,'' says Robert J. Barbera,
economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in a current appraisal
of the outlook.
   ``Inflation collapsed after the economic downturns early in the
decade, but inflation psychology lingered. Debt usage - a bet that
inflation would return - thrived despite low inflation.
   ``High real short-term interest rates were necessary to contain
U.S. economic growth in a debt-addicted society. Today, however,
both borrowers and lenders are much more circumspect about the use
of debt.''
   Signs of at least a short-term drop in rates have lifted
investors' spirits of late, although that mood of optimism seemed
to be on hold in the past week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,527.23, down 23.02 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped .91 to
172.39; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.81 to 349.04, and the American Stock Exchange market
value index was down 1.62 at 295.90.
   In holiday-dampened activity, volume on the Big Board averaged
126.53 million shares a day, down from 163.55 million the week
before.
   To some observers, such as the economists S. Jay Levy and David
Levy in Chappaqua, N.Y., it won't be easy to get U.S. business
growing vigorously again even on the far side of the recession.
   ``The excesses of the 1980s are being paid for in the 1990s,''
the Levys declare. ``A decade's profligacy cannot be overcome
quickly.''
   Says Barbera: ``We completely agree with the idea that the
30-year debt cycle is ending and that attitudes about borrowing and
lending are going through a metamorphosis.
   ``But we are also confident that at some point, interest rate
declines will rekindle both borrowing and building before recession
turns into depression.
   ``Debt's demise promises an end to the artificially high real
short-term interest rates witnessed in the 1980s,'' he concludes.
``Long-term financial assets - stocks and bonds - will thrive in an
environment of sharply lower rates.''

<HEAD>Milken Could Reduce Term With Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the demise of junk bond financier Michael
Milken symbolizes an era gone sour, his cooperation with
prosecutors could lead to another round of high-profile Wall Street
cases, lawyers said.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, who sentenced Milken to an
unexpectedly harsh 10 years in prison and three years' probation,
held open the possibility of reducing the term to reward
cooperation.
   Milken associates said Thursday that the ex-head of junk bond
trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose ideas about debt
reshaped U.S. corporate finance in the 1980s, was devastated by the
sentence.
   Milken, 44, and his wife, Lori, returned to their home in the
Encino suburb of Los Angeles shortly after the sentencing Wednesday
in Manhattan federal court. They were said to be spending
Thanksgiving at home with their three children, aged 17, 14 and 9.
   Defense lawyers for Milkn subordinates at Drexel said they
believed the judge gave a stiff term partly to send a message about
the value of helping the government.
   ``She is communicating clearly to Michael and his attorneys that
if she is going to entertain the possibility of reducing sentence
he must completely and totally cooperate,'' said Aubrey Harwell
Jr., who represented a former Drexel trader who received immunity
from prosecution and testified against Milken.
   The sentence - if no reduction occurs - effectively means Milken
will spend a minimum of nearly seven years in jail and on
probation, denying him complete freedom until at least sometime in
1998.
   In a deal pleading guilty to six felony counts, Milken agreed to
respond truthfully to any questions posed by the government after
sentencing.
   Lawyers involved in the case said they expected prosecutors to
target corporate officials who dealt with Milken.
   ``One of the topics of conversation in the last 24 hours is that
if Michael completely and totally cooperates and provides
information on corporate chieftains connected to his work, this
sentence will be significantly reduced,'' said one defense lawyer,
who asked not to be named.
   The lawyer said he believe the government would ``start out by
gently pushing him, push him harder and harder and bring more
pressure to bear.''
   Milken's sentence is far stricter than any previous in Wall
Street's corruption scandals, which evolved largely from
information supplied by speculator Ivan Boesky, who received a
three-year prison term after settling insider trading charges.
   Dennis Levine, a former Drexel investment banker, got two years
after agreeing to return $12.6 million in illegal gains from
trading on inside information. Mergers specialist Martin Siegel,
who accepted suitcases of cash in exchange for inside information,
spent two months in prison.
   The main difference between those cases and Milken's, legal
experts agreed, is the three cooperated before sentencing, which
judges consider a mitigating factor, and Milken didn't.
   ``(Judge Wood) said in a subtle way that Boesky cooperated and
you didn't - how can you expect to get a sentence that's equal to
his?'' said Harry First, a law professor at New York University.
   Milken was involved in thousands of financings, mergers and
other transactions, and the government is known to have been
scrutinizing several deals. First said Milken and his attorneys now
must decide how much to help prosecutors.
   Martin Klein, a New York lawyer and friend of Milken's, called
Wood's offer of a sentence reduction in return for good cooperation
coercive.
   ``That assumes that he has anything to say,'' Klein said. ``This
whole idea of getting people to turn on others sets a bad precedent
in this country.''
   Milken must report to federal custody next March. No prison was
designated, but under federal guidelines Milken initially could not
go to a minimum-security camp because of the length of his term.
   Legal experts said he likely will be eligible for parole upon
serving one-third of his term. During probation, Wood required
1,800 hours of community service a year, or 34.6 hours a week.
   Milken's lawyers have 120 days to appeal the sentence through a
motion seeking reduction. A Milken spokesman would not say whether
a decision had been made. Milken had faced a maximum 28 years.
   Since Milken's crimes occurred before 1987, his sentencing was
not based on federal guidelines that specify punishment. But two
factors cited by the judge meriting a longer sentence under the
guidelines were Milken's position of authority and the commission
of crimes she said were hard to detect.
   Wood told the court anothr component of her decision was
Milken's behavior after Boesky's November 1986 plea deal with
authorities.
   She said Milken didn't directly order subordinates to destroy or
remove documents but ``communicated the advisability of their doing
so in subtle terms that preserved some deniability on your part.''
   Wood said she did not accept government charges at a
pre-sentencing hearing last month that Milken committed insider
trading or manipulated a particular stock. That made the long
prison term more shocking to associates.
   ``She found for us on those issues,'' said a friend of Milken's,
who asked not to be named. ``If she found against us what would she
have done? Twenty-eight years?''

<TEXT>
   The Hong Kong government on Friday revised the
forecast for this British colony's gross domestic product in 1990
to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent predicted in August.
   It also revised the inflation rate to 9.7 percent from 9.5
percent.
   The government chief economist K. Y. Tang said the colony's
economy could have been harder hit by the slowdown in domestic
exports to the United States, Britain and Japan if not for
continued strong growth in re-exports.
   A government statement said domestic exports in the third
quarter continued to decline by about 2 percent in real terms over
a year earlier while imports rose about 12 percent in the same
period.
   However re-exports, goods assembled in Hong Kong of components
made elsewhere, increased by about 14 percent in the third quarter
over the same period in 1989, the statement said.

<HEAD>California-based Pharmaceutical Firm to Merge with Yugoslavian
Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's largest pharmaceutical
company agreed to merge with California-based SPI Pharmaceuticals
Inc. in one of the biggest East-West transactions in Yugoslavia
since World War II, SPI officials said.
   Under the agreement announced Thursday in Belgrade, the assets
of Galenika Pharmaceuticals would be transferred to a new joint
company, called ICN Galenika.
   The combined company is expected to have annual sales of $370
million.
   SPI will own 75 percent of the new company and Galenika will own
the remaining 25 percent, according to company officials. SPI is
based in Costa Mesa and is an 89 percent-owned subsidiary of ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc..
   The transaction will provide Galenika with capital to modernize
equipment and improve its international marketing position, the
company said.
   Galenika is the largest manufacturer of pharmaceutical and
chemical products in Yugoslavia and serves markets throughout
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Owned by the Yugoslavian government, Galenika will do an
estimated $230 million in sales this year and employs 5,800
workers.
   SPI has estimated 1990 sales of $140 million.
   ``We expect significant marketing synergies to occur from the
consolidation of our businesses,'' said Milan Panic, chairman and
chief executive officer of SPI and its parent, ICN Pharmaceuticals
Inc.
   The merger agreement is subject to final approval by the Federal
Secretariat for External Economic Relations of Yugoslavia and the
boards of SPI, its parent and Galenika.
   The consolidation was made possible by changes in Yugoslavian
law in late 1988 permitting privatization of government-owned
businesses, SPI said.

<HEAD>Government to Close 11 Coal Mines Over Two Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to fix typos. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven state-run coal mines will
be closed over the next two years under efforts to streamline
money-losing industries, the government says.
   Economics Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said Thursday that about
9,500 workers will be laid off at the mines, located mostly in the
Ostrava region about 240 miles east of Prague.
   Dlouhy said the mines are unprofitable, but have been kept open
to supply coal-fired electric power stations.
   Two major power stations and several smaller generators face
shutdown over the same two-year period to reduce pollution, Dlouhy
said.
   The 750-megawatt power shortfall resulting from the closures
would be covered by an expanding nuclear power program, he said.
Czechoslovakia already has two Soviet-designed nuclear plants in
operation and two under construction.
   A 440-megawatt reactor at the new Mohovce station is scheduled
to start up in 1991 and a 1,000-megawatt installation is slated to
begin operating in 1992 at Temelin, a new plant near the Austrian
border.
   Workers from the closed power stations will be relocated or
retrained, Dlouhy said.
   Miners in north Moravia have been on strike alert all week,
demanding better social conditions for themselves and their
families.
   Dlouhy said the mines and power stations would not be
dismantled, and could be reopened quickly if needed.
   Czechoslovakia and other East European nations are bracing for a
harsh winter because of reduced Soviet oil imports and higher crude
oil prices following the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Regular annual imports of 16 million tons of Soviet oil are
expected to drop to 12 million tons next year.

   Lloyds Bank PLC said Friday it has cut 2,000 staff
this year as part of an ongoing review of its banking operations.
   The cuts came mostly through natural attrition and early

   Lloyds, one of Britain's largest commercial banks, currently
employs 55,000.
   Further job cuts are expected in the future, but the exact

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday renewed its decree for a
capital gains tax, an issue which helped provoke a stock traders'
strike earlier this week, but postponed implementation for two
months.
   The Cabinet's action put off possible implementation of the tax
until Feb. 15. It had to renew the decree because without action,
the decree would have expired following Parliament's failure to
approve it within the mandatory two-month limit.
   The capital gains tax applies to small investors. Companies and
institutional investors already have to include capital gains on
stock trading in their corporate earnings. But individual investors
aren't required to include capital gains on their income tax
filings.
   Italian stock markets reopened Thursday following a four-day
strike by floor traders.
   The floor traders opposed the proposed changes in the capital
gains tax because of the complicated way the tax would have been
collected and the much higher tax rate.
   The traders have also been protesting the government's slowness
in implementing long-awaited reforms expected to make the Italian
market more competitive internationally. The reforms concern
regulating public tender offers, securities trading companies and
insider trading.

<BYLINE>Tight Lending, Low Bank Earnings Might Blunt Any Effect of Lower
Rates</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve has allowed short-term
interest rates to fall moderately, but tight lending practices and
depressed bank earnings could delay the move's effect on the
economy.
   Normally, lower short-term interest rates take about a month to
show up in a lower prime rate, lower adjustable rate mortgages and
cheaper car loans, economists said. It might take another year to
18 months for lending activity to increase as more consumers decide
to buy new houses and cars.
   ``But interest rates are only one element of credit
availability. There's a credit crunch and homebuilders are having
trouble getting financing,'' said Bob Villanueva, chief economist
at the National Association of Home Builders.
   The Federal Reserve this past week confirmed what many borrowers
already knew. Banks, under pressure from regulators, have become
reluctant to make loans. Their caution has been chiefly aimed at
commercial real estate borrowers, but has also affected typically
safe large corporations and home buyers.
   Bankers and business owners complain that regulators are
overreacting to the savings and loan debacle and discouraging banks
from making reasonable loans.
   The Bush administration wants lower interest rates to mean
easier credit.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady this past week urged bank
examiners not to discourage banks from making loans.
   Also, an interest rate cut could move through the economy more
slowly if banks try to bolster their weak earnings by delaying a
cut in the prime rate and absorbing the lower federal funds rate.
The lower fed funds rate, without a corresponding cut in the prime,
increases the spread between the price banks pay for money and what
they charge to lend it.
   Another source of money for banks, certificates of deposit, have
yet to come down much.
   Moreover, some doubt the Fed has allowed short-term rates to
fall enough and say it should move more aggressively to
significantly strengthen the economy.
   ``The economy, which is certainly very sluggish right now, is
not going to burst out of the shoot because the Fed allowed the fed
funds rate to come down 25 hundredths of a percentage point in the
past few days,'' said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference
Board.
   In 25 basis-point increments, the Fed has lowered the federal
funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight
loans, twice in recent months, from 8 percent to 7{ percent.
   If the 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate is
translated into a half percentage point drop in the prime rate, the
effects could trickle into consumer loans within weeks, Goldstein
said.
   But for businesses to spring back to life and lead a resurgence
in economic growth ``is just whistling in the dark,'' he said.
   If the lower interest rates find their way to a lower prime rate
and is accompanied by easier lending practices by banks, a half
percentage point cut could lead to about 40,000 new housing units
in a quarter, Villanueva said.
   But a more meaningful and aggressive move to lower rates, rather
than allowing them to fall, would be difficult for the Fed.
   The dollar already has weakened severely on world currency
markets and if U.S. interest rates fall further, without
corresponding drops in Japan and Germany, the dollar would weaken
more.

   Ameritrust Corp., expecting a loss for the
year, announced Friday it had halved the dividend on the banking
company's common stock.
   Officials said they resorted to the cut - the first in the
company's 96-year history - mainly because of problem loans linked
to a lagging commercial real estate market.
   The Ameritrust board of directors declared a quarterly dividend
of 16 cents per common share, down from 32 cents per share in the
third quarter. The dividend is payable Dec. 10 to stockholders of
record Dec. 3.
   ``The board's decision to reduce the dividend on the common
stock was prudent in view of our expectations for financial
performance in the near-term and general economic conditions,''
said Craig R. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Ameritrust.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Ameritrust reported a loss of
$19 million. Smith did not say how large the fourth-quarter loss
was expected to be.
   Ameritrust spokeswoman Terry Taylor said Smith's recommendation
to cut the dividend was prompted by the size of this year's loss,
and was a part of an overall effort to cut costs.
   Ameritrust has more than 200 commercial banking offices in Ohio,
Indiana and Michigan, and a major trust subsidiary in Dallas.

<HEAD>Now the Good News: Inflation Fears Ebbing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With not much else to cheer about in the
economic news, Wall Street has grown much more optimistic in recent
weeks about the inflation outlook.
   In the forefront of the financial news, oil prices have fallen
of late from the peaks they reached after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. But beyond that, analysts see other trends they describe as
even more heartening.
   Some broad indexes of industrial commodity prices actually
reached their peaks for the year before the oil upsurge.
   In recent weeks these gauges of inflationary pressures have
declined steadily to their lowest levels since late last winter.
   ``The inflation picture is becoming less worrisome,'' said Jack
Lavery, director of global research at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``Energy
price increases are abating and are not spreading elsewhere. The
economy is too weak.''
   Amid this kind of encouragement, anxious talk about
``stagflation'' has died down in the financial world.
   A few months ago concern was rising that the economy was headed
for a spell of double trouble - little or no growth, combined with
persistent upward pressure on the cost of living.
   Operating under that script, the Federal Reserve would have
hardly any maneuvering room to try to counter either problem, since
a stimulative policy to counteract recession would only make
inflation worse, while a militant anti-inflation stand would deepen
the economic slump.
   Now, that perceived dilemma seems to have been resolved. Most
analysts agree that ebbing inflation has made it possible for the
Fed to adopt a less stringent approach in managing the supply of
money and credit in the economy.
   The shift has been cautious and gradual, reflecting a style that
has become familiar to Fed-watchers under the chairmanship of Alan
Greenspan.
   The central bank has made no move as yet to change the discount
rate, which has stood at 7 percent since it was raised to that
level on Feb. 24, 1989. In the past, the Fed has often used changes
in the discount rate - the charge it sets on loans to private
financial institutions - to signal important monetary-policy moves.
   In many analysts' view, Greenspan has been sticking with a
deliberate style in an effort to gain and keep the confidence of
bond traders that he won't let his guard down on inflation.
   The letup in inflation fears has helped to ease what some
observers view as a simplistic initial reaction to the sharp rise
in oil prices.
   ``Even if we knew for sure at what level oil prices will settle,
the consequences are not as predictable as might be imagined,''
said economists at H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co. of Boston in a recent
report on the subject.
   ``Inflation is a monetary phenomenon,'' they argue. ``No single
commodity can drive the prices of all commodities up. Only the
federal government, by depreciating the value of the currency, can
do that.
   ``Indeed, an energy price increase works the other way. By
absorbing a larger slice of the incomes of energy users, it makes
the existing prices of other commodities less affordable.
   ``If, however, government intervenes to ratify, or `monetize,'
an oil price increase, then inflation will result.''

   Share prices rallied to close sharply higher on
London's Stock Exchange Friday, managing to shrug off domestic and
international uncertainty.
   The market was buoyed by expectations that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's successor would cut Britain's 14 percent base
lending rate because of the pound's strength, dealers said.
   The Conservative Party is to vote on three leadership contenders
Tuesday. Thatcher announced her resignation Thursday.
   A shortage of stock also was a factor in Friday's rally, traders
said. They said fund mangers have been looking for quality stocks
to boost their portfolios before the end of the year.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
42.6 points, or 2 percent, at 2,170.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 40 points at
1,712.2. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 20.89 points to
close at 1,145.18.
   Volume was 478.8 million shares Friday, compared to 498.2

   Francis ``Buddy'' Kemp, president of NCNB Corp.,
died of brain cancer early Friday at his home. He was 50.
   Kemp had been chairman of NCNB Texas since July 1988 when the
Charlotte, N.C., banking company expanded into the state. He had
suffered from brain cancer for more than a year.
   ``We feel his absence intensely,'' said NCNB Chairman Hugh
McColl in a statement. ``We have lost someone who is very special
to us.''
   Kemp, a native of Reidsville, N.C., joined NCNB in 1967 as a
credit analyst and quickly advanced in the company. By 1972 he was
a senior vice president and National Division executive.
   Kemp was promoted to executive vice president in 1975, took over
the North Carolina Banking Group in 1977 and became president of
NCNB Corp. in October 1985.
   He relinquished his day-to-day responsibilities at NCNB in
November 1989 after undergoing brain surgery.
   Kemp is survived by his wife, Ginger, their children, Frank and
Elizabeth, and by a brother, David Kemp of Reidsville.
   The funeral service will be at Myers Park Presbyterian Church in
Charlotte on Monday, with a memorial service at the First
Presbyterian Church in Dallas.

   The pace of business had been expected to be very light anyway
on what is normally one of the quietest days of the year for the

   Soybean and corn futures prices advanced while

said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
   At one point, the January contract was up by more than 11 cents

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 miners in hardhats and coveralls
staged a noisy 90-minute demonstration in front of parliament
Friday demanding increased government subsidies for financially
troubled coal mines.
   A petition handed to the lower parliament house said a cut in
subsidies under the government's radical economic reforms has made
the mines unprofitable and cut the miners' living standards, the
state PAP news agency reported.
   The demonstrators also demanded talks with the government on
wages, PAP said.
   Miners, in a series of recent warning strikes, have demanded
twice the national average of 1.2 million zlotys, or $130, a month
in base pay.
   Traditionally in Poland, miners commanded much higher wages than
other workers because of the importance of their industry and the
difficult, dangerous working conditions.
   But Poland's post-Communist government wants to transform mining
into a profit-making industry, and huge government subsidies are
being cut back slowly while coal prices are allowed to rise.
   Many of the miners demonstrating were from the Communist-founded
OPZZ trade union federation. Leaders met with Mieczyslaw Gil, head
of the Solidarity-allied Citizens Parliamentary caucus, Senate
Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski and various deputies.
   Friday's protest came only two days before the country's first
popular presidential election. ``I don't think it's an accident,''
Gil said on state television.
   Rajmund Moric, head of the OPZZ mining union, said
representatives of parliament and the government would visit the
mining region of Silesia on Dec. 1.
   A 31-year-old miner, Ryszard Chojnowski, collapsed during the
demonstration and later died, PAP reported. The cause of death was
being investigated, the agency said.

<TEXT>
   Raul Gardini, the chemical tycoon who
advocates privatizing Italy's industry, is selling his stake in
Enimont and leaving the troubled chemical joint venture to the
state-controlled energy group ENI.
   Gardini, who had long sought to extend his control on Italy's
chemical business through a takeover of Enimont, said Thursday he
would sell his 40 percent stake for about $2.55 billion to Italy's
state energy group.
   The stock is being sold to Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, also
known as ENI.
   ENI already owns 40 percent of Enimont. Its bid to buy
Montedison's 40 percent stake and increase its holding to a
controlling 80 percent ended a bitter 18-month battle between
Gardini and ENI officials.
   ENI also offered to buy out minority shareholders to take
complete control of Enimont.
   Gardini, meanwhile, announced his resignation as chairman of
Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the key holding company of the
agro-industrial and chemical groups of the Ferruzzi family.
   A statement said Gardini was leaving for ``ideological reasons''
and would no longer ``participate in any Italian company or
business organization.''
   ENI and Montedison formed Enimont in 1989 in an effort to
restructure Italy's chemical industry, creating the world's 10th
largest chemical group with annual revenue of about $13.6 billion.
   But squabbling over industrial strategy and managerial control
doomed the effort.

   The government said Friday it would end
production of the boxey little car, fondly called a Trabi, that was
the staple of former East Germany's auto industry.
   About 10,000 Trabant cars will be delivered to Poland under an
existing agreement with the former East German government, the
German Economics Ministry added in a statement.
   The tiny Trabant, made of fiberglass, is almost comic in
comparison with the mighty Mercedes-Benz and BMW that race down
Germany's autobahns. The Trabant's top speed is around 62 mph.
   Trabis became famous when East German refugees drove them into
Bavaria as formerly closed borders began opening in September 1989.
They were also used by East Germans who fled into West Berlin the
night of Nov. 9, 1989, when the Berlin Wall was breached.
   Many former West Germans have bought used Trabis as keepsakes of
their former easern neighbors, while former East Germans have
purchased more luxurious Western models.

   Here is a sampling of interviews with shoppers across the United
States on the day after Thanksgiving, the unofficial beginning of
the Christmas sales season, as compiled by the AP staff:
   ---
   OMAHA, Neb. - Shoppers didn't budget their shopping time Friday
as they descended on department stores, but they budgeted their
dollars.
   ``Nintendo is one of my top favorites,'' said Robert Connor, 13,
who was playing a game at a display at a Sears store. ``They've got
a lot of new games. I like the graphics.''
   With five kids in the family, Connor's father, Dennis, said he's
cutting down on the number of video games he buys each year.
   ---
   CHICAGO - While combing the outdoor State Street mall,
37-year-old Wisconsin resident Jan Liss vowed not to buy computer
games for her three children.
   ``They're too addictive,'' she said. ``You get much more benefit
from buying them books.''
   ---
   BOSTON - Cold, wet shoppers trickled through Boston's Downtown
Crossing in search of good buys in this year's tight economy, which
has been particularly acute in New England.
   ``We've set a budget to work within and it's the same as last
year,'' said Jim Bryan, who brought his wife and three daughters in
from suburban Tyngsboro, Mass.
   The Jordan Marsh department store rejuvenated its Victorian
enchanted village complete with grand hotel, bear-inhabited
treehouse and bakery with authentic gingerbread scents piped in
from the store's real bakery.
   ``Stores that offer something more than another sale another day
will be the ones that do better this year,'' said store official
Robert Gottlieb.
   ---
   PHILADELPHIA - Shoppers arrived in the rain as downtown stores
opened. None said the gloomy economy and Persian Gulf uncertainty
would bring any changes in shopping habits.
   Kathy Smith of Dover, Del., brought her two teen-age daughters
and mother to The Gallery shopping mall downtown. The first thing
they did was buy four big shopping bags.
   ``One of my daughters asked for a drum set. But it's not
likely,'' Ms. Smith said.
   ---
   DEARBORN, Mich. - Barbara Palko said the clothing selection
isn't what she hoped it would be.
   ``We're havin difficulty finding the special gifts this year,''
she said. ``The gadgets are out there, the electronics, but you
know how you look for that special gift? We're disappointed this
year.''
   ---
   NEW YORK - Things might have been bonkers at Macy's and
Bloomingdale's, but the busy shopping day was just another Friday
along two of Manhattan's less upscale shopping strips.
   The stores along Canal Street and 14th Street, where merchants
peddle goods ranging from discount stereos to imitation Gucci bags,
were lacking crowds on a rainy day after Thanskgiving, although
business usually booms on these streets on weekends.
   The majority of shoppers along Canal Street adjoining the
Chinatown district were more interested in stores selling fresh
fish and vegetables.
   ---
   MOBILE, Ala. - Bob Ingram, manager of Springdale Plaza mall,
said he doesn't care about gloomy economic predictions in
``Philadelphia, New York or Chicago.''
   ``I've got merchants here who are going into the season with a
50 percent increase in sales. Why would they fall on their face
now?'' he asked.
   Across the street, Rod Taylor, who manages Mobile's Bel Air
Mall, said some people might wait until the last weekend to shop
because Christmas falls on a Tuesday.
   ---
   SECAUCUS, N.J. - The Calvin Klein outlet was having a hard time
competing with sales at surrounding factory discount outlets
Friday.
   ``Everyone's in other stores,'' said May Morales, a store
saleswoman at Secaucus' hodgepodge of discount stores in the shadow
of New York City. ``It's busy, but not that busy.''
   The outlet had its holiday sale last weekend, so it didn't have
any specials to pull in customers Friday, she said.
   ---
   DALLAS - Jesus Escobedo of San Antonio was visiting town with a
weekend touring group that watched pro football's Dallas Cowboys
thrash the Washington Redskins on Thanksgiving Day.
   He said he would spend about the same amount of money this
holiday season.
   ``I think a lot depends on your personal situation more than the
economy,'' Escobedo said. ``So I think about the same.''
   ---
   PORTLAND, Ore. - The economic and political gloom aren't making
a big dent in Karen Andrews' holiday budget.
   ``I'll be spending a little less than last year, but it's not
because of the economy or the Middle East,'' she said. ``It's
because I haven't paid last year's bills off yet.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Edge Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices edged lower Friday in light trading
in another shortened session.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond lost \ point, or $2.50
per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall,
edged up to 8.44 percent from 8.42 percent on Wednesday.
   Bond trading ended about two hours early on Wednesday in advance
the Thanksgiving holiday which closed the markets all day on
Thursday. Trading wound down early again on Friday as many traders
took a four-day weekend.
   Prices were pressured by increases in the energy futures
markets, where light sweet crude oil for December delivery was up
about $2 a barrel at $31.75 shortly after 2 p.m. EST when bond
trading closed.
   Bond prices are hurt by rising oil prices or other signs of
inflation.
   ``In the absence of any positive news, we are sagging just a
slight amount,'' said Steven A. Wood, economist for BankAmerica
Capital Markets Group in San Francisco.
   He said trading volume was so light in the post-holiday session
that many traders who showed up brought their families.
   ``There are probably as many children on our trading floor as
there are traders,'' Wood said.
   Next week, investors will get more evidence on the state of the
economy with the scheduled release of reports on durable goods
orders and leading economic indicators in October as well as a
revision of third-quarter gross national product data.
   Some analysts expect that the Federal Reserve will move to
encourage lower interest rates by the end of the year to stimulate
the economy.
   In addition, the Treasury plans to auction $12.25 billion in
two-year notes and $9 billion in five-year notes next week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities were unchanged to 1-16 point lower, intermediate
maturities slipped 5-32 point and long-term issues were down as
much as \ point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service
reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.11 to 1,173.88.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills held steady at 7.23 percent
as the discount was unchanged at 7.02 percent. Yields on six-month
bills held at 7.31 percent as the discount was unchanged at 6.97
percent. Yields on one-year bills edged up to 7.24 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 6.78 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7{ percent, the same as late Wednesday.
   The Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was
unavailable Friday because of the light dealings.

<HEAD>Money Supply Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Nov. 12, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,314.8 billion from $3,315.0 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,082.0 billion from $4,084.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $819.6 billion from $822.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 4.6 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.8 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,317.1 billion, a 3.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,090.1 billion, up 1.5 percent, while M1
rose 5.4 percent to an average of $820.2 billion.
   In other reports, the Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from
the Federal Reserve System at the discount window, excluding
extended credit, averaged $154 million a day in the week ended Nov.
21, down from $263 million the previous week.

<HEAD>Up on Fears of Bloodshed in Gulf, Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices shot up more than $2 a barrel Friday
as traders who were worrying about war in the Persian Gulf became
even more jittery over a threat of violence in the Soviet Union,
the world's largest oil producer.
   ``Gorbachev warned of bloodshed if the republics of the Soviet
Union broke up,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The Soviet president's comments, made at a Moscow news
conference, fueled the upward surge in a market that opened bullish
in response to oil prices that had risen Thursday in London on news
of a shutdown at a North Sea oil facility, she said.
   The facility was already being brought back on-line Friday, but
the higher London prices boosted opening oil futures in New York.
Crude traders then began focusing on war fears that were stirred up
by President Bush's Thanksgiving visit to U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia.
   Bush told the soldiers that they might soon have to provide the
solution to the Gulf crisis that began with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in August.
   ``It heightened the sense that the possibility for war is
strengthening,'' Hittle said.
   But volume was extremely light, as many participants were taking
a four-day weekend in observance of Thanksgiving, so analysts said
the market's big move was somewhat exaggerated.
   Ed Kevelson at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said traders were also
buying oil on the belief that the U.N. Security Council would soon
be contemplating a resolution that would authorize the use of
military force to push Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. The war fears
were further whipped up by news that the British were sending more
troops into the Gulf.
   ``People certainly don't want to be short going into next
week,'' Kevelson said.
   Light sweet crude oil settled at $31.90 per barrel, up $2.27,
for January delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
For the week, which was shortened by the market's closing on
Thanksgiving Day, crude for next-month delivery rose $2.53 a
barrel.
   The rising crude prices helped pull up futures contracts for
refined petroleum.
   Wholesale home heating oil was up 3.42 cents at 88.66 cents a
gallon on contracts for delivery in December. For the week,
next-month heating oil contracts were up 4.24 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 3.45 cents to 82.40 cents a
gallon on contracts for delivery in December. Next-month contracts
for unleaded gasoline were up 4.77 cents a gallon for the week.
   Natural gas prices fell .5 cent to $2.605 per 1,000 cubic feet
on contracts for January delivery. For the week, next-month natural
gas was up 37 cents.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Higher on Hopes of Soviet Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices advanced at the Chicago Board of Trade
Friday as a team of Soviet grain buyers prepared to come to this
country next week.
   On other markets, petroleum futures were sharply higher; metals
posted gains; cattle advanced; and pork futures were mostly lower.
   Renewed hopes of an emergency food deal with the Soviet Union
and a report that Brazil had reduced its planting by 15 percent
gave soybean futures enough of a jolt to send prices up by more
than 11 cents a bushel in early trading.
   ``There seems to be a consensus in the market that eventually
the Soviets and the U.S. will come to terms'' on emergency aid,
said Joel Karlin, a grain analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc.
   The Soviet team reportedly will be discussing export credits and
their country's long-term grain agreement with the United States.
How much attention will be given he Soviet Union's food needs for
this winter was not known.
   Corn futures tagged along with the soybean complex, but wheat
slumped lower.
   But some of the gains in soybean futures eroded due to
commercial selling.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.48} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2}
cents higher with December at $2.22{ a bushel; oats were } cent to
1\ cents higher with December at $1.08{ a bushel; and soybeans were
3 cents to 4} cents higher with January at $5.82 a bushel.
   The prospect of a U.N. Security Council vote next week on using
force to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait was the latest Persian
Gulf development to send petroleum futures sharply higher on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Prices opened higher following gains in London on Thanksgiving
Day, when the Merc was closed.
   The price gains were sustained because of the Persian Gulf
developments and the vague uncertainty produced by Margaret
Thatcher's announced resignation as prime minister of Great
Britain, said Brian Tagler, energy broker in New York with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Then late in the day came word from the British foreign office
that the U.N. Security Council may meet next week to take up the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 75 cents to $2.27 higher with the
January contract at $31.90 a barrel; heating oil was 2.10 cents to
4 cents higher with December at 88.66 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was 3.30 cents to 3.54 cents higher with December at 82.40
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork declined on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle got a boost from the futures market's steep discount to
cash prices and from stronger wholesale beef prices.
   Expectations for lower cash hog prices on Monday kept pork
futures under pressure.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .37 cent higher with the
December contract at 79.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
unchanged to .25 cent higher with January at 88.02 cents a pound;
live hogs were .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at
53.45 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .22 cent to .40
cent lower with February at 71.40 cents a pound.
   Platinum futures advanced sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange upon word of South African mine layoffs following months
of labor strife.
   Platinum gained $13.70 to $14.10 with January at $429.70 a troy
ounce.
   At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold advanced $4.60 to
$4.80 with December at $384.50 a troy ounce; silver was .5 cent to
.8 cent higher with December at $4.13 a troy ounce.

   Stock prices declined slightly Friday, turning
downward near the close of the quietest session in nearly four
years.
   The paucity of business, which was typical of a
post-Thanksgiving session on Wall Street, also stemmed from an
unspecified power problem at the New York Stock Exchange that
prompted a trading halt of more than an hour and a half.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.13 to
2,527.23, finishing the week with a net loss of 23.02 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by a narrow margin in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
650 up, 680 down and 559 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 63.35 million
shares, down from 140.66 million Wednesday and the lightest total
since a 48.86 million-share day on Dec. 26, 1986.
   Most stocks declined slightly in sparse early trading before
activity came to a halt on the NYSE at 9:40 a.m. EST, 10 minutes
after the opening bell.
   The exchange resumed operations at 11:15 a.m. EST.
   The pace of business had been expected to be very light anyway
on what is normally one of the quietest days of the year for the
financial world.
   Analysts also said those traders who were present drew little
inspiration from the oil markets, where prices rose sharply, and
the credit markets, where interest rates edged upward.
   The price of crude oil for January delivery rose about $2.35 a
barrel, to just under $32 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   In the bond market, prices of long-term government bonds showed
small losses, nudging their yields up to the 8.43 percent-8.44
percent range.
   Energy stocks managed only a mixed showing in spite of the jump
in oil prices. Exxon rose &rsqb; to 51&lsqb; and Texaco gained &lsqb; to 57&lsqb;, but
Chevron dropped \ to 68{ and Atlantic Richfield was down ~ at 125.
   MCA fell 3&lsqb; to 65&rsqb; in active trading on reports that the company
was nearing agreement on a merger deal with Matsushita Electrical
for a price below what some market participants had discussed.
   British stocks showed gains as investors assessed the political
outlook in the United Kingdom following Margaret Thatcher's
departure as prime minister. British Gas rose 2| to 47&rsqb; and British
Telecom 1| to 57&lsqb;.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 80.03 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.19 billion, or 0.18
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .34 to 172.39.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .97 to 369.71, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .93 at 315.10.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.27 to 349.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 295.90, up .32.

   Urging fur wearers to ``donate your dead'' and staging funeral
processions for animals, activists around the country attacked the
fur industry on Friday by taking to the streets on one of the
busiest shopping days of the year.
   From Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan to a posh Denver mall to
a shopping center in tiny Manchester, N.H., nearly 100 planned
demonstrations filled high-fashion shopping spots in what has
become an annual Christmas season ritual.
   The ``Fur Free Friday'' demonstrations held the day after
Thanksgiving come at a bad time for the fur industry. The shopping
season for retail stores is expected to be sluggish at best -
dampened by the faltering economy that many merchants fear will
keep buyers from spending on lavish gifts like mink coats.
   Protest organizers hailed what they called a growing awareness
of Americans against fur garments, but a light rain diminished the
size of Friday's largest march, in Manhattan, where police said
1,400 marchers participated vs. more than 2,000 last year.
   With organizers struggling to elicit loud chants from the crowd,
the two-block Manhattan march gained momentum as it proceeded down
Fifth Avenue.
   Led by a costumed grim reaper slowly banging a drum, two
marchers clad in skeleton outfits wheeled a cart crammed with furs
in what a placard called a ``free burial'' for those who would
``donate your dead.''
   ``Get a feel for fur - slam your fingers in a car door,'' mocked
another poster. Dangling at the end of hand-held stakes, stuffed
toy raccoons, seals and other cute furry creatures peeped above the
crowd.
   The New York protest was largely peaceful, except for a handful
of demonstrators who organizers asked to leave the march because
they ``were acting up'' by chanting offensive slogans, said Jane
Seidlitz, co-director of Animal Rights Mobilization, which
organized the demonstration.
   ``This is not a forum where we confront fur wearers,'' she said,
noting that the group discourages protesters from throwing paint or
slashing fur coats.
   Elsewhere in New York state, about 75 protesters from the Animal
Rights Action League demonstrated outside the Macy's and M. Solomon
stores in Colonie Center mall in suburban Albany.
   ``One of our messages is for people to open their hearts and
include the animals in their circle of compassion this holiday
season,'' said Charles Donath, the group's director.
   New York animal rights protesters also held demonstrations in
Niagara Falls, Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton.
   In Denver, animal rights activists from the Rocky Mountain
Humane Society planned a march and a rally at the swank new Cherry
Creek Mall in Denver.
   In a protest that was more symbolic than others, 16 people in
Manchester, N.H. demonstrated outside a busy shopping center that
has no furrier.
   In downtown Harrisburg, Pa., a costumed grim reaper led about 40
people chanting against the killing of animals for fur coats in an
annual ritual in front of the Strawberry Square shopping center.
   Organizers contended that their annual campaign against what
they call the inhumane killing of fur-bearing animals for luxury
garments has put a palatable dent in sales.
   They say that because of their movement, some of the biggest
department stores, including Nordstrom and Harrod's of London have
decided to disband their fur boutiques, and that some leading fur
makers are in financial trouble.
   Fur industry officials deny the protests have hurt sales and
point to what they call a 10 percent increase in sales of fur
products last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher in Very Thin Trading; Gold Jumps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly higher against major
foreign currencies Friday in extremely thin post-holiday trading.
   Gold prices rose sharply on strength in the oil markets and talk
of Middle East war. The precious metal jumped $4.80 a troy ounce to
$383.70 on the New York Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank
later quoted a bid of $383.75, up $4.60 a troy ounce.
   The dollar also rose, but modestly, in a thin trading session
that followed the Thanksgiving holiday. Analysts said traders
largely ignored a rise in oil prices and intensified fear of war in
the Persian Gulf.
   Heightening concerns about an armed confrontation in the Middle
East, President Bush declared Friday ``the world is getting tired''
of Iraq's continuing occupation of Kuwait and said he was closing
in on agreement for a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force
in the Persian Gulf.
   Traders speculated that senior-level currency investors who
ordinarily would have responded to such news had taken the day off
for a four-day weekend. Talk of war generally nudges up the value
of the dollar, which is usually viewed as relatively safe-haven
investment.
   ``Bush made some very very heavy statements today,'' said David
Marshall, senior currency analyst at MMS International Inc.
However, instead of being responsible for a sizable increase in the
value of the dollar the war talk ``accounts for a nearly $5 rise in
the price of gold, and oil went up as well.''
   The dollar lost a bit of ground against the yen in New York,
closing at 127.10 yen, down from Wednesday's 127.17. In Tokyo,
markets were closed for Labor Thanksgiving Day, a national holiday.
In London, the dollar was quoted at 127.35 Japanese yen, up from
Thursday's close of 127.13 yen in Tokyo.
   In New York, one pound cost $1.9668, less expensive than
Wednesday's $1.9670. In London, the British pound fell to $1.9670
from $1.9700 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.4860 German marks, up from 1.4770; 1.2600
Swiss francs, up from 1.2472; 5.0115 French francs, up from 4.9800;
1,115.50 Italian lire, up from 1,109.00, and 1.1602 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1582.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Thursday included: 1.4860 German marks, up from 1.4786; 1.2583
Swiss francs, up from 1.2490; 5.0075 French francs, up from 4.9890;
1.6760 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6670; 1,115.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,109.50; and 1.1592 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1602.
   In European metals trading, gold rose in London to a late bid of
$383.75 a troy ounce, up from $380.00 late Thursday. In Zurich, the
metal rose to a closing bid of $383.25 an ounce, up from $380.50
late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.16 an ounce to

<TEXT>
   About two years ago, Michael Milken had a chance
to plead guilty to a couple felony counts and end the government's
investigation before a single charge had ever been brought against
him. He didn't.
   Milken could have fought his case at trial, bearing the pressure
of lengthy public scrutiny but squarely confronting the
government's claims, which he and his defense lawyers maintained
were spurious. He didn't.
   The 44-year-old former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier
also could have spilled his guts long ago, naming names and winning
credit to earn a shorter sentence. He didn't do that either.
   Now critics are gloating that the junk bond whiz got his: 10
years in prison and three years of full-time community service.
Just as Watergate closed out the 1970s, Milken's punishment is
viewed as a headstone for the 1980s, the end of an era of greed.
   But while no one predicted the severity of the sentence handed
down last week by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, legal experts are
questioning Milken's strategy during his four-year confrontation
with the Justice Department.
   ``The lawyer has to follow the client's instructions,'' said
John J. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor. ``Milken
was not some wimp who was totally dependent on his lawyers' advice.
He knows his own personal calculus.
   ``I think he probably estimated he might have served two or
three years,'' Coffee said. ``Certainly no one predicted this as
the likely outcome. But a man who lives with junk bonds knows there
are risks out there.''
   The general post-mortem in the legal community is that Milken
and his high-priced defense team led by Arthur Liman may have
miscalculated at various points. Among them:
   -Balking at a deal with prosecutors about two years ago that
would have allowed Milken to plead guilty to two or three felony
counts. Milken sources contend the government wanted an admission
of insider trading, which Milken found unacceptable.
   -Loudly criticizing the government's investigation, indictment
and tactics, and trumpeting Milken's innocence. After the plea
deal, Liman argued strenuously that Milken was guilty only of
technical violations. In the end, Milken appeared to get little if
any credit for settling the case.
   -Pleading guilty to six felony counts - ``an unheard of
amount,'' Coffee said. Liman may have wrongly assumed the judge
would discount the number of counts if she found they were minor
breaches. But Wood sentenced Milken to consecutive two-year terms
on each of five counts. On count six, conspiracy, he got probation.
   -Letting the government raise additional charges before
sentencing. When the defense contested the claims and Wood couldn't
square the pictures, she held a hearing. The judge didn't find
Milken had committed the substantive charges, but she did find he
obstructed justice during the federal probe, a serious violation in
judges' eyes.
   -Delaying cooperation until after sentencing. Wood toughened the
sentence because Milken had not assisted the government. Milken
long had refused to cooperate. Now he faces a Catch-22: He has to
snitch to qualify for a reduction, but if his genuine assistance
proves of little value, he gets no credit.
   Milken's strategy did yield a few benefits. He avoided the
humiliation of a long trial that would have kept him and his family
in the public eye for years, and the government agreed to drop all
charges against his brother, Lowell.
   But several defense lawyers and legal scholars agreed that
Milken's approach during the four-year ordeal was indecisive.
   ``If you're going to rattle sabers you're better off going
through with it,'' said an attorney with a client involved in the
Milken case, who asked not to be named. ``If you're going to go in
and try to cooperate you do it in a quiet, meek way. If you're
going to grovel, you grovel.''
   Milken did none of those.
   ``You can't cooperate halfway,'' securities lawyer Ira Sorkin
said. ``Either you go 100 percent or zero. By saying you're really
sorry, feel terrible, you hurt people, but not telling the
government more - she perceived that as non-cooperation.''
   In fairness to Milken, the second-guessing is pinned to the
lengthy term, which no one had anticipated.
   ``There are all sorts of factors that went into that decision to
plead guilty that we will never know about,'' criminal defense
lawyer Judd Burstein said. ``You just can't look and say he made a
bad decision because he got 10 years.''
   Under his plea agreement, Milken now must answer any questions
posed by the government. Judge Wood said she would consider
reducing the sentence based on a recommendation from the government
praising Milken's cooperation.
   Under federal law, the defense has 120 days to request a
reduction in sentence. The U.S. Attorney's Office would have to
support the request if Milken were to have any chance for a quick
reduction.
   Before the government agrees to spring Milken early, he likely
would have to provide information leading to other indictments. A
main focus is expected to be fraud in the collapse of the nation's
savings and loans, which bought about $10 billion in risky
high-yield bonds from Drexel.
   Bringing other types of cases is expected to be more difficult
because federal law bars prosecution for crimes committed more than
five years ago, and many of the deals Milken already are older than
that. Congress last year extended the statute of limitations for
S&amp;Ls to 10 years.
   While 120 days isn't much time, Milken could file the motion to
reduce sentence and Judge Wood could delay it for months while he
cooperates. But that still might not be long enough to develop
enough cases to satisfy prosecutors.
   Milken's next choice is how much to cooperate.
   ``It sounds to me like she's laying out the red carpet for
him,'' said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern
Methodist University. ``How far down it he can go and how much good
it will do is very hard to predict.''
   ``All I've heard is he's not a tattletale type. It will go
against the grain for him,'' Bromberg said.
   ``Michael is a basically loyal human being,'' said a defense
lawyer for a former Drexel trader who testified against Milken.
``He has been very opposed to telling anything in regard to those
people with whom he has dealt.''
   Whatever Milken's cooperation produces, his sentence seemed to
satisfy those who viewed Milken as the embodiment of Wall Street
greed, despite a modest, generous lifestyle that contrasted with
that of his main accuser, inside trader Ivan Boesky.
   The handful of letters sent to the judge by people who don't
know Milken suggested life in prison or physical torture. Liman
said the requests ``would probably stagger the secret police of
totalitarian regimes.'' The anger toward Milken was great, but many
people on Wall Street said it was misdirected.
   ``He was this era's target,'' one defense lawyer said. ``We are
a society that likes to blame someone.''
   Said Sorkin: ``The only conclusion that can be drawn is that
there was greed before the 1980s and there will be greed after the
1980s. If you look at what the stock market was like in the first
40 years of this century, what Boesky and Milken and the rest of
them did would pale by comparison.''

   Consumers began a Christmas shopping season that many retailers
fear will be their worst in years due to the twin grinches of a
weak economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In keeping with a tradition that's as much a part of
Thanksgiving weekend as leftover turkey, shoppers queued early on
Friday, some standing outside in the rain before stores and malls
opened.
   By midmorning, many an aisle was crowded, from midtown
Manhattan's swank department stores to the State Street Mall in
Chicago to the shops that ring San Francisco's Union Square. But
many of the shoppers were only browsing, not buying.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal government opened fiscal 1991 with
a $31.5 billion deficit in October, the first month of what is
expected to be a record year for red ink, the Treasury Department
said.
   The budget gap was 21 percent higher than the $26.1 billion
deficit of October 1989. The increase reflects the buildup of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf and the escalation of the savings and
loan bailout, officials said Friday.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The New York Stock Exchange halted trading for
more than 90 minutes because of a power disruption at the nation's
largest stock market.
   The disruption Friday, which NYSE officials called the first in
recent memory, shut down the exchange at 9:41 a.m. EST, 11 minutes
into the start of trading. NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said
the problem was power-related but that the exchange hadn't
identified its exact cause.

   Urging fur wearers to ``donate your dead'' and staging funeral
processions for animals, activists around the country attacked the
fur industry by taking to the streets on one of the busiest
shopping days of the year.
   From Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan to a posh Denver mall to
a shopping center in tiny Manchester, N.H., nearly 100 planned
demonstrations filled high-fashion shopping spots Friday in what
has become an annual ritual.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - If you're singing the blues about the cost
of Christmas presents, be thankful your true love isn't asking for
the complete catalog of gifts in ``The Twelve Days of Christmas.''
   J. Patrick Bradley, that literal-minded chief economist at
Provident National Bank, has once again toted up the sales slip for
the items listed in the old carol, from a partridge in a pear tree
to twelve drummers drumming.
   This year's total: $15,231.72, up 4.34 percent from last year,
he said Friday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Thailand has agreed to legalize the import of
American and other foreign cigarettes. In exchange, the government
is ending its 18-month investigation of unfair trade charges
against the nation.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said announced the
actions Friday. The investigation, which could have led to U.S.
trade reprisals against Thailand, was in response to a 1989
petition by the U.S. Cigarette Export Association.

   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Raul Gardini, the chemical tycoon who
advocates privatizing Italy's industry, is selling his stake in
Enimont and leaving the troubled chemical joint venture to the
state-controlled energy group ENI.
   Gardini, who had long sought to extend his control on Italy's
chemical business through a takeover of Enimont, said Thursday he
would sell his 40 percent stake for about $2.55 billion to Italy's
state energy group.
   The stock is being sold to Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, also
known as ENI.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) - Major carmakers in Spain plan hundreds of
layoffs in coming months because of drooping sales. Economists say
the moves are a clear signal the nation's economy is slowing down.
   A spokeswoman for Germany's Volkswagen AG Spanish subsidiary,
SEAT SA, said Thursday that the company will cut production by 120
cars a day and lay off 700 temporary workers because of a sharp
decline in sales in Spain this year.

   DALLAS (AP) - Francis ``Buddy'' Kemp, president of NCNB Corp.,
died of brain cancer at his home. He was 50.
   Kemp had been chairman of NCNB Texas since July 1988 when the
Charlotte, N.C., banking company expanded into the state. He had
suffered from brain cancer for more than a year before his death
Friday.

<HEAD>Soviet Shortages Driving Soybean Futures</HEAD>

   Each day, it seems, there's an announcement about the Soviet
Union reaching agreement for food aid with another Western nation.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. farm sector watches these multibillion
dollar deals from outside, its nose pressed to the window.
   Yet, hope persists, despite repeated disappointments.
   ``The European Community can't provide soy oil and meal'' and
the United States is about the only source for these commodities
now, said Joel Karlin, a grain analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc.
   Wheat can be bought cheaply enough from Canada or Argentina, and
barley can be substituted for corn if the United States is cut out
of any extraordinary deals this fall with the Soviets.
   In the past month, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has arranged
for $10 billion in emergency food aid to help his country get
through the winter. As these deals were announced, corn and wheat
traders at the Chicago Board of Trade became more resigned to the
belief that there won't be much, if anything, left over for U.S.
exporters of these commodities.
   The Bush administration has indicated that it is looking for
liberalized emigration laws in the Soviet Union before it's willing
to talk export credits.
   Futures traders and grain analysts say they think Bush will be
more willing to help if Gorbachev is firmly lined up with the U.S.
in dealing with Iraq.
   This line of reasoning sent soybean prices sharply higher a week
ago before the meetings in Europe between Bush and Gorbachev. The
gains were quickly lost when no grain deal was announced, but
quickly went back up again when Gorbachev said the issue of force
should be decided by the U.N. Security Council.
   By week's end, prices were back up on reports that the Soviets
were about to codify liberalized emigration laws. Further, the
market began talking about the arrival in Washington on Monday of a
grain-buying team from the Soviet Union.
   How much this team will focus on long-term trade arrangements
and how much on immediate aid for this winter remains to be seen.
   ``There seems to be a concensus in the market that eventually
the Soviets and the U.S. will come to terms'' on emergency aid,
Karlin said.
   He noted that legislators and farm groups have become
increasingly vocal on the need to give agricultural exports a shot
in the arm.
   U.S. soy oil and meal presumably are on the Soviet shopping
list. Cooking oil is one among many food staples reported in
critically short supply there and soybean oil is about the cheapest
oil available. And abundant supplies of soy meal make it the
obvious choice for animal feed.
   Nonetheless, said Karlin, if the Soviets don't get credit, they
probably won't buy.
   ``So, if we don't so anything, we're going to be left behind,''
he said.
   Here are some weekly commodity price trends:
   Soybean futures prices moved higher while the grains declined at
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat for delivery in December settled Friday at $2.48} a
bushel, compared with $2.50\ a week earlier; December corn slipped
to $2.22{ a bushel from $2.25; December oats dropped to $1.08{ a
bushel from $1.11}; and January soybeans moved to $5.82 a bushel
from $5.78\.
   Beef futures moved higher while pork declined at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle for delivery in December settled at 79.35 cents a
pound compared with 79.05 cents a week earlier; January feeder
cattle advanced to 88.02 cents a pound from 87.70 cents; December
hogs dropped to 53.45 cents a pound from 53.70 cents; and frozen
pork bellies for February delivery declined to 71.40 cents a pound
from 72.12 cents.
   Gold moved higher while silver was essentially flat at the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   December gold settled at $384.50 a troy ounce, up from $379.80;
and silver dropped to $4.13 a troy ounce from $4.14.
   Petroleum futures prices moved higher at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Light sweet crude oil for delivery in January settled at $31.90
a barrel, compared with $30.64; December heating oil advanced to
88.66 cents a gallon from 84.42 cents; and heating oil settled at
82.40 cents a gallon, up from 77.63 cents.
