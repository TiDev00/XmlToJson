   Charlie Farrell, silent film star of
``Seventh Heaven'' and the TV father in the popular 1950s series
``My Little Margie,'' died Sunday of heart failure at age 87.
   Farrell leaped into stardom with a minor role in ``The Ten
Commandments.''
   It was in the 1927 silent ``Seventh Heaven'' that Farrell and
Janet Gaynor established themselves as the screen's top heartbeats.
``Seventh Heaven'' walked away with the best director and actress
Oscars at the first Academy Awards.
   Farrell played a widower father opposite Gale Storm on 150
episodes on television's ``My Little Margie.''
   His movie roles included ``Wings of Youth,'' ``Sandy,'' ``Old
Ironsides,'' ``The Rough Riders,'' ``Aggie Appleby'' and ``The
World is Ours.''
   Farrell retired from movies after making about 10 silents and
more than 40 talkies.
   Farrell and his actress-wife Virginia Valli, who died in
September 1968, worked with partner Ralph Bellamy to develop the
posh Palm Springs Racquet Club, which became a mecca for Hollywood
elite.
   Farrell was mayor of Palm Springs for six years, from 1948 to
1953, and he successfully fought efforts of gamblers intent on
moving into the area.

<HEAD>Studies: Experimental Drug Relieves AIDS Symptoms</HEAD>

   The experimental drug DDI can help AIDS patients
gain weight and feel better but can have severe, even
life-threatening side effects, according to two reports published
today.
   Many hoped the new medicine would be a less toxic alternative to
AZT, the only medicine approved for routine use against AIDS. A
major nationwide study is under way to see how DDI compares with
AZT in controlling the disease.
   The new, smaller studies confirm that DDI is promising, but also
caution that it can harm the pancreas and cause other painful
symptoms.
   ``There is some evidence that it inhibits the AIDS virus,'' said
Dr. Howard A. Liebman of Boston City Hospital, senior author of one
of the studies. ``The important question is: Will the spectrum of
toxicity prove to be the limiting factor of the drug? Will that
make it not any better than AZT and perhaps worse?''
   The two studies, conducted on small numbers of patients by
doctors at Boston City and the University of Rochester, were
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results were
similar to those of another preliminary study conducted at the
National Cancer Institute and published last July in Science.
   All three studies were so-called Phase I trials. They were
intended to determine the maximum dose that patients can tolerate,
not whether the medicine had an effect on their illness.
Nevertheless, the researchers found that many of the patients
clearly improved while taking DDI for a few weeks.
   In an editorial in the New England Journal, Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, director of AIDS work at the National Institutes of Health,
wrote that ``there certainly is a suggestion of short-term benefit
from DDI.''
   About 800 patients are enrolled in a major study that compares
DDI with AZT, or zidovudine. An additional 8,600 people who cannot
take AZT because of side effects or worsening symptoms are using
DDI in an unusual program that makes the drug available prior to
its formal approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
   In his editorial, Fauci predicted that the two latest reports
will stir up ``inevitable enthusiasm'' about the treatment. But he
added that doctors and patients should withhold judgment about DDI
until tests aimed at determining the drug's effectiveness in
fighting the virus are completed.
   The studies published today were directed by Drs. John S.
Lambert of Rochester and Timothy P. Cooley of Boston City and
involved a total of 71 patients.
   Many of the patients felt better or put on weight while taking
DDI. Virus levels fell, while the number of white blood cells _ the
infection-fighting cells that are destroyed by the AIDS virus _
increased.
   However, high doses of the drug caused a potentially fatal
pancreas inflammation and severe foot pain.
   Liebman, senior author of the Boston City study, said the
pancreas ailment often occurred after three or four months of DDI
treatment and frequently affected the sickest patients.
   ``Physicians have to be very alert to the toxicities,'' he said.
``A lot of physicians are not sensitive to this. They are just
happy to be able to give something to their patients.''
   Even if DDI turns out to be no better than AZT, it may still be
an alternative for some patients. AZT often loses its effectiveness
after a year or so of treatment, and it also suppresses the body's
ability to make new blood cells.

   In an academic study of the air time
television preachers devote to fund-raising and promotion, cited in
an Associated Press article March 16, the findings for Pat
Robertson's show were inflated by an overemphasis on special
telethon programs.
   The communications professor who conducted the study, Stephen
Winzenburg of Des Moines' Grand View College, said Robertson
devoted an average 44 percent of air time to fund-raising and
promotion. Robertson's organization says its record shows that the
Robertson programs on average devote 18 percent of air time to what
they regard as fund-raising and promotion.
   Winzenburg says a disproportionate concentration of telethon
programs among the Robertson programs he monitored may have skewed
the result. Two of the six Robertson shows he studied were telethon
programs.
   Winzenburg says the non-telethon Robertson shows he monitored
devoted an average 30 percent of air time to content he considered
to be fund-raising and promotion.

<HEAD>Co-Chairman of Joffrey Ballet Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-chairman of the troubled Joffrey Ballet
has resigned, The New York Times reported in Friday's editions.
   Anthony A. Bliss announced his resignation Thursday and told the
Times that David H. Murdock, the other co-chairman, had also
resigned, and that Frank W. Lynch, vice chairman of the board, had
either resigned or was about to.
   The three executives are said to be among those opposed to the
continuing directorship of Gerald Arpino, who founded the company
with the late Robert Joffrey.
   Arpino earlier this month resigned as artistic director of the
ballet and withdrew his works and Joffrey's from the ballet's
repertory. He quit after the Joffrey board of directors voted to
set up an operating committee that would run the company in place
of both Arpino and the 55-member board.
   But Arpino remains artistic director of the company's ballet
school. And negotiations are continuing on his future role in the
Joffrey.
   Arpino has been a dancer and choreographer with the modern
ballet company since its early days in the mid-1950s. However,
critics and dance buffs alike have often called his works
pedestrian instead of inspired, and without structure, purpose or
artistry.
   The Joffrey, like many dance companies, has financial problems.
Based in New York and Los Angeles, it faces a deficit of about $2
million.
   Murdock had agreed to close the deficit with gifts, loans and
fund-raising over three years, The New York Times previously
reported.

   Thomas Jefferson once ran a lottery to pay off
his personal debts, calling it a wonderful concept because ``it
lays taxation only on the willing.''
   Now, some members of Congress are talking about a national
lottery as a possible way to raise money without raising taxes,
especially after George Bush's campaign pledge: ``Read my lips, no
new taxes,''
   But visions of mega-jackpots aside, the very idea of a national
game seems like a bad gamble for states already in the lottery
business and for religious and social groups.
   ``We oppose the idea,'' said Michael Carr, director of the
Michigan lottery and head of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries. ``We would prefer the money stay in
the states. Clearly, it would be competition.''
   Lotto America, a 10-state group that pools its resources to
offer bigger jackpots, also views a national game as a bad bet.
   ``I don't think there's enough room in the marketplace,'' said
Jim Davey, director of the Oregon lottery and vice president of
Lotto America. ``A national lottery would significantly cut into
Lotto America sales. There's probably a limit on the disposable
income people have for gambling.''
   Lotteries are now a billion-dollar industry. Thirty-one states
and the District of Columbia offer games, and sales this year are
expected to top $20 billion _ four times what they were in 1982,
lottery officials say.
   Most states make a profit of 30 percent to 40 percent that is
earmarked for such things as education and aid to the elderly. And
some congressmen are itching to get in on the action.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate's No. 2 Republican,
said Tuesday a a national lottery was a possible revenue source to
plug into the federal budget.
   Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., plans to try again with a national
lottery bill he first suggested in 1985.
   Attempts at starting a national lottery have failed in the past,
in large part because Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, is adamantly opposed to them,
and his panel has jurisdiction in the House.
   Murphy's bill would return a share of the take to states selling
tickets. The congressman recognizes that any measure that lacks
such a provision ``doesn't have a chance,'' according to Mike
Johns, a staff member of the House labor standards subcomittee.
   But there are many opponents who see lotteries as a shell game
that tax the poor.
   ``A lottery is the sale of an illusion to poor people who view
it as the only possibility of breaking out of the cycle of poverty
they live in,'' said Weston Ware of the Baptist Christian Life
Commission in Texas. ``It's bad public policy, bad social policy
and bad moral policy.''
   Valerie Lorenz, executive director of the National Center for
Pathological Gambling in Baltimore, also thinks the idea is a bad
one.
   ``It is absolutely foolhardy to legalize any type of gambling
without studying the social and economic costs of promoting an
addictive process,'' she said. ``The government would be promoting
an addiction.''
   Still, the chance to win instant riches by buying a ticket has
gilt-edged appeal. And taxpayers are weary of shelling out more and
more to the government.
   ``The resistance to gambling in increasingly counterbalanced by
the desire not to pay more taxes,'' said Emory University history
professor Dan Carter.
   A 1984 Gallup Poll commissioned by the trade magazine Gaming and
Wagering Business found that 62 percent of Americans supported an
annual national game and 26 percent opposed it.
   But Paul Dworin, the magazine's publisher, said such sentiments
would not be enough to offset political realities.
   ``I don't think it has a chance,'' Dworin said. ``Will Utah
allow a national lottery to operate. Will some of the southern
states in the Bible Belt?''
   This wouldn't be the first Congress to try to hit the jackpot
with a quick fix.
   In 1776, the Continental Congress approved a lottery to raise
$10 million for George Washington's army. It was abandoned because
most colonists couldn't afford the $10 ticket and the ``wealthier
ones who were Tories had no desire to aid the rebellion,'' said
John Scarne in his ``Complete Guide to Gambling.''
   Lotteries also helped finance Ivy League schools such as
Harvard, Dartmouth and Princeton. But games were outlawed in the
19th century because many of them were fixed.
   New Hampshire reintroduced gambling in modern times with a
statewide sweepstakes in 1964 for public schools.
   But a lottery would have to rake in a lot of money to put a dent
in the $3.01 trillion national debt. A Congressional Research
Service study in 1985 said every American over age 16 would have to
spend $2,041 on the game to eliminate a deficit of $185 billion.
   And H. Roy Kaplan, an associate professor at the Florida
Institute of Technology, said the most optimistic estimates from a
lottery game would not be enough to cover the interest on the
national debt.
   ``In realistic terms, the national debt is unapproachable in
terms of a lottery's ability to diminish it,'' Kaplan said.

   Who steals William Wardham's work steals
art; who steals his raw materials, steals trash indeed.
   Wardham is the first artist-in-residence at San Francisco's huge
trash transfer station near Candlestick Park. He's happily been
welding metal scraps into more than half a dozen works already on
display near his work area.
   ``There is so much activity, so much history in this,'' the
48-year-old sculptor said, holding crumpled chrome that once was a
grocery cart. ``You immediately ask yourself how it got that way.
Was it crushed by a hydraulic press here in the yard, or did
something happen to the grocery cart?''
   Jacqueline Tripp, head of the program for Norcal Solid Waste
Systems Inc., said the goal is to get people to start thinking
about recycling to reduce the amount of garbage they generate.
   ``It's important to be aware of all the waste out there and that
some of it can be reclaimed,'' Tripp said. ``We have to find a
means to extend the life of our landfills.''
   Wardham says the smell bothers him occasionally, although the
2,000 tons of trash received every day is deodorized somewhat by a
bubble-gum smelling aerator that also controls dust with moisture.
   Tripp said Norcal plans to pay artists-in-residence an average
of $2,000 a month for a one- to six-month stint at the site where
trash is dumped and then shipped to landfills at other sites.
   Completed works will remain at the solid-waste transfer station
as part of a growing exhibit open to visitors, including school
children and civic leaders, according to Tripp.
   ``We renovated a building for an artist's studio right on site
here,'' she said. ``I think we'll see some interesting pieces of
art created.''
   Jo Hanson, a long-time conceptual artist who helps select
artists for the dump project, proposed it out of her love of
creating art from trash she found on the streets in front of her
San Francisco house.
   ``By bringing together the environment and art we're carrying a
message that will make people more thoughtful about materials,''
she said. ``There is an infinite supply of material here, both in
quantity and variety.''
   In 1970, Hanson said, she was sweeping the sidewalk in front of
her home when she ``began to see art in what was there, blowing
past me every day.''
   ``I've studied garbage in the streets of other big cities and
San Francisco has unique trash,'' she said. ``People don't hide
their private lives here.
   ``Just from the stuff on the sidewalks you can follow the
progress of some people's affairs, including their drug dealings
and sex lives.''
   Hanson and Wardham say working with used materials is more
challenging because the items have a history that can influence the
artist.
   ``You can do conceptual things that relate to where the trash
comes from and where it goes,'' Hanson said. ``Recently, I've begun
working with metal that has been run over in the streets enough to
make it into interesting shapes. There's an urban energy to the
pieces.''
   So far, Hanson has received 30 applicants from artists
interesting in working at the dump. ``I think we've always had a
more progressive outlook here,'' she said. ``This is just another
innovative art program.''

   Censorship ended with the fall of
Nicolae Ceausescu in December, but the opposition says state
control of television and major newspapers, and of newspaper
distribution, is just as effective.
   Spokesmen for independent news outlets and parties say telling
the opposition story is extremely difficult as Romania approaches
its first free elections in 44 years, scheduled for May 20.
   The chief target of criticism is the National Salvation Front,
which dominates the interim government and is suspected by many of
seeking to bring back a milder form of communism.
   Many ranking members of the Front, including interim President
Ion Iliescu, are former Communists who had been critical of
Ceausescu. Front leaders profess democratic ideals, including a
commitment to freedom of the press.
   The Human Rights Law Group, based in Washington, D.C., said
after a fact-finding tour in late April that many Romanians
believed the Front controlled the government.
   It said the Front's advantages ``are amplified by the
government's control of television, printing presses and newsprint,
distribution of national and opposition print media, international
communications networks, and air and ground transport.''
   ``There are widespread complaints that the newspapers
distributed by the government, especially those of opposition
parties and certain independent papers, often fail to reach their
destination, are not delivered promptly or are returned when they
could have been sold,'' the monitoring group said.
   Several journalists working for independent dailies or
opposition party papers echoed those concerns in recent interviews.
   On television, ``representatives of opposing political parties .
.. have three minutes to tell their story from scripts held in
their hand,'' said Petre Mihai Bacanu, president of the
4,000-member Independent Journalists Union.
   ``Mr. Iliescu could grin on the screen all day and nobody at the
television would mind,'' he said.
   Supporters of the Front say Iliescu and other senior officials
get more coverage because national leaders make more news than
obscure candidates for Parliament.
   Several journalists said even coverage of news events was biased
in the Front's favor.
   One example cited was a demonstration organized by the Liberal
Party at which the camera dwelt at length on barefooted gypsies in
the crowd. Most Romanians think of gypsies as idlers and thieves.
   Images of roses, flattering graphics and stirring music were
added to taped coverage of a Front rally, the journalists said.
   Distribution of independent or opposition daily newspapers was
one of the problems mentioned most often.
   Bacanu is a member of the group that publishes Romania Libera,
which has a circulation of 850,000 and is the largest paper
regularly critical of the government.
   He snorted when asked whether copies were reaching readers in
the provinces. ``People on the train simply throw them off,''
Becanu said.
   Gelu Netea, manager of the Liberal Party paper Vitorul, said
state trucking companies were run by ``neo-Communists,'' meaning
supporters of the Front, who did not honor contracts to deliver the
newspaper nationwide.
   In Bucharest, ``the press distributor regularly either doesn't
take our copies or only a small amount,'' Netea said during an
interview in his office. He gestured at stacks of newspapers
several days old.
   Other government companies with agreements to distribute 80,000
copies nationally ``will take only 40,000 on a given day and then
will wait up to five days to take them to newsstands,'' he said.
   Officials and supporters of the government denied the charges.
   Both sides agree the state-run presses, which turned out only a
half-dozen dailies in Ceausescu's day, are woefully inadequate for
printing the more than 700 newspapers now being published.
   Some typesetting machines at the central printing plant date
from the 1940s and much of the lead is melted in an antiquated
gas-fired furnace.
   ``Welcome to Gutenberg's era,'' a foreman on the printing floor
told a Western reporter who was touring the plant.

   It's mid-morning and publisher Robert Maxwell is
on the telephone lambasting someone about distribution problems in
Germany, or doing an interview with a London radio station.
   It's part of a hectic countdown to Friday when the 66-year-old
tycoon launches his latest venture, a pan-European weekly.
   Fired by a vision of a united Europe, he says he'll back the
newspaper, The European, for ``as long as Europe is around,'' and
rails against those skeptical about the viability of The European
as ``uninformed, biased scribblers.''
   With the crumbling of the East-West divide in Europe and moves
toward closer unity of the 12-nation European Community, Maxwell
believes The European is an idea whose time has come.
   ``The Europeans have ended their stupid nationalism,'' he says.
``We're in the business of uniting Europe.''
   ``There are no buts about this,'' Maxwell said in an interview
in his penthouse suite at Maxwell House, London headquarters of a
global publishing and communications empire spanning two dozen
countries.
   He's the new paper's owner, editor-in-chief, masthead designer
and owner of the company doing the color.
   ``I've taken on the role of editor-in-chief for this newspaper
because the Europeans want to have a guarantee that this isn't just
some perfidious Albion foisting a European newspaper on the natives
on the continent,'' he told the London radio station.
   ``And since I'm born in Czechoslovakia, speak a lot of European
languages and everyone knows I'm more patriotic than the natives of
this country, I'm virtually tailor-made for the job,'' he said.
   The 64-page English-language newspaper will have an initial
print run of 1 million copies Friday, selling in London for 84
cents each. Half in color, it has three sections: main news,
business and sports, and a 32-page tabloid lifestyle and arts
section called Elan.
   The theater listings include what's on from Amsterdam to Zagreb,
via Cluj, Romania. A dummy edition has front-page stories about
Europe from Moscow, Berlin and Paris, and inside are congratulatory
letters from, among others, Poland's Lech Walesa and Anglo-French
actress Charlotte Rampling.
   Actor Peter Ustinov writes a column, and the editorial staff of
100 includes some top names in European journalism. The paper is
being printed in London, Frankfurt, Roubaix in France, and near
Budapest in Hungary.
   Maxwell, Britain's second-biggest newspaper publisher after
Rupert Murdoch, is launching The European as part of the Mirror
Group Newspapers which he bought in 1984.
   He says he is spending $41 million on The European's launch and
guarantees advertisers sales of 225,000 copies weekly from July to
December, 60 percent in Britain. If sales are under 225,000,
advertisers get rebates. The break-even point, Maxwell says, is
300,000.
   The European enters a British market which, with 21 national
daily and Sunday newspapers, has never been more crowded.
   The boom results chiefly from the defeat of the printworkers'
unions, which were crushed by Murdoch and Maxwell to usher in the
high technology on which The European depends.
   Media analysts credit Maxwell with a brave new idea.
   But many question whether The European is viable only in English
and with two-thirds of its projected sales in Britain; whether it
can compete with established English-language papers in Europe,
such as The International Herald Tribune, The Wall Street Journal
Europe and The Financial Times, and whether it can attract vital
corporate advertising.
   And the question remains whether there are enough dedicated
Europeans.
   ``It's an admirable and rather heroic idea,'' says Eric de
Bellaigue, publishing analyst at the London brokerage Panmure
Gordon. ``But I would doubt if an awful lot of people are going to
see themselves at this stage as being European and identifying
automatically with something called The European.''
   It's ``a very good product in search of a market,'' says Alec
Kenny, media director of Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising.
   ``But you just have to wonder if there are enough people out
there in the market place who really want this sort of product,''
Kenny said in an interview.
   Raymond Snoddy, media correspondent of The Financial Times,
agrees.
   ``As a purely financial venture I wouldn't give many chances for
The European's longevity,'' Snoddy says. But Maxwell ``is committed
to making it a success and he might be prepared to back it
financially long enough until the perceptions of Europeans catch up
with his.''
   Maxwell, born Labji Hoch to Jewish peasant parents who died at
the hands of the Nazis, arrived in Britain penniless in 1940.
   A decorated World War II British officer, he has sat in
Parliament for the Labor Party. But he has never quite been
accepted by the British establishment, and rival publications mock
him as ``the bouncing Czech'' and a self-publicist.
   In 1987, in a blaze of publicity, Maxwell launched a new British
daily, The London Daily News, which folded after five months. But
with The European, Maxwell insists, he'll spend anything for it to
succeed.
   ``Mirror Group Newspapers makes a profit of $1.5 million a
week,'' he says. ``I suspect they will be able to sustain any
losses on The European for as long as Europe is around.''

   Check it out. The latest at the supermarket will
let customers become do-it-yourselfers at the checkout lane. Not
only for bagging.
   They will be able to run packaged products over a scanner and
weigh their own produce before going to a central cashier.
   But don't try to slip an extra can of peas or bunch of bananas
past the computer. A security system in the CheckRobot Inc. lanes
reverses the conveyer if any unscanned, unweighed or switched
product is placed on it.
   And a gentle electronic voice says ``please set the last item
aside and continue scanning.''
   The lanes were on display Wednesday on the final day of the
Washington, D.C.-based Food Marketing Institute's Supermarket
Industry Convention at McCormick Place.
   And Scott M. Sloan, vice president of marketing for CheckRobot,
said the benefits of the system, and a new cooperative marketing
agreement with IBM, should make it popular.
   ``It's rare that you'll find a piece of equipment in the food
industry that will address the retailer's greatest concern _ and
that's the labor shortage _ as well as address the single greatest
concern that their shoppers have _ and that's speed of checkout,''
Sloan said.
   The systems, on the market for about a year, are already
installed in 11 supermarkets, including locations in Ontario,
Canada, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida and Wisconsin. Other
installations are planned soon.
   Sloan said the lanes are easy to operate.
   ``You can go to a number of our sites and you can see ...
children ... scanning groceries while their mother's at the other
end bagging,'' he said.
   Stores can still provide baggers, and can decide how many cash
registers they want to use, but to get the financial benefit from
the machines, it's recommended that each cashier handle at least
three lines, Sloan said.
   A computer screen and two rows of buttons face the shopper
bringing groceries to the line. Prices of scanned products appear
on the screen, while anything that needs to be weighed is put on
the scanner surface, which is also a scale.
   Buttons have pictures of different kinds of produce, such as
grapes. Put the grapes on the scale and hit the button, and the
price is recorded.
   For more detailed lists, a button might say ``Fruit Screen,''
and a checkerboard of several varieties appear on the screen. A
touch of the right one registers the weight and price.
   All of this is done with or without a computer voice stating the
prices _ at the customer's discretion _ and with recorded video of
a woman to give some messages _ including ``Help is on the way''
for those who touch the ``Help'' square on the screen.
   A receipt at the end of the line is taken to the cashier for
payment.
   While saving labor costs is a selling point of the machines,
Sloan said the devices really will fill a void created by a
shortage of 16- to 24-year-old workers.
   Al Zack, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based United Food
and Commercial Workers union, which represents retail food
employees, said there's only a shortage because stores want too
many part-timers.
   He also predicted customer dissatisfaction with self-checkout,
and slow lines due to baffled shoppers.
   ``I don't think many customers consider it a convenience to do
the work for the store,'' he said.
   But Richard Honerkamp, chief financial officer of Deerfield
Beach, Fla.-based CheckRobot, said most customers have liked the
system, and checkout would be faster _ especially in non-peak hours
when stores often shut down most lanes.
   At each site, conventional lanes also operate.
   That's the way it must be, at least for now, said Kim Contos,
director of special projects for Pay Less Super Markets Inc., which
operates nine stores in Anderson and Lafayette, Ind.
   The chain's flagship store in Anderson is getting five automatic
lanes installed.
   ``We wouldn't convert a store entirely,'' Contos said. ``I don't
think any of us are ready for that in the immediate future.''

   Francois Mitterrand began his 10th year as France's
president this week with his popularity plummeting and his
political integrity under harsh attack in a new, best-selling
biography.
   Some political analysts predict Mitterrand's problems will
worsen in the coming months. Others suggest the Socialist president
will bounce back, as he has many times in an up-and-down, 45-year
political career.
   Recent public opinion polls show a dramatic drop in his
popularity. A survey by Sofres, a major polling firm, recorded a
12-point collapse from 61 to 53 percent in a single month, while a
poll by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper found only 39 percent of
respondents satisfied with Mitterrand's performance.
   ``Don't ever forget: Francois Mitterrand is an artist of
resurrection,'' says Franz-Olivier Geisbert, 41, author of the new,
unflattering biography. ``In 1980, he was finished. In 1981, he was
elected president of the Republic.''
   Geisbert, a prominent journalist who has worked for both leftist
and conservative publications, has been following Mitterrand's
career for years.
   His second book on Mitterrand, ``The President,'' is filled with
revealing anecdotes and interviews and conversations with
presidential advisers, ministers, opposition leaders, reporters,
and Mitterrand himself.
   Currently on the best-seller list, it strips away Mitterrand's
image as a lofty, high-principled statesman and depicts him instead
as a ruthless, scheming politician who ``squeezed aside principle
and ideology'' to carve out his place in history.
   ``Mitterrand has fascinated me for a long time,'' Geisbert
writes in the introduction. ``This man, in fact, is never the man
you think he is. He is both better and worse.''
   ``The whole Mitterrand is there, in this mix of electoral
cynicism and artistic haze. He does not let himself be burdened by
scruples when power is at stake,'' Geisbert writes.
   The book is a devastating behind-the-scenes look at how
Mitterrand, 73, exercises presidential power by manipulating
political allies and enemies.
   It chronicles his intense dislike of his longtime Socialist
rival Michel Rocard, whom he relegated to minor Cabinet posts until
attrition among his stalwarts forced him to name Rocard as premier
after Mitterrand's re-election in 1988 to a second seven-year term.
   The book also describes how Mitterrand cleverly engineered a
leftist coalition to beat Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1981. The
maneuver was doubly useful to Mitterrand. It led, ultimately, to
the decline of the Communist Party and fueled the rise of the
extreme-right National Front party, which has discredited and
divided conservative political factions ever since.
   Mitterrand's troubles have been making headlines for weeks.
Political analysts attribute them to several events, including the
amnesty of a former Socialist minister involved in a political
fund-raising scandal.
   After the Socialist Party congress in April turned into a mean
dogfight among contenders to the presidency (not vacant until
1995), Mitterrand descended into the arena and gave a rare
television interview trying to explain the mess. His efforts
appeared to make matters worse.
   The book also paints merciless portraits of some of Mitterrand's
closest aides. Jacques Attali, one of his most influential
advisers, emerges as insecure and ambitious. Former Premier Laurent
Fabius, once seen as Mitterrand's political heir, comes across as a
calculating, power-hungry ideologue.
   Analysts say Mitterrand's drop in popularity can be explained by
his loss of favor among voters with political sympathies on the
right. Many of these voters backed Mitterrand in 1988, viewing him
as a reassuring father figure, comparable to Charles de Gaulle, who
would work for the broad national interest.
   ``The key to his re-election was his ability to preserve
influence beyond the political and sociological boundaries of the
left,'' Eric Dupin said in Liberation.
   This loss of right-leaning voters has not been countered by an
increase of support from the left, such as young people and
blue-collar workers.
   ``Mitterrand is looking for the choke to get going again,''
headlined Liberation, a leftist daily. ``The Elysee (presidential
palace) seems to have run out of inspiration, and enthusiasm.''

   It was a math mistake everybody has made in a
checkbook, but in this case it caused the Hubble Space Telescope to
miss its target by trillions of miles.
   Somebody added when he should have subtracted. Or vice versa.
   Embarrassed NASA scientists gave that explanation Wednesday for
the failure of the telescope to find two bright stars. The
telescope missed its target by one-half degree _ about the width of
a full moon as seen from Earth.
   ``When we were trying to point the telescope to the center of a
pretty rich star field with a high probability of acquisition we
were really off to one side of that,'' said Jean Olivier, deputy
manager of the Hubble project for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   Because of the math error and other problems, scientists won't
be able to take the first star pictures with the telescope until
next week, NASA said. When the Hubble was launched from the space
shuttle Discovery on April 25, they expected the first picture
within a week.
   In the latest glitch, the telescope was looking for two stars of
a certain brightness in the star cluster, but failed. Such guide
stars are necessary to tell the telescope precisely where it is
pointing; without them it is disoriented.
   Astronomers relied on star charts made in the 1950s when they
designed pointing instructions for the telescope, Olivier said. But
the stars have moved since then from Earth's vantage point. The
mistake was made when the scientists factored in the extent of that
movement.
   They corrected in the wrong direction.
   ``Instead of subtracting it they added it or vice versa,''
Olivier said.
   ``Instead of going from 18 arc minutes back to zero we went from
18 to 36 or close to 37,'' he said. ``That was the fundamental
problem.''
   In the language of astronomers, an arc minute is one-sixtieth of
a degree in the 360-degree pie that makes up a circle.
   The mathematical error threw the telescope's aim off by a
half-degree.
   ``For several days we didn't understand what the problem was and
we were thinking we maybe had some problem with the onboard system
alignment or the onboard function of the fine guidance system,''
Olivier said. ``Now we can take corrective action and point in the
right direction.''
   Engineers still are puzzled by a slight jitter in the telescope
when it is commanded to roll and by some unwanted motion as the
instrument moves from the shadow of Earth into the sunlight. But
they are going ahead with focusing tests and other planned setup
activities.
   To date more than $2.1 billion has been spent on the telescope
and ground facilities. The Hubble has been ready for launch since
1985, maintained at a cost of $7 million a month. Hundreds of
engineers and astronomers have been involved in planning for the
telescope's 15-year mission.
   ``In hindsight you look at it and say how could we have done
that,'' Olivier said of the error. ``But going into it, even though
it might have been something staring us in the face, it was not
obvious to many of us that we had this problem.''
   He added:
   ``I don't know how to explain it ... we made a mistake of about
a half-degree and it wasn't caught by many people who worked the
problem over the past many years.
   ``What else can I say?'' Olivier said.

   A T-shirt protest against a
government decision to let Sikhs in the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police wear turbans with their uniforms has angered human rights
advocates.
   Gerhard Neufahrt of Harrison Hot Springs produced 100 T-shirts
emblazoned ``Oh, Oh, Canada'' and showing five Mounties: one
wearing a stetson, one a turban, one with braids, one in a veil and
one wearing a Viking helmet with horns. He said the purpose was
protest rather than profit.
   ``It's designed to tell politicians they have made a mockery of
our history and culture,'' said Neufahrt. ``There is nothing racial
about the T-shirt and I have nothing against Sikhs.''
   Leaders of the British Columbia Human Rights Coalition disagreed.
   ``It's disgustingly clear, and we will be deciding soon what to
do about it,'' said coalition official Susan O'Donnell.
   Aspiring Mountie Baltej Dhillon, 23, dismissed the T-shirt as a
money-making ploy that preyed on emotions.
   ``And I am not suprised that polls show people don't like
turbans as part of the uniform, especially with this kind of
message,'' Dhillon said.
   In a recent Gallup poll on the issue, 68 percent of 1,049
respondents opposed letting Sikh Mounties wear their traditional
turbans, 22 percent were in favor and 10 percent had no opinion.
   Sikhs belong to a Hindu religious sect founded in northern India
about 500 years ago and have a tradition of distinguished service
in the military and police.

   Thirty years ago today, predominantly
Protestant West Virginia said yes to a Catholic and played a
pivotal role in the making of a president.
   When John F. Kennedy routed Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey in the
state's Democratic primary on May 10, 1960, he put to rest the
notion that a Catholic couldn't be president, experts said.
   ``It propelled John Kennedy to the nomination and undermined the
religious issue,'' said West Virginia Wesleyan professor Robert
Rupp, who is organizing a symposium Wednesday to discuss the role
of religion, the media and campaign techniques in what he calls
``The Primary That Made a President.''
   ``The West Virginia primary really was the difference in John
Kennedy's success or defeat,'' said Ted Sorensen, Kennedy's former
speechwriter.
   ``Given the handicap of his religion and to some extent the
handicap of his age, he knew he would not be the choice of bosses
in the back rooms. He had to win in the primaries and, above all,
he had to win in Protestant areas,'' Sorensen said Wednesday.
   Kennedy's advisers expected the worst from West Virginia, about
90 percent Protestant at the time, although Kennedy had won five of
nine earlier primaries.
   Kennedy beat Humphrey in West Virginia, 236,510 votes to 152,187.
   Although the vote made political history, West Virginia's people
and the grinding, inescapable poverty some of them lived in made a
lasting impression on the scion of a wealthy Massachusetts family.
   ``He had seen poverty before,'' Sorensen said. ``But the
long-term hardship faced by many of the people he met in West
Virginia, the look on their face and the stories they told made a
very deep impression on him. It wasn't a theory any longer.''
   Kennedy spent more time campaigning in West Virginia than
anywhere else. His advisers, supporters and family members hit
every chicken dinner, student rally and ladies' auxiliary meeting
they could.
   ``It was an exhausting campaign. We went to every hill and
hollow,'' Sorensen said.
   When he was asked about his Catholicism, Kennedy's standard
response was to talk about his family's military service, a
vote-swaying appeal in a state with a high percentage of soldiers,
sailors and airmen.
   ``He said, `Nobody asked my brother about his religion when he
died for his country in World War II,''' said Charles Peters, who
managed Kennedy's Kanawha County effort and is now editor of the
Washington Monthly.
   Kennedy also had Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., son of the most
popular president in West Virginia, on his side.
   ``That was as if God's son had said it's all right to vote for
this Catholic,'' Peters said.
   West Virginia Secretary of State Ken Hechler, a first-term
congressman at the time, was convinced Kennedy's religion would
cost him the state. He changed his mind after he saw the Kennedy
family in action.
   ``It impressed me so much that they, as a family team, knew
exactly what needed to be done without any kind of chitchat,''
Hechler said.
   The Kennedy and Humphrey campaigns differed markedly. Kennedy
chartered a plane at one point to fly to campaign stops; Humphrey
rode around in a bus. Kennedy's theme song was ``High Hopes'' by
Frank Sinatra; Humphrey had a folk singer.
   But the Kennedy high style didn't scare off the simple folk of
West Virginia.
   Peters said he advised against bringing Jacqueline Kennedy to
campaign in West Virginia.
   ``I thought she would come across as a snobbish, Northeast woman
who would contrast unfavorably with the down-to-earth Muriel
Humphrey,'' Peters said. ``Instead she was a big hit.''

<HEAD>Negotiations Yield Tentative Accord on Small Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Months of complex financial negotiations
between the United States and Iran produced a tentative, $105
million settlement of more than 2,000 U.S. small claims pending
since the 1979 Islamic revolution, the State Department says.
   The package deal also includes a tentative agreement to pay
$400,000 to settle 108 Iranian claims against the United States,
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday.
   The Bush administration repeatedly has declared it will make no
deals to secure the release of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon,
believed held by pro-Iranian militants, and that the claims
negotiations are not related to the hostage situation in any way.
   Nonetheless, the tentative accord on the small claims is a step
toward settling about $16 billion in larger claims that have been a
major irritant between Iran and the United States for a decade,
officials of both countries said in The Hague, Netherlands, site of
the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal.
   In Washington, a department official who commented on condition
of anonymity said he could not predict whether resolving the claims
issue will result in the release of hostages or was in any way
connected with the recent release of two captives.
   ``I have no way to speculate,'' the official said.
   The agreement covers 2,370 U.S. claims, government and private,
the department said, with $50 million going to private claims and
$55 million to U.S. government claims.
   U.S. officials in The Hague said an additional 400 or so claims
not before the tribunal also are covered.
   The actual text of the agreement on claims of up to $250,000
must still be written, signed and then ratified by the tribunal.
The panel was established under the 1981 Algiers Accord that won
the release of 52 Americans held captive at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran for 444 days.
   ``The proposed settlement is the result of many months of
effort,'' Boucher said, noting that negotiators discussed the issue
at meetings held almost every month since last April.
   He said it is not clear how long it will take to wrap up final
details of the tentative agreement.
   State Department officials have said repeatedly that there is no
link between the negotiations to settle the claims and the hostage
situation. They maintain that the talks at The Hague are not a
forum in which hostages are discussed.
   Boucher said that among the U.S. government claims now near
settlement are loans made to Iran by the Agency for International
Development. The private claims included those for private U.S.
property expropriated by Iran and for goods and services that were
delivered but never paid for.
   The big claims still outstanding involve mainly U.S. military
equipment for which Iran contracted but did not receive. After the
overthrow of Shah Reza Pahlavi, Iran in 1979 canceled contracts for
$9 billion in weapons, including four destroyers under construction
that were later taken over by the U.S. Navy.
   The Tehran government has since claimed $11 billion for
undelivered gear.
   Also outstanding are claims by major U.S. oil firms for
properties expropriated by the revolutionary government. The
companies have put that figure at $5 billion.
   Still pending as well is an American offer to voluntarily
compensate the families of persons killed in July 1988 when a U.S.
warship in the Persian Gulf shot down an Iranian airbus. Iran has
yet to accept the offer.
   The United States is represented at the claims talks by Abraham
Sofaer, the State Department's chief legal adviser.
   Dealing with major claims, the tribunal earlier awarded more
than $1.3 billion to American claimants and about $130 million to
Iranians, the State Department said.
   The tribunal also has ordered the return of $492 million in
Iranian funds held in escrow after bank claims against the money
are satisfied.

<HEAD>American Sets Off to Bicycle Length of Great Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners have ridden horses and danced
classical ballet atop China's Great Wall. Now, a California man has
set out to become the first person to bicycle from one end to the
other, some 3,700 miles.
   ``Like Mao said, you're not a man until you've reached the top
of the Great Wall,'' Kevin Foster said Wednesday.
   Maybe if the late revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung were still
around, Foster, a 30-year-old part-time actor from Ojai, Calif.,
might have gotten atop the wall sooner.
   He spent years trying to persuade Chinese authorities to approve
his plan, and several more trying to find financial sponsors in the
United States.
   The last hitches were smoothed out late last year, and Foster
boarded a train Wednesday for the western mountain pass where the
wall starts at Jiayuguan, 945 miles from Beijing. He will begin his
trek later this week.
   From there, the fragmented remains of the more than
2,000-year-old wall snake through desert and mountains before
reaching the sea at Shanhaiguan, east of Beijing.
   Over the years, the wall has attracted foreigners with strange
ideas. They have ridden horseback, danced ballet, performed
concerts and held cocktail parties on the wall, originally a symbol
of China's desire to keep out the world and now simply a symbol of
China.
   An Englishman ran the length of the wall in 1987. Others have
ridden bicycles beside it. But so far, despite hundreds of millions
of Chinese relying on bicycles as their only means of
transportation, no one has ridden a bicycle on top of the wall its
entire length.
   ``Everyone wants to be first at something,'' said Foster, who
said he got the idea as a child when he saw television coverage of
former President Nixon visiting the Great Wall in 1972.
   With his short, tousled ponytail, handlebar mustache and
hyperkinetic personality, Foster said his hosts at the Academy of
Science's Institute of Geography call him ``that crazy American.''
   Last November, he rode the New York subway system for 85
continuous hours to get into the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Riding the wall on his mountain bike, he risks broken bones and
axles. The wall never had an even surface, and the centuries have
not been kind. Many portions have steep stairs or slopes, others
have been reduced to rubble. In some places the wall has
disappeared altogether due to the ravages of invading armies,
weather and farmers who steal bricks for their homes.
   At those parts, Foster and his Chinese entourage will travel in
jeeps. In fact, Zhou Yu, one of two young staffers the Institute of
Georgraphy assigned to bicycle with Foster, said he thinks much of
the trip might best be made in jeeps.
   ``I know there are some parts we'll look at and say, there's no
way we can bicycle it. If we can just walk it, I want to walk.''
   The army has refused to let the group even drive near one long
stretch of the wall immediately west of Beijing because it is near
military installations. Instead, they will detour around the area
on train and resume bicycling at Beijing.
   From there to the sea, Foster said he expects the smoothest
biking because many sections have been renovated for tourists.
   The whole journey will take about seven weeks, Foster estimated.
It is costing him $20,000, the fee charged by the institute for
making all arrangements. Foster said he will pay it in part with
$15,000 he expects to receive from a U.S. helmet manufacturer for
wearing their product.
   ``I can't wait to get it done so I can get on with the rest of
my life,'' he said. ``I'm already planning my next project. It will
be even bigger.''

<HEAD>US Military Blamed for Civilian Deaths in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military failed to observe the laws
of war in an attack on a Panamanian installation last December and
dozens of civilians may have died as a result, a private human
rights group contends.
   A report made public Wednesday contended that both the U.S. and
Panamanian military violated international humanitarian law
governing armed conflict during the U.S. invasion of Panama five
months ago.
   The study was prepared by Americas Watch, which attempts to
promote protection of human rights in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
   ``Some 15,000 persons were left homeless in the attack, and a
very rough estimate is that 50-70 civilians were killed,'' the
study said. ``Many more were seriously wounded.''
   The attack took place on the Panama Defense Force headquarters,
situated in the midst of a poor Panamanian neighborhood called El
Chorrillo.
   The report gave little credence to allegations by some observers
that forces loyal to Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega were
responsible for fires that broke out in El Chorrillo and left
numerous civilian casualties.
   Noriega was ousted by the invading force and subsequently was
flown to the United States for trial on drug-trafficking charges.
   The study said U.S. military leaders were unable to cite
military necessity, such as the need for surprise, as a reason for
not informing the residents of El Chorrillo that an attack on the
headquarters was imminent.
   There was no immediate comment on the report from the Pentagon.
   In contrast to the Americas Watch report, Roman Catholic priests
at an El Chorrillo church estimated last January that about 20
people died in the neighborhood, many in a fire that was set by
retreating paramilitary supporters of Noriega. They said nearly
10,000 people sought refuge in the church and the school and a
nearby home for the elderly.
   The Rev. Javier Arteta said members of the paramilitary Dignity
Battalions bore much of the blame for the casualties. ``They came
out of their homes shooting in every direction,'' Arteta said,
adding that the U.S. military never fired in the direction of the
church.
   The Americas Watch report said the U.S. military failed to
follow the laws of war in refusing to free war prisoners upon the
cessation of hostilities.
   As for Noriega's forces, the report said they violated
international law by taking civilian hostages and by dressing as
civilians during the fighting, thus attracting fire and exposing
innocent people to combat.
   The study also said the U.S. Southern Command in Panama
undercounted the number of civilian deaths that resulted from the
fighting. The Pentagon total was 202, but the report said 300 is
``more likely the real figure.''
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark has estimated the
death toll in the 4,000-7,000 range, but the report said there was
no basis for such a finding.

   The Dukakis campaign stacked the audience for
the 1988 vice presidential debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan
Quayle and used a whip system to signal their partisans how to
react, a top campaign aide says.
   ``We told people when to cheer and when to applaud and when not
to,'' Thomas Donilon said Wednesday at a panel discussion sponsored
by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
   Donilon, who was a top adviser to the campaign of Democrat
Michael Dukakis, said people were flown to Omaha, Neb., for the
Oct. 5, 1988, debate between the two vice presidential nominees.
   He said controlling audience reaction was part of an effort to
``have an impact'' on the millions of people watching the debate on
television.
   Fellow panelist Charles Black, an adviser to the Bush campaign,
said the debates between the presidential and vice presidential
candidates were ``the most important single news events'' of the
campaign.
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., who was Democratic Party chairman during that
campaign, and Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was his Republican
counterpart, were present at the panel discussion and said they
were unaware of the Dukakis campaign's effort to manipulate the
audience.
   ``We're up there saying, `Quiet down,''' said Kirk, recalling
that both he and Fahrenkopf appealed to the audience to refrain
from loud responses to candidate statements.
   But their appeals were ignored as the audience appeared to react
spontaneously on several occasions.
   Asked if he thought the Dukakis campaign tactic was a ``dirty
trick,'' Donilon responded: ``I don't think it was a dirty trick at
all. We had tickets to give to our supporters.''
   But Donilon also conceded the tactic was ``not a good thing to
do.''
   Later, he said that he disclosed what was done to show how
easily debate audiences can be manipulated and to encourage the
commission to recommend that future debates be held without a live
audience in the auditorium.
   The commission transcript of the 1988 vice presidential debate
showed repeated audience response to Bentsen comments and virtually
none to remarks by Quayle.
   The loudest reaction, described in the transcript as ``prolonged
shouts and applause,'' came after Quayle compared his experience to
that of John F. Kennedy and Bentsen retorted, ``Senator, you are no
Jack Kennedy.''
   But that was not the only occasion when the audience reacted to
Bentsen remarks.
   After Quayle said he and presidential nominee George Bush had
``the environmental interest,'' Bentsen said, ``This late
conversion is interesting to me.'' The transcript said that remark
was followed by ``laughter and applause.''
   Partisans of both candidates reacted with what the transcript
described as ``cheering and booing'' when Quayle referred to the
``Jimmy Carter grain embargo.'' In late 1979, after the Soviet
Union sent troops into Afghanistan, Carter instituted an embargo on
grain sales to the communist nation, a move that was widely
criticized in the Farm Belt.
   Black argued against trying to force presidential campaigns to
adhere to a debate format set up by people outside the campaigns.
   He said the debates present ``the toughest, most important set
of tactical decisions'' of the campaign and ``it's absolutely
essential for each nominee to make those decisions.''
   ``We must run our own campaigns,'' Black said.

   The Environmental Protection Agency's
guidelines for what constitutes clean beach water need tightening,
says an engineer for an environmental organization.
   Diane M. Cameron of the Natural Resources Defense Council urged
a congressional panel Wednesday to set a ``zero health risk'' goal
for beach water.
   ``NRDC believes that EPA's recommendation of 19 cases of
gastroenteritis per 1,000 marine swimmers as the maximum acceptable
public health risk is clearly too high a threshold of risk,'' she
said in testimony submitted to the House Merchant Marine
subcommittee on oceanography and Great Lakes.
   ``Many states, including New York and Massachusetts, have
adopted EPA's swimmer health risk goal as their own, with the
result that many beaches deemed `safe' for swimming may actually be
laced with sufficient pathogens to make hundreds of people each day
sick with gastroenteritis and other diseases.''
   Cameron said a zero health risk is achievable because it doesn't
mean zero pathogens. She also suggested developing a ``bathing
beach water quality index,'' akin to the familiar ``air quality
index.''
   However, officials argued that the current system for testing
the cleanliness of beach water is adequate and that the federal
government should not trample on states' rights.
   EPA witness William R. Diamond said that ``in the past two
decades, programs to control water pollution established by (the
EPA) under the Clean Water Act have virtually eliminated the threat
of serious illness and disease from swimming at beaches.''
   Diamond, who is director of the agency's criteria and standards
division in the office of water regulations and standards, said the
EPA opposes a bill before the subcommittee which would set
mandatory guidelines for testing beach water.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., would require
the EPA to revise its criteria to ensure beach water testing on a
weekly basis at minimum.
   Currently, some states test their water less frequently, or
average the results of repeated tests.
   The bill would also require states to adopt the EPA's standards.
They now are voluntary unless a state adopts them as part of its
own water-quality program.
   James P. Burgess, an official with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration called Hughes' bill unnecessary because
current law covers ``a system by which EPA establishes national
water quality criteria and states develop state water quality
standards is already in place,''
   ``Second, NOAA believes that mandatory criteria and uniform
testing and monitoring procedures may be an unnecessary intrusion
by the federal government into the responsibilities of individual
states,'' he said.

<HEAD>IRS Admits Problems With Sting Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the IRS listened quietly as
members of Congress described one of his agency's undercover
operations as too unbelievable for Hollywood and an embarrassment
to the Keystone Kops.
   ``I'm not sure we have a different side,'' IRS Commissioner Fred
T. Goldberg Jr. began when asked for his side of the story. Some
aspects of the gambling operation ``were inadequate. Period. No
minced words,'' he admitted.
   That Las Vegas operation, known as Project Layoff, was an effort
by the agency to track down those who evade federal gaming taxes
and income taxes on their winnings.
   After 11 months of poor recordkeeping and difficulty collecting
from losers, the ``sting'' was shut down in 1985 after the lives of
IRS agents were threatened by illegal bookmakers.
   ``Any businessman in Las Vegas would be thrown in jail if his
books looked like Project Layoff's,'' Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.,
complained Wednesday to the House Government Operations consumer
subcommittee.
   ``The IRS would audit this firm and slap it with so many
penalties and so much interest that your hair would stand on end,''
said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
   Reid said the project cost taxpayers $600,000 and resulted in
only two prosecutions on minor charges. More important, he said,
conduct of the sting gave rise to speculation that IRS workers
could have skimmed some of the $22 million of bets that passed
through the operation.
   ``How many illegal bookmaking operations that did business with
the IRS (sting) were closed as a result?'' asked Rep. Doug Barnard
Jr., D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee.
   ``To my knowledge, there were none,'' said Inar Morics,
assistant IRS commissioner for criminal investigations.
   Goldberg said IRS planning, control and recordkeeping of the
operation, which ended four years before he took office, were
inadequate. Although he had little praise for the project, he said
the IRS will continue undercover operations, including an
occasional sting, as part of its fight against drugs, money
laundering and tax evasion.
   ``If we are going to do it, we've got to do it right,'' Goldberg
said. He acknowledged that would include seeking cooperation from
the FBI, as was done in the Project Layoff case, and from local
gaming authorities, which was not done.
   ``If we submitted Project Layoff as a TV script, it would be
rejected on the grounds that it is too unbelievable,'' Bryan said.
   ``It was a complete fiasco,'' said Rep. James Bilbray, D-Nev.
``No target was arrested.'' He said the IRS should get out of the
sting business.
   Some Republicans on the subcommittee said they were concerned
that failure of the Las Vegas project might slow the IRS fight
against drug dealers and organized crime.
   ``I hope there is no political pressure for you to lay off,''
said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.
   The House subcommittee investigated the project as part of a
long-term probe of misconduct among high-level IRS officials.
   Goldberg said the IRS erred in failing to conduct a timely
background check of a woman hired and later promoted in the
criminal-investigation division of the Milwaukee office. The woman
acknowledged later that she had been involved in illegal gambling.
   ``The controls which could have prevented the promotion from
occurring failed to operate effectively in this case,'' Goldberg
said.
   He said the IRS is investigating allegations that some IRS
employees in the Albany office have been the subject of retaliation
from superiors because the workers cooperated with subcommittee
investigators.
   ``We take these charges most seriously,'' Goldberg said. ``We
cannot and will not tolerate harassment and retaliation within our
agency.''

<HEAD>Pro Sports Executives See Coming Shift Toward Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TV sports fans don't have to worry about
paying to see the Super Bowl or World Series on the tube _ yet.
   But a panel of professional baseball, football and basketball
executives told a House subcommittee Wednesday that as costs rise
and network television viewership falls, teams will lean more
toward cable, particularly for local viewing of baseball.
   That doesn't mean viewers will have to pay $10 just to watch the
Super Bowl or the World Series, at least for the foreseeable
future. Network TV still commands the audiences and advertising
revenue to outbid cable TV for the major championship events, the
executives said.
   ``I am confident that for some time to come, free television
will remain the key method of distribution to our fans,'' National
Basketball Association Commissioner David J. Stern told the House
Energy and Commerce telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
``I do not anticipate any dramatic change in the number of NBA
games available on, or shifting of our key events away from, free
over-the-air television.''
   Stern, along with his counterparts in the National Football
League and Major League Baseball, said they could not foresee major
championship games going to pay-per-view cable before the year 2000.
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue repeated an earlier pledge that
the Super Bowl would not be offered on pay-cable in this decade.
   However, under questioning by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
Tagliabue and the other executives would not make the same
predictions for sports on so-called basic cable services.
   Tagliabue said it was ``extremely unlikely'' that the Super Bowl
would appear on basic cable in the next 10 years, but he couldn't
say what would happen to regular-season games.
   ``Beyond the next four years, it is difficult to speculate as to
the nature of NFL television arrangements,'' Tagliabue said.
   Stern said the NBA championship games were under contract to CBS
until 1997, but he would not predict what would happen after that
in light of statistics showing the three major networks' share of
the viewing audience has dropped from about 95 percent to about 65
percent in the past decade.
   ``I don't think you're going to see an increase in network''
shares of the audience, Stern added.
   Baseball Commissioner Francis T. Vincent Jr. said the issue was
not so much championship games, to which networks can attract large
audiences and therefore outbid cable, but in the broadcast of local
games.
   He said Chicago White Sox baseball recently went to national
cable superstation WGN when no local broadcasters would bid for the
rights. Vincent said that because of cable, baseball fans elsewhere
are seeing games they otherwise would not have had access to.

   Savings and loan financier Charles H. Keating
Jr. is defending the five senators who defended him _ whether they
like it or not.
   ``They should be congratulated,'' Keating said Wednesday in a
nationally televised luncheon at the National Press Club.
   The senators, now the target of a Senate Ethics Committee
investigation, met with savings and loan regulators in March 1987
on behalf of Keating and his institution, Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irvine, Calif.
   The five _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and John
McCain, R-Ariz. _ all had received political contributions from
Keating.
   Two years after the meeting, regulators seized Lincoln. They
estimated the cost to taxpayers for the failure at $2 billion.
Keating and his family are defendants in a $1.1 billion civil fraud
and racketeering suit brought by the government.
   Keating said he is not disappointed that the senators have since
tried to distance themselves from him.
   ``There's something wrong with the system and, from my
perspective, that's what the senators were trying to call attention
to. I think they did darn well,'' he said.
   Keating, in an emotional appearance in which he twice recited
poetry, proclaimed his innocence and blamed regulators' unjustified
and arbitrary writedown of Lincoln's assets for the S&amp;L's collapse.
He said he is broke and in danger of losing his house because he
hasn't paid his mortgage in four or five months.
   ``If I were the crook that they say I was and if I were the
greediest man in the world, by golly, you'd have to also call me
the most stupid because nothing that I supposedly took ... has
stuck to my palms or my children's,'' he said.
   Keating sharply criticized savings and loan bailout chief L.
William Seidman for his decision to cut the price on
difficult-to-sell S&amp;L real estate in the government's possession.
   ``He's sure doing his best to make a heckuva lot of people that
are rich get richer,'' he said, applauding a move by the Bush
administration to nudge Seidman from office.
   Seidman has dismissed Keating's contentions as ``full of
baloney'' and ``way off the mark.''
   The press club speech was part of the former S&amp;L executive's
campaign to portray himself as a legitimate businessman persecuted
by regulators.
   Last year, during the weekly House Banking Committee hearings
into Lincoln's failure, Keating refused to talk to reporters,
making his only comments in written statements.
   But in recent months he's made himself available for interviews.
On Tuesday night, he fielded questions from callers to a 90-minute
program on the C-SPAN cable television network.
   ``At this point I am trying to tell you my side of the story and
I do appreciate the fact that you're letting me do it,'' he told
reporters at the lunch.
   Keating has sued the government, seeking the return of his S&amp;L.
U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin is scheduled to hear closing
arguments in the case on June 8.

   The Bush administration is fighting the war on
drugs with rubber bullets and losing the battle to keep school
children from taking drugs, according to several members of a House
committee.
   ``Our young people are succumbing to this crisis in greater
numbers as the days go by, as both victims and victimizers,'' Rep.
Charles Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics
Abuse and Control, said Wednesday.
   ``An entire generation may be lost before we are finished with
the drug crisis,'' the New York Democrat said. ``Without the
support of the nation's leadership, the war on drugs will continue
to be fought with rubber bullets.''
   The attack on the administration's drug use-prevention policies
came as Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos touted two new anti-drug
initiatives: a model curriculum and a handbook for grappling with
drug and alcohol abuse on college campuses.
   Cavazos also outlined his department's efforts to monitor the
implementation of required new prevention programs and policies at
schools and colleges.
   Rangel complained that the strategy overlooks the needs of
school dropouts, as well as those of school-age drug abusers in
local and state jails and treatment centers.
   ``Quite frankly, Mr. Secretary, these studies are not helping at
all,'' Rangel told Cavazos. ``I am disappointed that we don't have
a federal treatment strategy. I'm disappointed that we don't have a
foreign policy strategy. In my community, I don't need to give a
model plan to the principal, nor do I need a handbook.''
   Rep. Bill Grant, R-Fla., said he too was ``frustrated by all
these studies.'' He said school children should be given
alternatives to using drugs and teachers should learn how to help
boost students' self-esteem.
   Rep. Joseph Brennan, D-Maine, said, ``I don't see any spirit,
passion from this administration to seriously do something'' about
drug abuse ``and some of the things I see are counterproductive.''
   Brennan criticized William Bennett, President Bush's drug policy
coordinator, for a recent statement that ``education is kind of a
helpful auxiliary, maybe it's something that's nice.''
   Cavazos refused to criticize Bennett but stressed ``education is
the only solution to drugs.''
   Other committee members criticized the administration's approach
to drug prevention in the schools. A few, however, praised the
department's handbooks and other literature used to tell students
about the dangers of taking drugs.
   ``Education is a critical component of our nation's
drug-prevention efforts and I want to commend you for your efforts
to date,'' said Rep. Larry Coughlin, R-Pa.
   The new initiatives in the war on drugs, Cavazos said, will
include releasing to about 150,000 public and private schools a
model drug use-prevention curriculum covering kindergarten through
grade 12.
   He said the curriculum, titled ``Learning to Live Drug Free,''
is designed to show students how taking drugs harms the user as
well as society.
   Cavazos said more than 600,000 copies of a new handbook for
parents have been distributed. He added that in July a handbook for
college and university officials will be released to provide
strategies for eliminating drug and alcohol abuse on their campuses.

<HEAD>Yogurt Makes USDA Statistics Book for First Time</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yogurt has arrived in the Agriculture
Department's annual book of dairy statistics.
   Last year, according to the new figures, about 912.4 million
pounds of plain and fruit-flavored yogurt were produced. There's no
way to compare that with 1988 because it's the first time the USDA
has published yogurt figures.
   In addition to the regular yogurt, about 66.3 million gallons of
frozen yogurt and 44.2 million gallons of frozen yogurt mix were
produced in 1989.
   By comparison, last year's ice cream production was 831 million
gallons, down 6 percent from 1988. Ice milk, at 377 million
gallons, was up 6 percent, and milk sherbet was unchanged at 52.2
million gallons.
   Dan Buckner of the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service said Wednesday the yogurt figures were requested by the
International Association of Ice Cream Manufacturers.
   The trade group asked that the agency gather and publish figures
only for frozen yogurt, but Buckner it was decided to include
regular yogurt ``so we'd know exactly what we had.''
   Budget crunches in recent years have chewed deeply into some
USDA statistical and economic research programs, and the ice cream
people were prepared to see some of their other items struck from
the list in order to get the yogurt figures.
   However, Buckner said in a telephone interview that it was
possible to squeeze yogurt into the statistical study without
dropping something else.
   But there are some dairy items that one of these days may be
folded into ``other'' categories and not identified separately.
This happens when the number of processing plants and production
decline so much that it would be impossible to protect the
identities of companies.
   For many food manufacturers, including those who turn out dairy
products, exact production figures for various items are considered
trade secrets and are guarded closely.
   One of the candidates for losing its separate statistical
identity is limburger cheese, an aromatic product that tends to
identify itself regardless of manufacturer.
   ``We're going to get a crunch one of these days, and it's going
to be dropped into the `other' (category) because such a small
number of plants make it anymore,'' Buckner said.
   Limburger production in 1989 was shown at 901,000 pounds, down
nearly 8 percent from 1988. Total cheese output rose 1 percent to
5.61 billion pounds, which included 2.67 billion pounds of
American-type cheese.

   Farmer Mac, short for the new Federal
Agricultural Mortgage Corp., has moved a step closer to its debut
in the nation's financial market later this year.
   The new federal agency was created by the Agricultural Credit
Act of 1987 as a secondary market for agricultural real estate
loans.
   Banks and other lenders can convert long-term assets _ in this
case, real estate mortgages _ by selling the loans on the secondary
market. Those who buy the mortgages then package or pool the loans
and sell the mortgage-backed securities to the public.
   The system is designed to improve the cash flow of the original
lenders and make more loan money available.
   Farmer Mac will share the risk of the farm real estate loan
business by guaranteeing returns on the securities.
   Other federal agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. (Freddie Mac), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie
Mae) and Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae)
serve a similar function for their clientele.
   Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. said Tuesday in New York
that it will apply to Farmer Mac to be a certified pooler. As such,
Manufacturers Hanover and the First Boston Corp. will co-manage the
underwritings.
   First Boston was the sole managing underwriter for Farmer Mac's
original stock issue in December 1988. Initial capitalization was
$20 million, provided by the sale of common stock to banks and
other financial institutions.
   The pool assembler is U.S. Agricredit Inc., which has
headquarters in Westminster, Colo., plus offices in Washington,
D.C.; Lincoln, Neb.; and Topeka, Kan.
   Agricredit was established in 1988 and is headed by Frank
Naylor, president and chief executive officer. Naylor is a former
chairman of the Farm Credit Administration and undersecretary of
agriculture during the Reagan administration.

   Sheep do well on a winter pasture of turnips,
says the Agriculture Department.
   Animal nutritionist Steven P. Hart said he has experimented with
sheep grazing on turnip pastures since 1986. The turnips are
``Purpletop,'' a variety familiar to grocery shoppers.
   Hart, who works at the agency's forage and livestock research
laboratory in El Reno, Okla., said the sheep gained well on the
crop.
   ``They'll eat the leaves first, then the top of the turnip,'' he
said Wednesday in a report released here. ``Then they'll actually
eat down into the heart of the turnip, but they don't pull them out
of the ground.''

   ``It stinks,'' Missouri state legislator Jean
Dixon says of the recording industry's voluntary new warning label
for albums containing explicit lyrics.
   ``We all think the label is cute,'' says Daddy O, a member of
Stetsasonic rap music group.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, is hoping that parents whose children bought more than $2
billion worth of records, cassettes and compact discs in 1988 will
agree with Daddy O.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Berman unveiled the industry's
uniform ``parental guidance'' label for recordings that might be
deemed objectionable because of lyrics dealing with sex, violence,
suicide, drug abuse, bigotry or satanic worship.
   The black-and-white logo, which reads ``PARENTAL WARNING _
EXPLICIT LYRICS,'' will appear on the front lower right-hand corner
of new releases reaching retail music stores in July, if the record
companies and performing artists decide they are potentially
offensive.
   Recording manufacturers, distributors and retailers hope the
standardized stickers will halt the drive in a handful of state
legislatures for mandatory warning labels.
   The music industry is backed by the Parents' Music Resource
Center led by Tipper Gore, wife of Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.,
and the National PTA, the consumer advocates who won the industry's
agreement in 1985 to use voluntary warning labels.
   ``We ask state legislators to consider dropping their
legislation in favor of a voluntary system,'' said National PTA
president Ann Lynch.
   ``We clearly have demonstrated that music consumers, especially
parents, want and need label information _ not censorship,'' she
said.
   But Mrs. Dixon, a Republican state representative from
Springfield, Mo., and chief sponsor of a mandatory warning label
bill this year, was unconvinced.
   ``Are they kidding? It stinks. This is a joke,'' she said.
``This plan doesn't even touch most of the music we're talking
about.''
   Berman's trade association represents companies that produce
more than 90 percent of the recordings sold in the United States,
but many of the objectionable records are released by small,
independent companies that don't belong to the recording industry
group.
   Mrs. Dixon also criticized the size, color and content of the
warning labels. Her bill would have required a bright yellow label
that listed specific offensive material, including sex, violence
and substance abuse.
   ``I'm not happy with this, but we'll give it a chance to work,''
she said.
   Berman says all but five of the 21 state legislatures that once
considered mandatory labeling have backed down since the industry
promised in late March to produce a standard, easily recognizable
label.
   He said his association will continue its battle against
mandatory labels in state legislatures in Missouri, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, New York and Louisiana.
   Previously, individual record companies produced their own
diverse warning labels and compliance was erratic. This resulted in
parental complaints and the legislative drives for mandatory labels
on albums with objectionable lyrics, primarily rap and heavy metal
music.
   ``We believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing
voluntary system and better respond to the legitimate concerns of
parents,'' Berman said. ``Now that we have agreed on this new logo,
it will be up to parents to use it as they see fit.''
   Daddy O, the father of five children, applauded the voluntary
labeling system.
   ``We don't think the government should determine what our
children listen to,'' he said. ``We all think the label is cute.''

   Defense and many domestic programs would be
shredded if the $60 billion to $100 billion in automatic spending
cuts that the Bush administration says may soon be necessary
actually take place, analysts say.
   Administration and congressional leaders plan to begin
negotiations next Tuesday aimed at working out a budget deal for
fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   Should they fail, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will
trigger spending slashes that White House budget director Richard
Darman says will be in the $60 billion to $100 billion range from a
spending plan totaling $1.23 trillion.
   ``Neither Congress nor the administration would contemplate cuts
in that realm,'' Robert Reischauer, director of the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office, said Wednesday. ``It's not even in the
realm.''
   Lobbyists agreed.
   Ellen Nissenbaum of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,
which advocates programs for poor people, said a $100 billion cut
would mean that 172,000 pre-school students could lose their spots
in the Head Start program. About 2.3 million poor and elderly
Americans could be dropped by another program that helps them pay
their utility bills, she said.
   ``It would be politically unpalatable across the board,'' she
said.
   Reischauer calculated the effect of a $97 billion cut next year
_ the amount CBO believes may be necessary. He said that would work
out to 24.7 percent cuts in eligible defense spending and 37.2
percent reductions for affected domestic programs.
   Even $60 billion in Gramm-Rudman cuts ``would require reductions
in defense that were nonsensical from a foreign policy perspective,
and would be damaging to domestic programs,'' Reischauer said.
   The overall U.S. economy also would be badly wounded, analysts
said. Cutting federal spending by $100 billion would take that
amount away from corporations, members of the public and other
beneficiaries of government programs.
   As the economy cooled, the government's tax collections would
drop, its payments to the unemployed and the poor would rise and
the deficit would move upward again, Reischauer said.
   ``You would see a slowdown to virtually a stall'' in the
economy, he said.
   Many in Washington believe it will never come down to automatic
cuts of the magnitude Darman is suggesting. They predict that a
budget agreement will be reached by negotiation or the Gramm-Rudman
law will be changed to reduce the amount of savings that are needed.
   If not, however, the Gramm-Rudman cuts would be highly
noticeable to the public.
   ``People who make safety inspections of food and inspections of
the workplace wouldn't show up,'' said Reischauer. ``Thousands of
businesses that sell pencils and paper clips and Stinger missiles
and computers to the government would suddenly find their business
is off dramatically.''
   The Gramm-Rudman cuts would not apply to every program in the
budget.
   In defense, money the government has already committed to
contracts cannot be slashed. Therefore, out of the $290 billion
defense budget, about $190 billion would be subject to the
reductions.
   Nearly three-fourths of domestic programs would also be exempt
from Gramm-Rudman cuts. These includes Social Security payments,
interest on the debt and many federal retirement and veterans'
benefits. Many other programs, including Medicare and guaranteed
student loans, are subject to only limited cuts.
   That means that programs vulnerable to cuts would be hit hard.
   They would include many initiatives in which the government is
building for the future. Education, public housing, science and
highway construction all would be affected.
   ``You'd find entire agencies firing half their staffs,'' said
Stanley Collender, who follows the budget for the accounting firm
Price Waterhouse.

<HEAD>TV Debates May Decide Close Demo Race; Wilson Awaits November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two California Democrats battling for their
party's gubernatorial nomination have been trading the lead almost
as often as pollsters can crank out new numbers.
   The race between former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and
state Attorney General John Van de Kamp may well be decided by two
one-hour debates set for statewide broadcast on Sunday and one week
later.
   With less than one month to go before the state's June 5
primary, the candidates have had few face-to-face encounters and
the campaign largely has been a fund-raising fight and a battle of
television ads.
   ``These campaigns have become a black box,'' said Darry Sragow,
Feinstein's campaign manager. ``On one side you put in dollar
bills, and on the other side you run out video tape.''
   Total spending for the governor's race is expected to reach $18
million to $20 million by November.
   The Democratic contest has been marked by sharp shifts in public
opinion. Feinstein was well ahead of Van de Kamp in early polls,
but the next round of surveys showed her lagging behind by a
seemingly insurmountable double-digit deficit.
   Next, a million-dollar media blitz that extolled Feinstein's
performance as mayor of San Francisco and cast her as a take-charge
executive moved her from 18 percentage points behind Van de Kamp to
19 ahead in six weeks.
   That heavy lead soon evaporated, fueled by Van de Kamp ads
attacking Feinstein's mayoral record. But a Los Angeles Times poll
released in early May had her bouncing back with a 13-point lead,
37 percent to 24 percent over Van de Kamp. The undecided vote was
even higher, at 38 percent.
   On the Republican side, low-key, low-profile Pete Wilson has no
major opposition and is steadily raising money for the November
general election.
   When Feinstein was trailing in the polls, Wilson went out of his
way to bolster her candidacy in hopes of eroding Van de Kamp's
support. But as Feinstein's campaign gained momentum, Wilson
largely abandoned that tactic.
   Feinstein has crisscrossed the state in recent months, hoping to
overcome her earlier lack of personal contact with Democrats
outside her San Francisco home base. Her unabashed support for the
death penalty and her vocal anti-drug stand have won backing from
moderate and conservative Democrats.
   Van de Kamp, however, received the official endorsement of the
state Democratic Party and has the support of other grassroots
Democratic groups and organized labor.
   Van de Kamp has built his campaign on ethics, the environment
and crime, pushing ballot initiatives on each subject in hopes they
will generate popular support for his candidacy.
   Feinstein is the first woman to make a serious bid for the
California governorship. But it is Van de Kamp, who describes
himself as ``the best feminist in this race,'' who has received the
most backing from women's rights activists.
   A $1.3 million infusion into Feinstein's campaign from her
wealthy husband, real estate magnate Richard Blum, has kept her
drive alive and financed her television campaign.
   Van de Kamp, with perhaps double Feinstein's money, has received
help from Democratic stars including San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos,
Feinstein's bitterly critical successor.
   Wilson is likely to raise the most money before November,
probably $10 million or more, with substantial help from
out-of-state sources. President Bush has headlined two Wilson
fund-raisers and reportedly plans to attend at least two more.
   Republicans consider a Wilson victory pivotal to protecting GOP
interests in next year's reapportionment battle. The redrawing of
political boundaries and the shifts in population are expected to
boost California's congressional delegation by as many as seven
members.

   Mickey Rourke has joined his girlfriend,
Carre Otis, his co-star in the steamy ``Wild Orchid,'' in suing the
film's producers for releasing nude pictures to Playboy.
   The photos depict the couple's torrid sex scene.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges the producers did not get
Rourke's approval before releasing the photos ``for use in tawdry
sex pictorials for financial gain and in order to obtain publicity
for the film.''
   The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said the photos
have hurt Rourke's reputation in the industry.
   Nude photos taken during filming of ``Wild Orchid'' appear in
the June issue of Playboy and the April edition of the German
magazine Kino.
   The lawsuit names Kruger-Brent Group Inc., Brazil Star Films,
Vision P.D.G. and Vision International.
   Vision International chairman Mark Damon was unavailable for
comment, his secretary said.
   Miss Otis filed a similar lawsuit last week.

   Film director David Lynch has a hit with the
TV series ``Twin Peaks,'' but he's no fan of the small screen.
   ``I hate the quality of video. I hate the small screen, I hate
the lousy sound and I wish it were different,'' Lynch said in this
week's Entertainment Weekly magazine.
   Lynch, director of ``Blue Velvet,'' likens seeing his movies on
video to looking at a bad reproduction of a painting. ``People say,
`I saw your film. I saw it on video.' But the truth is, they didn't
see the film,'' he said.
   As the public gravitates more and more toward videocassettes for
movie viewing, directors are also losing control over how their
movies are watched, he said. Viewers fast-forward, pause and rewind
during viewing.
   ``It's a joke,'' said Lynch.

   The Bush administration is expected to name
career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to
Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
   The administration had planned to send another career diplomat,
Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after
concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight
because she has been a target of conservatives.
   The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua
quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that
U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost
11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
   Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving
Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation
after long years of warfare.
   The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July
1988. At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were
interfering in the country's internal affairs.
   The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight
Nicaraguan envoys in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos
Tunnermann.
   Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru,
Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on
Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
   He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called
back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a
senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua
but said he was not interested.
   He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally
by President Bush. When Bush telephoned him earlier this week,
Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
   In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top
Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a
diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President
Reagan.
   The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of
his conservative allies would not assure the administration that
they would not delay Wells' nomination.
   When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late
1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11
months. They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to
the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist
government.

   A U.S. airline pilot, a British tycoon and a
Soviet cosmonaut hope to be the first adventurers to circle the
globe non-stop in a balloon.
   ``Only three years ago, such a trip as this would have been
considered unthinkable,'' co-captain Richard Branson of the United
Kingdom said Wednesday at a news conference announcing the attempt.
   In the past, the Soviet Union refused to allow a balloon into
its airspace, said project leader and captain Larry Newman of
Scottsdale, Ariz. But the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos last year
agreed to permit the expedition and even offered cosmonaut Vladimir
Dzhanibekov as a partner, Newman said.
   Newman, an America West pilot, made the first successful
trans-Atlantic balloon flight in 1978 and holds the world distance
record for a balloon, 5,209 miles across the Pacific in 1981.
   Branson crossed the Atlantic in a hot-air balloon in 1987.
Dzhanibekov, a pilot, is chief of Glavkosmos' cosmonaut training
department and has been in space five times.
   The helium balloon will take off from Loral Airdock in Akron,
Ohio, sometime between November and February, whenever weather
conditions are best.
   Newman called the balloon, essentially a giant plastic bag whose
design has not been unveiled, ``our secret weapon.'' It was
conceived by Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites Inc., who also
designed the Voyager aircraft that made the first non-stop flight
around the world without refueling.
   Newman, Branson and Dzhanibekov will spend 14 to 25 days at an
altitude of at least 35,000 feet in the balloon's 24-by-10-foot
pressurized capsule.
   The 1,200-pound fiberglass craft, insulated with styrofoam to
protect the crew from temperatures that can reach 60 below zero,
will have no steering capability, leaving the crew at the mercy of
the winds.
   ``The vagaries of the wind are essentially our engineer,''
Newman said.
   The three expect to be carried at 75 mph to 200 mph across the
Atlantic, central Europe, the Soviet Union, north of the Himalayas,
across the Pacific and back to the United States. They hope to land
``anywhere east of the longitudinal line of Akron,'' Newman said.
   Branson estimated the endeavor would cost ``in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars,'' primarily financed by his Virgin Atlantic
Airways.
   NASA will supply navigational and communications equipment, and
the crew will conduct experiments for the agency to measure wind
shears and examine the stratospheric ozone.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide
advisories on weather conditions, maps and graphs and a
search-and-rescue beacon, said NOAA official Gary Castle.
   In the early 1980s, Maxie Anderson of Albuquerque, N.M., and Don
Ida of Boulder, Colo., made three unsuccessful attempts to circle
the world in a helium balloon, taking a route south of the U.S.S.R.
   Newman, however, considers his own effort the first
``practical'' attempt.
   ``In my mind, this flight couldn't have been made with any other
balloon that you've ever seen before,'' he said.

   President Bush says being poor is no excuse
for being out of shape.
   ``Even someone who is not having it so good can stay physically
fit,'' Bush said in a session with health and fitness writers at
the White House.
   ``I think that anybody can participate in certain kinds of
fitness,'' said Bush, who gave the interview on Tuesday as part of
his efforts to promote National Fitness Month.
   ``Yes, there's differences,'' he acknowledged. ``Some can afford
snappy LifeCycles or Stairmasters and afford to go to health clubs,
and plenty of people can't.
   ``But the concept of an individual doing some kind of athletics
or some kind of calisthenics to stay fit transcends economic lines,
it seems to me,'' Bush told reporters from the Detroit Free Press
and other newspapers and magazines.
   Bush said he and his fitness czar, actor-bodybuilder Arnold
Schwarzenegger, want to debunk the notion that only the fiscally
fit have the time or means to worry about exercise.
   The president, who turns 66 next month, has an array of
expensive exercise equipment for his personal use a few steps from
the Oval Office, not to mention a horseshoe pit, heated pool and
tennis court nearby.
   Bush captained the baseball team at Yale and has played tennis
and golf all his life. He still jogs three times a week for two
miles at a ``slowpoke'' 9{-minute pace. The 6-foot-2 president said
he is about five pounds overweight.
   Bush credits all this exercise with helping him keep up a daily
7 a.m.-to-6 p.m. schedule in the Oval Office, plus ``two or three
other events'' at home in the evenings.
   ``I don't believe I could do that if I weren't physically fit,''
he told interviewers.
   ``People think, `What's this Ivy League elitist doing playing
horseshoes? This is some put-on deal,''' said Bush. ``But now they
know I like it and, as Arnold can attest, I'm reasonably good.''
   Bush acknowledged he came from a privileged background where
competitive sports were part of growing up.
   ``I'm not suggesting that everybody's had it so good,'' he said.
``But I am suggesting that an example of an athletic presidency can
set a tone for this concept of fitness that Arnold and I are
working together on.''
   The writers pressed the president on what he planned to do for
Americans who cannot afford to see a doctor. An estimated 30
million Americans, most in working poor families, have no health
insurance.
   Bush said Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is
searching for ways ``to get control of costs. And if we can do
that, I think that will expand services.''
   Asked if health care should be a basic right for all citizens,
he said: ``I would think so, yes. But that doesn't mean that I
think the federal government is the only way to do it.''
   ``All levels of government'' must be involved, plus charitable
care and ``neighbor helping neighbor,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>EPA Studies Tobacco As Indoor Pollutant</HEAD>

   The federal government is looking at tobacco
smoke as an indoor pollutant in a draft assessment that is becoming
the focus of a debate over whether ``passive smoking'' is harmful
to your health.
   Anti-smoking activists say the Environmental Protection Agency's
work could encourage tighter restrictions on smoking, while tobacco
industry spokesmen said a scientific review would show there is no
evidence that non-smokers are being hurt.
   The EPA said Wednesday it is drawing up a policy guide to
workplace smoking restrictions and an assessment of the cancer risk
to non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke.
   Agency spokesman Dave Ryan said he could not discuss the content
of the draft until it is submitted to an independent science
advisory board, probably later this month.
   But EPA sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
draft assessment includes a statement that ``passive smoking'' is a
known carcinogen, responsible for more than 3,000 cases of lung
cancer among non-smokers each year.
   The draft conclusions were reported first in Wednesday's Los
Angeles Times.
   In a statement, the EPA said its risk assessment will classify
ETS _ the smoke to which non-smokers are exposed at work and
elsewhere _ ``according to the agency's carcinogen assessment
guidelines.''
   It said the risk assessment was based on 24 studies of the
association between passive smoking and lung cancer.
   The separate policy guide ``will describe the technical basis
for smoking restrictions as well as the technical and policy
options for mitigating exposures'' to tobacco smoke, the agency
said.
   The EPA's work usually involves regulating pollutants discharged
outdoors by smokestacks or effluent pipes. The agency said the
assessment of passive smoking's dangers is being carried out under
the authority of the Radon Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act
of 1986.
   John Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking OR Health,
an anti-smoking group, said the report could encourage the idea
that the EPA should be more involved in controlling indoor
pollutants.
   His group is suing another arm of the federal government, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, to force it to ban
smoking in workplaces nationwide or restrict it to separately
ventilated areas.
   ``I think there's going to be a tremendous breakthrough when the
average person realizes that tobacco smoke can kill him or his
loved one,'' Banzhaf said.
   ``What they will report is that tobacco smoke is more dangerous
than all of the other pollutants we regulate put together,'' he
said. ``Tobacco smoke is far more dangerous than radon, it is far
more dangerous than lead in gasoline, it is far more dangerous than
asbestos.''
   John R. Nelson, vice president of corporate affairs for Philip
Morris U.S.A., said most of the studies the EPA is relying on
examined very small groups of people, usually in the home rather
than the workplace. He said they have found no evidence that
tobacco smoke is causing lung cancer among American non-smokers.
   ``Our interest in this process is that the EPA consider all the
scientific information out there,'' Nelson said. ``If they do that,
they'll be compelled to conclude the evidence is not there to
conclude that environmental tobacco smoke is a scientifically
significant risk to nonsmokers.''
   He said the largest study, for a Ph.D. dissertation at Yale
University by Dr. Luis Varela, found that non-smokers exposed to
tobacco smoke in the workplace or from their spouses at home had no
statistically significant risk of lung cancer.
   The Varela study also found that the more smokers were exposed
to smoke in social situations, the lower their risk of developing
lung cancer, Nelson said.
   The EPA said in its statement that it was aware of the Varela
study and was seeking more information about it.

   The country's second-largest political
party has asked Parliament to declare its intention to leave the
Warsaw Pact and become a neutral nation.
   The proposal made Wednesday by the League of Free Democrats
advocates making it clear that Hungary does not wish to belong to
either the Warsaw Pact or NATO.
   It is similar to a 1956 government statement that annulled
Hungary's membership in the Soviet-led military alliance and
prompted the Soviet invasion that crushed a nationalist uprising.
   Deputy Parliament Speaker Matyas Szueroes said the proposal
would be discussed during the next session of the new Parliament,
which was chosen in March and April in the country's first free
elections in four decades.
   The liberal Free Democrats, led by former dissidents, won 94 of
Parliament's 394 seats in the balloting. The largest party, the
center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum, won 165 seats and is
trying to form a coalition government with smaller, traditional
parties.
   The Socialist Party, which is dominated by former members of the
long-ruling Communist Party, won 33 seats.
   The Free Democrats have not been approached as coalition
partners and it is unclear if a new government would adopt their
proposal.
   The party campaigned on a platform of swift transfer to a free
market economy, while the Democratic Forum emphasized the need to
avoid social disruption and generally emphasizes conservative,
traditional values.
   Hungary's leadership has until now pledged to remain in the
Soviet-led alliance, although individual leaders have repeatedly
suggested the country could one day become neutral.
   The Free Democrats proposed the new move on the basis of the
1956 statement.
   The proposal was presented by Miklos Vasarhelyi, an associate of
Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956 uprising. Vasarhelyi was
imprisoned following the uprising. Nagy was executed after a show
trial.
   Three days after Hungary declared its withdrawal from the Warsaw
Pact, Soviet troops and tanks rolled into Budapest. They have since
remained, though Hungary has negotiated the complete withdrawal of
Soviet troops from its territory by the middle of next year.
   The new Parliament has asked to re-negotiate the accord to
provide for a quicker withdrawal.
   A special subcommittee of the foreign relations committee in
Parliament is examining the issue.
   Vasarhelyi said the proposal does not call for Hungary's
immediate withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact but opens negotiations on
the topic with Moscow.
   But he said that if the proposal is adopted, Hungary should
suspend all activity in the East bloc alliance and forbid Warsaw
Pact exercises on its soil.
   The Warsaw Pact was established in 1955 and includes the Soviet
Union, East Germany, Poland, Czechslovakia, Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria. The alliance's future is uncertain now that most of its
members have virtually broken free of Soviet domination.

<HEAD>Minnesota Senator Faces New Ethics Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger faces new ethics charges
that he abused his office and misused Senate money in a ``pattern
of improper conduct'' involving his Minneapolis condominium.
   The Senate Ethics Committee on Wednesday widened its case
against the Minnesota Republican by finding ``substantial credible
evidence'' of financial wrongdoing, misrepresentations to the
Senate and improper administration of his blind trust.
   The latest allegations stem from Senate expense payments that
Durenberger claimed for renting the residence that he partly owned
for several years. Durenberger may have violated federal law as
well as Senate rules, the committee said.
   The latest charges were added to an earlier list of allegations
that will be the subject of trial-like committee hearings scheduled
to begin June 12.
   The committee last February charged Durenberger with six
possible rules violations stemming from a $100,000 book promotion
deal and acceptance of free limousine service for personal travel.
   The new allegations are the first mention in the case of
Durenberger's blind trust, which had been approved by the Ethics
Committee in February 1986.
   Durenberger's chief of staff, Bert McKasy, said the trust held
the senator's interest in the condominium partnership.
   ``The question, as we understand it, is whether the trustee of a
trust, who is also the senator's attorney, and the senator, should
have discussed the sale of the condominium and related matters,''
McKasy said.
   The committee listed three other possible violations:
   _Submitting misleading travel reimbursement vouchers to the
Senate.
   _Misrepresenting the ownership of the condominium.
   _Backdating real estate transactions and other documents through
which Durenberger transferred the property to a partnership in 1984.
   The panel found ``substantial cause'' to conclude that
Durenberger ``may have abused his United States Senate Office and
misused United States Senate funds through a pattern of improper
conduct which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate.''
   ``This is the logical next step in the inquiry,'' said
Durenberger's press secretary, Lois West. ``It's what we expected
would happen.''
   Durenberger has denied any wrongdoing in the condominium deal,
although he admitted he was trying to cut the expense of
maintaining homes in both the Washington area and Minnesota.
   Durenberger transferred the condominium to a partnership in
which he was a partner in 1984 and backdated papers to obtain
reimbursement for staying there in 1983, according to documents he
provided the Senate Rules Committee.
   He sold the property to a company owned by his former campaign
manager in 1987 but continued to get reimbursed for staying there
until late last year.
   Durenberger repaid the Senate $11,005 last January after the
rules committee decided he was not entitled to expenses incurred
when he stayed at the condominium during official congressional
recesses.
   He also used the condominium when he returned to Minnesota on
weekends and at other times when the Senate was in session.
   Durenberger's aides claim the backdating was proper since the
senator had made the agreement for the partnership at that time.
   Durenberger said last week that he had been negotiating
informally with the ethics committee and that the hearing date
served as a deadline for reaching a settlement. If he negotiated a
plea agreement by then, the hearings would be unnecessary.
   McKasy said ``the committee's statement makes clear that all
matters will be resolved together in the near future.''
   Durenberger does not face re-election until 1994, but polls
indicate he has lost significant support in Minnesota because of
the year-old ethics investigation.
   Four of the six counts approved against Durenberger on Feb. 22
result from an arrangement he had with a publisher to promote two
books he had written. A fifth count charged Durenberger with
accepting gifts of limousine service for personal trips in the
Boston area.
   The sixth count alleged that Durenberger's actions reflected
poorly on the Senate.

   The Senate is moving toward passing a bill to
loosen a ban on political campaigning by federal employees, as
Republican opponents bowed to repeated defeats on amendments and
agreed to allow a final vote.
   Under an agreement reached late Wednesday between the two
parties' leaders _ Democrat George Mitchell of Maine and Republican
Bob Dole of Kansas _ the Senate would vote on a wholesale revision
of the 1939 Hatch Act before recessing tonight.
   Before the final vote, minority Republicans will have the
opportunity to offer nine more amendments, including a measure by
Dole to continue the current restrictions on employees in
intelligence agencies, the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue
Service and the Federal Election Commission.
   A similar amendment by Dole was defeated on a 51-46 vote Tuesday.
   Despite a veto threat by President Bush, the bill was
overwhelmingly approved by the House a year ago. And in several
test votes this week and last, several Republican senators joined
Democrats in defeating amendments by Dole and other GOP leaders
aimed at retaining most of the current restrictions.
   Some 2.9 million federal civil service and postal workers are
now prohibited entirely from working in campaigns, soliciting
contributions and holding office in the political parties or
attending their state and national conventions as delegates.
   Even holding a campaign placard at a rally or voting in local
caucuses on party nominations is a Hatch Act violation, for which a
federal employee can be suspended from his or her job.
   The union-endorsed bill would still prohibit federal workers
from engaging in any political activities while on the job and
continue to bar them from running for public office or soliciting
campaign contributions from the public.
   But they could start holding office in local, state and national
political organizations and for the first time solicit campaign
funds from the co-workers on behalf of candidates or federal
employee union political action committees.
   Dole called the bill a ``pot of gold'' for the Democrats because
they receive, on average, about 90 percent of the millions of
dollars in PAC contributions already raised by postal and federal
employee unions.
   Democrats have repeatedly denied an ulterior motive, saying they
only want to give federal workers ``the same political rights that
people in Eastern Europe are beginning to exert.''
   Bush's senior advisers have said they would urge him to veto any
change in the law as ``undermining the integrity and independence
of the traditionally non-partisan civil service.''
   The Senate has spent more than a week on the legislation, with
Democrats mustering between a dozen and 17 Republican votes on each
of the challenging amendments by GOP leaders.
   George Gould, a lobbyist for the National Association of Letter
Carriers, called the stream of amendments an attempt by GOP leaders
to ``slow the process to give the White House time to try to peel
away votes.''
   Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming admitted his party
lacked the 40 votes needed to maintain a filibuster against the
bill in the 100-member Senate. He said the real test will come
later when the White House asks Republican leaders to scrape
together the 34 votes needed to sustain a veto by Bush.
   In Bush's first 16 months in office, congressional Democrats
have been unable in 10 attempts to override any of his vetoes.

<TEXT>
   An ex-convict was convicted of poisoning
the historic Treaty Oak with a powerful herbicide in an alleged
occult ritual at the centuries-old tree and could get up to life in
prison.
   Paul Stedman Cullen Jr., 46, faces five to 99 years in prison
following his conviction by a jury Wednesday of criminal mischief.
His sentencing hearing was to begin today.
   Cullen, jailed since his arrest last June, could receive a harsh
sentence because of a previous burglary conviction and problems
while on probation.
   Cullen refused to comment as he was led from court, but his
father insisted his son had done no harm to the 60-foot oak
discovered poisoned a year ago.
   ``They convicted an innocent man,'' said the elder Cullen.
   Legend has it that Texas patriarch Stephen F. Austin and Indians
signed a treaty in the 1820s under the giant oak estimated to be at
least 500 years old. The tree is a city landmark, and people have
gotten married under its boughs.
   The tree shed six sets of leaves in as many months after it was
poisoned with Velpar, and half the tree's crown is bare. Residents
put get-well cards under the tree and lit candles for its recovery.
   Prosecutors said Cullen poisoned the tree in a ritual to either
end his affection for his drug counselor or to protect her from
harm.
   Defense lawyers Terry Kirk described the ex-convict as a
``loser'' with little self-esteem who boasted falsely about
poisoning the tree to impress an acquaintance, Cindy Blaco.
   Kirk said Ms. Blaco became the prosecution's key witness to
claim some $11,000 in rewards.
   Ms. Blaco testified that during February 1989 _ when experts
believe the tree was poisoned _ Cullen had several books on
witchcraft and the occult. She said she saw two containers of
Velpar in the back of Cullen's truck. Traces of the herbicide also
were found in the truck by police after Cullen's arrest.
   More than $100,000 has been donated to save the tree.
Velpar-contaminated dirt has been removed from around its roots,
the tree has been doused with spring water and elaborate screens
were built to shade it.

   Shipping companies scrambled to get
barges off the Missouri River after a federal judge, acting to
protect fishermen, reduced the amount of water that may be released
from a reservoir upstream.
   ``We're going to lose a lot of money _ several hundred thousand
dollars,'' said Roger Blaske, co-owner of Blaske Marine Inc. in
Alton, Ill.
   His company was trying to get barges moved downstream from the
Omaha, Neb., area Wednesday for fear they will be marooned by
falling water. He said his company would try to get business on
other rivers, including the Mississippi.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy's ruling, issued Wednesday in
Bismarck, N.D., will keep the depth of South Dakota's Lake Oahe
steady until June 1, when the reservoir's walleye hatch will have
ended.
   South Dakota officials contended the hatch would have been
destroyed if the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had gone ahead with
plans to lower the reservoir 3 feet this month, and the judge
agreed there would be irreparable harm.
   Officials in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana praised the
ruling, saying it would save a vital fishing industry.
   But the downstream states of Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri said
drinking water, wildlife and power plants would suffer, in addition
to shipping companies.
   A spokesman for Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr called the decision ``very
disturbing news,'' and the Army Corps of Engineers will appeal the
ruling.
   But South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson said the three states,
including his, already have won. Even an expedited appeal is likely
to take a few weeks, Mickelson said. By then, ``we will have
accomplished most of what we set out to do,'' he said.
   The river's main shipping channel runs 730 miles from Sioux
City, Iowa, to St. Louis.
   Because of the ruling, the river was expected to begin dropping
at Sioux City by midday today, at Omaha by May 11 and at Kansas
City by May 14, said corps spokesman John Ferrell.
   Chet Worm, chief of the corps' reservoir regulation section,
said the reduction would probably drop the river level by about 3{
feet at Sioux City and by about 3 feet at Omaha. Kansas City likely
would see a drop of 2 feet.
   ``It couldn't come at a worse time,'' said Marion Conover,
fisheries management supervisor for the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources. He said most of the fish that build nests to lay their
eggs spawn in May and early June.
   Don Cummings, wildlife management supervisor for the same
agency, said the lower water would hurt waterfowl, too. ``We did
see some little ducklings and geese along the river,'' he said.
``The lower water is going to leave them high and dry.''
   Once the river is lowered, the corps may not be able to raise it
again because the water could flood the nests of protected birds,
Worm said.
   In Sioux City, water systems supervisor Rick Mach said the lower
water would affect the alluvial wells where the city gets its
water. The city has had to ration water the last two summers
because of drought.
   ``If we are going to have a low Missouri River, we will have to
consider water rationing at a sooner time,'' Mach said.
   Utility officials in Nebraska and Iowa said the lower water
could cause problems for power plants, if they extend beyond June
1. Many plants draw in river water for cooling.
   ``It's entirely possible there would be some forced outages,''
said Omaha Public Power District spokesman Mark Gautier.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes International CFC Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is opposing a special
$100 million international fund to help poor nations curb their use
of ozone-depleting chemicals, saying such assistance should be made
through existing channels.
   ``The United States agrees that financial assistance should be
made available to help developing countries phase out production of
CFCs (chloroflurocarbons),'' White House deputy press secretary
Roman Popadiuk said Wednesday in a prepared statement.
   ``However, we believe it is more sensible to use existing
institutions and existing financial mechanisms already established
by the World Bank,'' Popadiuk said.
   A World Bank spokesman said Wednesday that the institution has
insufficient resources to handle the millions of dollars needed for
such a project.
   ``The spirit of (former Interior Secretary) James Watt has been
reincarnated in the bodies of (White House chief of staff) John
Sununu and (budget director) Richard Darman, the Tweedledum and
Tweedledee of environmentalism in the 1990s,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said, ``It is incredible to me that
the Bush administration would be unwilling to come up with the very
modest sums involved in the transition fund.''
   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., began circulating a letter to the
president among colleagues asking for a meeting with the
administration on the decision.
   The establishment of such a fund was to be proposed at an
ongoing CFC conference in Geneva, which U.S. representatives are
attending, The Washington Post reported. The European-initiated
proposal wants money to help Third World countries convert to
alternative chemicals and identify ways to replace CFCs, the Post
said.
   Such a fund would be administered by an international lending
authority, such as the World Bank, according to the newspaper.
   CFCs are used widely for refrigeration and aerosol products, as
well as some production. Scientists say CFC emissions ares
depleting the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful
ultraviolet rays.
   The United States has signed a treaty calling for cutting CFCs
in half by the end of the century.

   The American public is more interested in the
release of U.S. hostages held in the Middle East than any other
news story so far this year, according to a new survey.
   Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they paid close
attention to the April release of Robert Polhill and Frank Reed,
according to the Times Mirror News Interest Index issued today.
   The index periodically measures public interest and awareness of
the news.
   The response marked the first time in 1990 that more than
one-third of the public had focused intense interest on an
individual news event, the survey said.
   Political change in Eastern and Central Europe earlier had been
the most consistently watched story, generating interest among
about 30 percent of respondents since September, the survey found.
   The second most popular story in April was the celebration of
Earth Day, which 31 percent of respondents said they watched
closely.
   Stories about the Lithuanian independence movement interested 27
percent of those surveyed, slightly less than 29 percent the
previous month
   Twenty-four percent of respondents said they closely followed
news of the Hubble Space Telescope and of difficulties in taking
the 1990 census, and 18 percent were interested in stories about
renewed inflation and rising interest rates.
   The civil war in Cambodia drew the least attention among
readers, generating interest from 4 percent of respondents. May Day
protests in Moscow interested just 9 percent, the survey said.
   The Times Mirror News Interest Index is based on a telephone
survey of 1,218 adults 18 or older, conducted May 3-7 under the
direction of the Princeton Survey Research Associates. The margin
of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Asks Stiffer Penalties for Cross Burnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says he has
asked Congress to stiffen criminal penalties for cross burnings and
other forms of racial harassment that do not result in personal
injuries.
   The proposed amendments to the 1968 Civil Rights Act would make
cross burnings a felony under federal law punishable by a five-year
prison sentence and a fine up to $250,000.
   The offense is now a misdemeanor that carries a maximum one-year
sentence and a $100,000 fine.
   Misdemeanor penalties would be retained to allow prosecutors to
bring lesser charges in appropriate cases, the department said in a
letter to Congress.
   The harsher penalties are proposed for what Thornburgh called
``particularly egregious cases _ those where firearms are used or
fire or threats of fire, including cross burnings, are employed.''
   Thornburgh's statement Wednesday cited a case in which people
who burned down a home rented by a black family were prosecuted for
a misdemeanor because there were no injuries.

<HEAD>FDA Putting Stronger Warnings On Growth Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it will
strengthen warnings about a possible risk of leukemia for children
taking a growth-stimulating drug.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends,
asked the FDA in February to ban the sale of human growth hormone,
or HGH, pending further study to determine whether it increases the
risk of leukemia.
   Studies in Japan, Europe and the United States suggest that the
risk of getting leukemia within four years after completing HGH
treatment is two to three times greater than for children who have
not received HGH, he said.
   FDA spokeswoman Faye Peterson said Wednesday the agency is aware
of the studies.
   She said the agency has not yet responded to Rifkin's petition
but added that FDA officials ``are going to adjust the labeling to
make the wording stronger (on a possible leukemia risk).
   ``But we're not going to take any action on the drug,'' she
said. ``There's not enough evidence to do anything that will
disturb its use.''
   The wording of the warning has not been worked out, she added.
   The genetically-engineered HGH is sold by Genentech Inc. under
the trade name Protropin and Eli Lilly under the trade name
Humatrope.

<HEAD>More Americans Eligible to Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Americans old enough to vote
this fall is up more than 3.6 million from two years ago, but the
odds are fewer will actually turn out.
   The nation's voting-age population will climb to 186,382,000 by
November's election, the Census Bureau projected on Wednesday.
   That's up from about 182.7 million two years ago, the bureau
said.
   But the absence of a presidential contest this year means there
will probably be less public interest and so a lower turnout.
   An estimated 50.1 percent of voting-age Americans voted for
president in the 1988 general election. In 1986, the last
congressional election year without a presidential vote, only 33.4
percent voted.
   The new Census report shows that voters in the 25-to-44 age
group will make up 43.9 percent of eligible voters, up from 43.5
percent two years ago and 38.5 percent in 1980.
   Voters aged 18-to-24 will be only 13.8 percent of those eligible
this fall, down from 14.5 percent in 1988 and 18.4 percent in 1980.
   Those aged 45 to 64, will be 25.2 percent of voters, down from
25.3 percent in 1988 and 27.3 percent in 1980.
   But voters aged 65 and over will be 17 percent, an increase from
16.7 percent two years ago and 15.7 percent in 1980.
   Women will outnumber men in the voting age population by 97.1
million to 89.2 million, the report shows.
   The voting-age population will include 21.1 million blacks and
6.1 million persons of other races, such as Asians, Pacific
islanders and American Indians.

<HEAD>British Spy Told Stalin of Nazi Attempt to Make Peace with Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kim Philby, the famed Soviet mole in British
intelligence, told Soviet authorities about Rudolf Hess's secret
mission to Britain to arrange a separate peace three days after it
happened, Tass reported.
   The May 1941 mission came a month before Nazi Germany attacked
the Soviet Union, and prosecutors at the Nuremberg war crimes trial
said the Germans, through Hess, were seeking peace with Britain so
they could concentrate their efforts against the Soviets.
   ``It would have been possible to save hundreds of thousands, or
even millions, of human lives, if Stalin had trusted Soviet
intelligence officers' reports about Nazi Germany's preparations
for an attack on the Soviet Union,'' Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, said Wednesday.
   Tass counted Philby among the Soviet agents. The British
intelligence officer spied for the Soviets for 30 years.
   Soviet secret archives on the flight of Hess, Adolf Hitler's
deputy, will be declassified in the next few days, the news agency
said. It will include materials sent by Philby, Tass said.
   Hess flew to England in a Messerschmitt fighter plane on May 10,
1941 to try to arrange a peace treaty. He said he did so without
Adolf Hitler's knowledge, but that was never proved.
   Hess was jailed after his flight. After the war, he was
convicted of war crimes and imprisoned until his death in 1987 in
Berlin.
   Tass claimed Philby helped thwart Nazi attempts to conclude a
separate peace with the Western allies.
   Philby also gave Stalin the allies' strategy going into the
Potsdam conference in July 1945, where the victors worked out
details of the post-war arrangements for Europe, Tass said.
   It said Philby's reports were responsible for Stalin's cunning
smile at the conference, which was noted by a number of journalists
who covered it.
   Tass said British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote in his
memoirs that he was shaken by the depth of Stalin's perception into
British policy in North Africa during the war.
   ``However, this `perception' was based on precise information
received from (British intelligence), where Philby was making a
sky-rocketing career,'' Tass said.
   Philby also used his position in British intelligence to warn
Stalin of Nazi plans for an offensive near Kursk in the summer of
1943, Tass said. The warning allowed the Soviets to build up troops
in the area before the great battle.
   Philby had access to intercepted German radio messages and
passed them on to the Soviets, allowing Soviet authorities to catch
German intelligence agents smuggled into the Soviet Union, Tass
said.
   A film about Philby, one of several Cambridge University
graduates who became Soviet spies in the 1930s, is scheduled to be
shown on Soviet television Friday. Tass promised it will contain
``many historical sensations'' on the spy, who fled to Moscow in
1963 ahead of British investigators. He died there in 1988.
   The television film, ``Cambridge Graduate,'' also will show
Philby's liaison officer, a Moscow woman named Zoya Voskresenskaya,
Tass said.

   Pop singer Sinead O'Connor became the second
entertainer to boycott this weekend's ``Saturday Night Live''
because of guest host Andrew Dice Clay's foul-mouth brand of humor.
   ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member Nora Dunn announced Monday
that she will not go on the air because of the comedian's
expletive-laden routines _ which refer to women as ``bitches'' and
``pigs,'' seldom outside of a sexual context.
   On Wednesday, O'Connor joined the anti-Clay chorus.
   ``It would be nonsensical of `Saturday Night Live' to expect a
woman to perform songs about a woman's experiences after a
monologue by Andrew Dice Clay,'' her spokeswoman, Elaine Schock,
said in a phone interview from Pelham, N.Y.
   ``Saturday Night Live'' producer Lorne Michaels said the NBC
program will find a new musical guest and the show will go on. And
Clay ``has given me his word'' that he will not violate programming
standards, Michaels said.
   MTV banned Clay from its cable network last year after he
delivered a monologue laced with lewd poetry and references to fat
women and sex. Clay had assured MTV ``repeatedly, that his material
would be in line with our programming standards,'' a network
official at the time.
   Dunn, a five-year cast member, applauded O'Connor's boycott as a
``very classy thing to do.''
   ``This is not about dirty words. This is about the language of
rape. If you took the word `woman' in his routine and replaced it
with `Jew,' I guarantee you that person would not be on Saturday
Night Live,'' Dunn said.
   O'Connor's album ``I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got'' is No. 1
on the Billboard pop chart. Her single ``Nothing Compares 2 U,''
written by rock star Prince, also is the No. 1 pop song on
Billboard's charts.
   Schock said the Irish singer watched videos of Dice's routine
Wednesday and decided to back out of the show.
   ``I feel it shows disrespect of women that `Saturday Night Live'
expected me to perform on the same show as Andrew Dice Clay,''
O'Connor said through her spokeswoman.
   Clay, whose act has been called racist and homophobic as well as
sexist, called Dunn ``Nora Dunce'' in an interview taped for
Wednesday evening on ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   ``I think Nora Dunce is a very silly girl,'' he said, ``because
I've watched `Saturday Night Live' many times and I've seen her
play from hookers to just, like, street tramps and I wouldn't look
at that and go, `If that's really her, I wouldn't do the show.'
   ``I think she's just doing this because I am the hottest comic
in the world today. I didn't invent dirty words, I just know how to
make 'em rhyme.''
   In his act, Clay recites lewd parodies of nursery rhymes.
   Dunn, reached at her New York home Wednesday, responded, ``He's
not too bright, is he? I've never played hookers or streetwalkers.''
   Michaels said the defections took him by surprise.
   ``Suddenly we were getting phone calls and it sort of blindsided
us,'' he said in a telephone interview from New York, where
rehearsals were under way for Saturday's show.
   He said Dunn did not talk to him about boycotting the show, but
``if it is about conscience and principles, I have to applaud her
for that.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The highly organized radical students
who have battled police by the tens of thousands this week are
among the elite of South Korea's young, a pampered
anti-establishment cadre.
   As university students, they are the pride and joy of a nation
that equates education with success and prosperity. As
international symbols of militance, they are a deep embarrassment
in a society that values harmony.
   In Korea's strict authoritarian society, it seems paradoxical
that senior government officials often urge students to avoid
protest and then treat student protesters with leniency.
   Perhaps that is because Koreans generally sympathize with
student protesters, though without necessarily agreeing with their
opinions or tactics.
   On Wednesday, tens of thousands of students battled riot police
in Seoul and 16 other cities to demand the ouster of President Roh
Tae-woo.
   The violence coincided with the inaugural convention of the
newly created Democratic Liberal Party. Opponents contend the
gigantic new governing party, a merger of three political groups,
will lead to dictatorship.
   The rioting was the most violent in the capital since 1987.
Police said they arrested 1,864 people nationwide but released most
with warnings. About 150 people, including some 100 police, were
injured, they said.
   Koreans traditionally feel students are the only selfless group
in society to fight perceived wrongs. They have no families to
support, no jobs to protect.
   Students as well as many citizens cherish the notion of student
uprisings. Three times in this century, student-instigated protests
have challenged governments to force change and three times history
has treated those battling students as heroes.
   Virtually all Koreans can recite student deeds in the 1919
uprising against Japanese colonial rule, in the 1960 toppling of
the government of President Syngman Rhee and the 1987 protests that
opened the door to democratic reforms.
   Wednesay's protests were the largest and most violent since
nationwide anti-government demonstrations nearly three years ago
forced authoritarian President Chun Doo-hwan to carry out major
democratic reforms and step down.
   Radical students feel they have an obligation to confront
authority, to fight the rich, the powerful and the privileged _ the
very group many will join after graduation.
   Radical students dramatize their country's fever for unification
with the communist north, but unlike their elders lack experience
to express concern about conflicts in communist and capitalistic
ideology.
   ``Korea is one!'' they shout at rallies.
   Campuses are adorned with colorful banners two and three stories
high that show radical students astride the border between the two
Koreas.
   None of them are old enough to remember the bloody 1950-53
Korean War, launched by North Korea to communize the south, a war
in which 5 million Americans served. Some of them say they have
never talked to an American.
   The government says most of the radical students are naive
leftists who have been brainwashed by communist North Korean
teachings. Some of them, the government has said, may be communist
agents.
   Many Korean students reach college age without ever having
discussed politics or ideology. Their middle and high school years
are spent slaving over textbooks and rote memorization to pass the
all-important college entrance exam.
   It's with a heady sense of righteousness and indignation that
idealistic young radicals enter the political forum.
   Radicals view the January merger of the ruling party with two
opposition groups as a political coup that altered party alliances
without an election. They support the overthrow of the government
but offer little solid plans on how a new leader could do better.
   Radicals wear American jeans and sneakers, carry their books in
a backpack and look like college students everywhere. They go to
some of the best schools in South Korea.
   The radicals number only about five percent of the roughly 1
million students in college. Other students listen to their
rallies, read their newspapers and may agree with some of their
thinking but usually do not join the militants in their pitched
battles with riot police.
   Radicals claim Washington makes decisions for a Seoul puppet
government. They demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based
in South Korea because they say their presence hinders unification
talks with North Korea.
   The radical movement consists of both men and women students and
is organized vertically with a direct line of authority. Training
retreats are held to indoctrinate recruits.
   At protests, women collect rocks, wave banners, tend to injuries
and sing support songs. Men deployed in platoon fashion hurl
firebombs and rocks.
   The radical student movement lost momentum after President Roh
took office in February 1988 in the country's first direct
presidential elections in 16 years and promised broad democratic
reforms.
   The smaller numbers forced radicals to become more violent to be
noticed. Some began to use homemade explosives.
   The government downplays the significance of violent protests,
but privately worries they could breed discontent among older
Koreans, especially laborers who often feel underprivileged and
underpaid.

<HEAD>Judge Splits Hunting Rights Between Indians, Non-Indians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge, in a decision with
far-reaching consequences, has ruled northern Wisconsin's
``harvestable natural resources'' should be split 50-50 between
Chippewas and non-Indians.
   The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb came
in a lawsuit over Chippewa rights under 19th century treaties to
hunt deer, but state legal experts say the decision extends to
fishing and logging.
   Lawyers for Wisconsin's estimated 4,000 Chippewas had no
immediate comment on the ruling.
   Tom Maulson, a Chippewa active in treaty issues, said the tribe
has supported the idea of sharing resources for years. He said
dividing the resources will not unfairly deprive the Chippewa of
their rights.
   ``I bet the tribe will never touch 50 percent,'' he said. ``We
say the resource is for everybody. Maybe they'll start to realize
that's what we've wanted all along.''
   The ruling came in a case that began with the arrest of two
Chippewas in 1974 for ice fishing off the reservation.
   Mrs. Crabb wrote that equal sharing ``is the fairest result, and
the inevitable one, whatever analysis is employed.''
   She said the Indians' ``needs for a moderate standard of living
dictate their right to a full share of the harvest, subject to a
ceiling set at 50 percent to prevent the frustration of the
non-Indian treaty right.''
   Previously Mrs. Crabb had ruled the Chippewa are entitled to 100
percent of the ``safe allowable'' catch of fish, an allowance the
Indians had never come close to reaching. State lawyers said the
new ruling alters the previous one.
   ``It's our understanding of this decision that it does not apply
only to deer, but that it applies to all natural resources,'' said
Wisconsin Attorney General Donald Hanaway. ``It includes fish, it
includes fur-bearing animals, white tail deer and timber.''
   Under treaties ceding Indian territory to the U.S. government,
Wisconsin's Chippewas retain the right to spear fish, hunt and cut
timber off the reservation on 23,929 square miles of public land in
northern Wisconsin.
   Since a court affirmed those rights in 1983, the Chippewa have
encountered huge and sometimes violent protests by non-Indians who
claim the treaty rights give them an unfair edge and threaten to
deplete fish and timber.
   The Chippewa have filed a series of lawsuits asking the court to
define how much of the resources they are entitled to and to what
degree the state can regulate tribal activities.
   State and tribal officials said that the Chippewa were unlikely
to take 50 percent of the available deer and that the ruling could
provide a model for resolving the dispute over the tribe's rights.
   Dean Crist, spokesman for the anti-treaty rights group Stop
Treaty Abuse, said that Mrs. Crabb's ruling was a good step that
didn't go far enough.
   ``The bad thing is you still have less than 1 percent of the
population with 50 percent of the resource,'' he said. ``It looks
to me like she's trying to court-appoint co-management.''
   Co-management, the sharing of resources that has been used
successfully in Washington state, has been touted by some as a
solution to Wisconsin's dispute.
   Still to be decided are possible financial payments to the
tribes for alleged state infringment on treaty rights.

   The first birth of test-tube tiger cubs
offers hope for the world's endangered tiger population, scientists
say.
   Dr. Lee Simmons said two yellow cubs and one white one were
delivered by Caesarean section April 27 at Henry Doorly Zoo. The
surrogate mother was a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger. The parents, a
male and two females, were Bengals.
   The white cub died shortly after birth from respiratory
complications unrelated to the fertilization. But the
yellow-and-brown striped cubs, a male and female, are healthy and
being hand-reared at the zoo, Simmons said.
   The in-vitro technique, a technology developed on humans,
already has been used for farm animals. An egg and sperm are taken
from animals and combined in a lab dish, and the resulting embryo
is implanted in a surrogate mother.
   Three zoos _ Doorly, the National Zoological Park in Washington
and the Minnesota Zoological Gardens in Minneapolis _ have
collaborated on the project for more than 10 years, beginning with
experiments on house cats, Simmons said.
   The aim of the project is to take the technology into the wild,
where tigers are endangered because of human encroachment. At least
three of eight tiger subspecies have become extinct in the past 20
years, Simmons said.
   In the future, he said, frozen embryos from tigers in Omaha or
other zoos will be used to impregnate females captured in the wild
in places like India or Nepal. The tiger would then be released to
deliver her cubs in the wild.
   The cubs born last month wouldn't be suitable for release
because they were brought up around people, Simmons said. They are
on display at the zoo.
   A project leader, Dr. David Wildt of the National Zoo, hailed
the birth as ``bringing us one step closer to using reproductive
techniques to preserve genetic diversity.''
   Sperm and embryos could be collected from wild animals and
frozen, helping ensure survival of endangered species, the
scientists said.
   John Schalles, a professor of biology at Creighton University,
said the program will likely help some endangered species, but
``the big problem out there is protecting the habitat these animals
live in.''

   The nation's No. 1 supplier of
laboratory mice says it is up to 70 percent capacity after a fire
one year ago today that dealt a blow to medical research projects
around the world.
   The blaze at Jackson Laboratory killed 400,000 mice and
destroyed much of the 29-year-old breeding complex. Now it is
counting on at least $10 million from the National Institutes of
Health for a full recovery.
   ``We'll be at 85 percent by the end of this summer. And we'll be
at 100 percent by the end of 1991 if we get the $10 million from
NIH,'' said Director Kenneth Paigen, who was about to assume the
post when the fire broke out.
   An October report by a panel of consultants convened by NIH said
the blow to Jackson represented ``a significant loss'' to important
national research efforts. The panel urged the government to
provide money to restore the research center quickly.
   JAX mice, as they are known in the scientific community, are
used in research on cancer, AIDS, diabetes, arthritis and thousands
of hereditary diseases.
   The research center, using frozen embryos, can breed mice of
1,700 strains to give scientists the genetic makeup they need for
their experiments.
   The research center, founded in 1929 and struck by a
catastrophic fire in 1947, reported annual shipments of nearly 2
million mice to researchers in all 50 states and 23 foreign
countries before the fire.
   ``About half of our total production went to provide mice that
are unavailable from any other source in the United States,''
Paigen said. ``In the kinds of mice, 95 percent of what's used in
the United States ... is only available'' from Jackson.
   Paigen said the private, non-profit laboratory is unable to say
exactly how much disruption the fire caused to an estimated $600
million to $1 billion in scientific projects, but it's ``a big
chunk.''
   The NIH consultants said some Food and Drug Administration
research had to be re-evaluated, and the Pentagon was said to face
``major impact on the future directions and capabilities'' of its
research.
   For now, the research center is doing some of its work out of
six trailers. Construction is under way on a permanent wing. Plans
envision a series of separate buildings to minimize the impact of
any new calamity.
   ``Fire, health problems, utility breakdowns, tornados. Who knows
what Maine is subject to? We can't lose it all again at one crack,
God willing,'' Paigen said.
   Ironically, research at Jackson itself was largely unaffected by
the fire because scientists there raise their own mice. Some
researchers, however, have had their working quarters ``squeezed
down,'' said Paigen.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Visits Harvard; Urges Hiring of Law Professor</HEAD>

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Harvard Law
School is morally ``on trial'' for its failure to hire a black
woman professor, and he ridiculed the school's claim that few
candidates were available.
   Harvard officials say that 45 percent of the professors given
full tnure at the university in the last decade were women or
minorities.
   The law school, however, has three black men and no black women
among its 60 tenured faculty members. Its administrators say hiring
has been limited by a lack of applicants who have excelled at top
law schools or clerked for the Supreme Court, two traditional pools
for faculty members.
   Jackson, speaking at a rally of 400 students Wednesday, said
those standards were too narrow and elitist.
   ``Harvard University is saying in effect there is no
African-American woman alive who is qualified to teach at our
university. To say (that) in 1990 ... is both an error and a gross
insult to our intelligence,'' Jackson said.
   ``Harvard, at the top of the hill of academia, cannot cast
shadows. It must cast light. In some sense the character of Harvard
is on trial.''
   Derrick Bell, Harvard Law's first tenured black professor,
announced plans last month to take an unpaid leave of absence until
the school hires a minority woman.
   Jackson came to Harvard hoping to mediate the dispute between
Bell and the administration, but Law School Dean Robert C. Clark
rejected the offer.
   Jackson did meet briefly with Clark early Wednesday, however.
   ``We had a very cordial visit. I tried to convey a sense of the
efforts we are making to achieve greater diversity,'' Clark said.
   ``My sense is that he is concerned without a sense of urgency,
(but) there is an emergency here'' Jackson said at a news
conference. ``This matter is not just internal. Injustice anywhere
is a threat to justice everywhere.''
   Tatia Williams, a third-year law student from Washington who
attended the rally, said recruitment of minority teachers is
important for helping minority students succeed.
   ``If you have a homogeneous population of law professors, I
don't think that they can give a perspective that everybody can
relate to,'' she said. ``There's a comfortability factor, when
people have like backgrounds and like lifestyles.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stock Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell moderately against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index edged up slightly.
   The dollar closed at 156.75 yen, down 0.28 yen from Wednesday's
close. It opened at 156.40 yen and traded between 156.37 yen and
156.83 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 24.97-point
loser Wednesday, gained 34.65 points, or 0.11 percent, closing at
30,980.26.
   The dollars's lower opening in Tokyo followed its overnight
plunge in New York, where it fell to 156.50 yen in late trading
from 157.63 yen late Tuesday.
   ``There's no momentum except that the dollar is weakening
against the European currencies,'' said Naohiko Yasuda of the Bank
of Tokyo. ``The yen also is weak against the European currencies.''
   He said the dollar should not weaken much further as many
investors will buy it when it moves lower.
   On the stock market, the yen's strength induced profit-taking on
high-tech, export-oriented issues in the morning, traders said. The
Nikkei index firmed and ended the morning session at 31,241.95, or
296.34 points above Wednesday's close.
   However, the gains were largely erased by large brokers placing
sell orders toward the close, they said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 730 million shares,
down slightly from 753.5 million shares Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds was quoted at 86.55 points at 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT),
compared to Wednesday's close of 86.65. The yield was 7.255
percent, up from 7.235 percent late Wednesday.

   The sailor killed in the blaze aboard the
guided-missile destroyer USS Conyngham roused sleeping crewmates
from their quarters before he was overcome by smoke, a crew member
says.
   Lt. Algernon Pope Gordon Jr., 34, helped evacuate fellow
officers from their berths, which were filled with smoke from the
fire Tuesday morning that began in a boiler room three to four
decks below the berths.
   Gordon rescued one officer, who was among the 18 injured, then
re-entered the smoky area and did not leave it alive.
   The crew member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in
today's Daily Press and Times-Herald of Newport News that he didn't
know why Gordon returned.
   ``He might have thought somebody else was in there,'' he said.
``He was an unselfish individual.''
   Gordon, who was married with three children, was the son of a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Montgomery, Ala. He was in charge of
the ship's combat information center.
   Navy spokesmen said Gordon died of smoke inhalation but would
not give the circumstances of his death.
   Capt. Paul Hanley, a spokeman for the Atlantic Fleet
headquarters in Norfolk, said, ``One of the exceptional efforts by
the ship's crew was in pulling everybody out of the berthing
areas.''
   The fire spread to the command center, leaving the ship
temporarily dead in the water.
   The crew overcame a failure of communications and water-pumping
equipment by using walkie-talkies and hand-held pumps that allowed
fire hoses to draw sea water until other vessels arrived to help,
the Navy said.
   The Navy has not provided a cause of the fire or the amount of
damage.
   The Conyngham was conducting training operations about 100 miles
southeast of Norfolk when the fire started. The 27-year-old vessel,
which was to be decommissioned next year, returned home under tow
early Wednesday.

   As thousands of government employees
walked off their jobs demanding more pay, a top official said the
new government's coffers are empty and it will have to impose harsh
austerity measures.
   ``The situation of bankruptcy is very serious,'' Antonio Lacayo,
minister of the presidency, told a news conference.
   He said President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's Cabinet
ministers had apprised her of the situation on Wednesday.
   Planned steps to try to bring down inflation ``will be deeper,
more serious and more painful for the people and for all the
country,'' said Lacayo, the president's son-in-law.
   Thousands of government employees went on strike Wednesday and
thousands more elsewhere threatened to join them to demand hefty
pay raises to compensate for soaring inflation.
   Employees at the National Assembly turned off the electricity
and the sound system before going on strike, leaving deputies
sitting in the dark, cavernous hall, unable to begin their session.
   The assembly workers were quickly joined by employees at other
government offices, including the labor and foreign ministries.
   Jose Angel Bermudez, a leader of National Federation of Workers,
told a rally of 3,000 government employees his organization was
planning a nationwide strike if Mrs. Chamorro does not do more to
help wage earners. He said the strike could be called later this
week.
   The newly formed independent federation claims a membership of
60,000.
   Bermudez demanded a 200 percent pay increase, which he said will
just cover the basic needs of an average worker's family. He
scoffed at a 60 percent pay raise ordered by Mrs. Chamorro on
Tuesday for the government's 61,000 employees, saying it was
insufficient.
   No government estimates on inflation are available yet for this
year. But the leftist Sandinistas, voted out of office in February,
implemented 31 devaluations along with tough austerity measures to
bring inflation from a record 33,600 percent in 1988 to 1,800
percent last year.
   They devalued the currency eight more times this year before
leaving office.
   Mrs. Chamorro also ordered a sharp devaluation of Nicaragua's
cordoba on Wednesday. She is urging the private sector to go along
with 60 percent increases, but many businessmen complain that they
cannot cover the cost.
   Daniel Ortega, her predecessor, accused Mrs. Chamorro's
administration of pursuing ``a policy of terrorism in the economic
field.''
   The pro-Sandinista newspaper El Nuevo Diario called Mrs.
Chamorro's policy anti-labor, saying that ``while Cabinet ministers
in the new government make up to $5,500 a month, a worker barely
makes $44.''
   It was Mrs. Chamorro's third devaluation in three weeks,
dropping the value of the cordoba 20 percent on the official
market, which handles only a few essential imports such as crude
oil, and 5.1 percent on the parallel exchange, where most of the
money is changed.
   Mrs. Chamorro devalued the cordoba by about half on the parallel
market April 29, four days after she took office, and by another 20
percent on May 5.
   Officials said the devaluations were necessary because the
Sandinistas left Nicaragua broke after 11 years, with only $3
million in the treasury and a foreign debt of $11 billion for a
country of 3.5 million people.
   When the Sandinistas seized power, the cordoba was traded at 10
to the dollar. On Wednesday, 100,000 bought one dollar on the
official market and the parallel market rate was 180,250 to a
dollar.
   The devaluation makes Nicaraguan goods cheaper on foreign
markets, encouraging exports, and makes foreign goods more
expensive in Nicaragua, discouraging the spending of hard currency
for non-essential goods.

   A chartered Northwest Airlines jumbo
jet flew to Japan today nearly 15 hours after being forced to land
for entering the country's air space without permit, an air force
spokesman said.
   Col. Rodolfo Asistente, spokesman of the Philippine air force,
said the Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 took off shortly before 2
p.m. for Tokyo with only its 13 crew members aboard.
   Asistente said its 45 passengers, which were of several
nationalities, decided to remain in Manila and vacation instead of
flying to Singapore, their original destination.
   He said the plane was allowed to leave after securing diplomatic
clearance for entering Philippine air space without permit.
   Asistente said the plane flew from Singapore early Wednesday but
strayed into Philippine air space en route to Tokyo.
   Air force trackers warned the pilots that it had entered
Philippine air space and ordered the plane out, Asistente added.
   The plane changed course and proceeded to Tokyo but on its way
back to Singapore late Wednesday the aircraft again wandered into
Philippine territory and was again warned, Assistente said.
   Asistente said the pilot requested to land at the Manila airport
because the plane was running low on fuel and could not make it to
Singapore if it changed course.
   The intrusion was the second such air space violation this
month. Air force jets intercepted a Nippon Air cargo plane on May 1
after flying over Philippine terrritory with an expired permit.

<TEXT>
   The Mississippi Delta region, the nation's
poorest, has plenty of reserves of hope and could become vital
given enough assistance, a federal commission says.
   The nine-member Delta Commission conducted an 18-month study of
219 of the poorest counties and parishes of Tennessee, Illinois,
Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   ``These are people who prefer hope to despair. This is a region
that, given the right tools and knowledge, can help the nation as a
whole strike a new balance of competitiveness in a global
economy,'' the report's summary said.
   The Commercial Appeal of Memphis obtained a draft of the
commission's report, which was to be presented Monday to the White
House.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who proposed creating the commission
two years ago, questioned where the money to back its plans would
come from.
   ``The federal government and the states and the cities are all
in a terrible fiscal crisis,'' Bumpers said this week.
   The draft report calls for a Delta development bank; a Delta
Common Market, a Memphis-based agricultural technology center,
conventions of Delta religious leaders and multistate economic
planning.
   It seeks federal and state aid _ with a strong emphasis on
volunteerism _ to improve education, highways, ports, health care
and race relations for the region in which 8.3 million people live.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, the commission chairman, wrote in a
letter accompanying the draft that it is a ``handbook for action,''
not simply another government study.
   ``This is not a report that will collect dust. It is very
practical and it can be used by a wide variety of groups and
individuals,'' said Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, a panel member.
   The panel did not put price tags on its recommendations and
cautions that there are no ``quick fixes.''
   ``Not only must the federal government find new ways to invest
in the Lower Mississippi Delta's future, but other levels of
government, the private sector, civic and nonprofit organizations
must step forward,'' the report said.
   Area lawmakers have all but ruled out chances for creation of a
largely federally funded agency such as the Appalachian Regional
Commission.
   The report recommends creation of an interim, state-funded
advocacy group to follow up on findings after the panel dissolves.
The draft leaves to Congress to decide what permanent body would
monitor Delta progress.
   The report's recommendations include:
   _ Seeking federal funds to start a model magnet school in each
Delta state;
   _ Asking area colleges to establish a Delta Higher Education
Association to focus research on area development needs in
aquaculture, wood, alternative fuels and clean coal;
   _ Designating the region as a ``national laboratory'' for
seeking new ways to improve race relations;
   _ Creating an agency to promote regional tourism;
   _ Starting annual meetings of each state's religious leaders,
including a Delta-wide meeting every two years, to mobilize
volunteer efforts;
   _ Designating acquaculture _ catfish, shrimp and crawfish
farming _ as full-fledged agricultural commodities in the 1990 farm
bill;
   _ Providing an additional 400,000 units of housing for
low-income Delta residents by 2001;
   _ Improving major roads in the region;
   _ Expanding Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) by
promising financial incentives to volunteers who work in the
region.;
   The other panel members are Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer; Ed
Jones, a retired congressman from Tennessee; Kentucky Local
Government Commissioner Lee Troutwine, Missouri Agriculture
Department director Charles Kruse; Rhonda Vinson of Southern
Illinois University; Webb Franklin, a former congressman from
Greenwood, Miss., and John Shepherd, a St. Louis lawyer.

<HEAD>Israel Criticizes U.S. over Pro-Arab U.N. Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today criticized
the United States for coordinating with Arab states in drafting a
U.N. resolution opposing settlement of Soviet Jews in occupied
areas.
   ``I am troubled by the activity of the United States when the
Arab countries raise in the U.N. Security Council the issue of
immigration from the Soviet Union,'' Arens said on Israel radio.
   Arens, who indicated U.S.-Israel relations were at a low point,
took the unusual step of summoning U.S. Ambassador William Brown on
Wednesday night to protest the U.S. activity.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud said Israel objected to
the U.S. effort to formulate a resolution because it encouraged
``the Arab attack on the right of Jews to immigrate to Israel.''
   A key paragraph of the working draft composed by non-aligned and
Arab states claims settlement violates international law, a
stronger wording than the U.S. position, which contends settlements
are an obstacle to peacemaking.
   ``Israel's policy and practices of settling part of its
population and new immigrants in those (occupied) territories are
in contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention ... and it is a
serious obstruction to achieving a just and lasting peace in the
Middle East,'' the Arab draft says.
   Israeli officials said there was no policy of settling
immigrants in occupied lands and no basis to suggest such
settlement was illegal under the conventions governing the conduct
of occupying powers.
   Other hard-line sections of the two-page document, which was
read to The Associated Press, state:
   _Palestinian exiles should have the right of return.
   _Aid that could be used for settlement should be withheld.
   _Palestinian civilians should have ``impartial protection.''
   The draft grew out of a call in March by the Soviet Union for a
debate on the settlement of Soviet Jews in occupied territory.
   A U.N. vote on a settlement resolution, which had been scheduled
for today, was postponed with no new date set.
   Israeli officials said the United States should veto the
resolution because it was part of a ``political warfare'' being
waged by Arabs, who are opposed to all immigration to Israel not
just to the war-won lands.
   They argued that Western countries could not support the
resolution without violating their stand in support of freedom of
movement.
   In the past, the United States has vetoed most anti-Israel
resolutions, but officials said that this time U.N. Ambassador
Thomas R. Pickering has been seeking agreed-on language with the
Arabs. He proposed various changes earlier this week to soften the
hard-line sections, but details were no available.
   Arens referred to the increasing strain in Israel-U.S.
relations, saying ``there's no doubt that at this moment we are
going through a period of tension with the United States.''
   He contrasted the troubled relationship with Bush's
administration to the more sympathetic treatment Israel received
under former President Ronald Reagan.
   ``We have had differences of opinion with the United States on
certain subjects for many years, with this administration
especially, in all that is connected to settlements,'' said Arens.
   Despite U.S. expressions of concern, right-wing Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's caretaker government helped fund a Jewish
settlement in Jerusalem's Old City, and started two new ones in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   There are more than 70,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where 1.7 million Arabs live.
   Gad Ben Ari, spokesman for the Jewish Agency which assists
immigrants, said only about 200 Soviet Jews, about one-third of 1
percent, had chosen to live in the occupied territories in the past
year.
   He said about 1,000 had chosen to live in Jerusalem, but no
figures were available on how many are in Israeli-annexed Arab east
Jerusalem, where 120,000 Jews and 130,000 Arabs live.
   About 30,000 Soviet Jews have come to Israel so far this year
and more than 150,000 are expected in the next 12 months.

<HEAD>Premier Announces Measures To Boost Ruling Party Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andrei Lukanov has announced wage
hikes and measures to ease consumer shortages in an apparent
attempt to boost the chances of the ruling former Communist Party
in next month's free elections.
   Lukanov told a news conference Wednesday that minimum monthly
wages will be raised as of June 1, the export of foodstuffs and
other goods in short supply will be banned, and a steep hard
currency tax on imported cars will be abolished.
   The government, which recently suspended payments on Bulgaria's
$10 billion foreign debt, also will try to import food and will
guarantee the jobs of workers at unprofitable companies until after
the elections, Lukanov said.
   While approving free elections and professing to accept full
democracy, the Communists remain in full control in Bulgaria prior
to the elections, scheduled for June 10.
   
   The premier, a leading figure in the re-named Communist party _
now the Socialists, said minimum monthly wages would be raised June
1 from 140 to 170 leva. Under the current official exchange rate,
there are eight to nine leva to the dollar.
   The average wage in Bulgaria at present is about 250 leva.
Before a drastic change in exchange rates decreed this spring, one
dollar officially was worth 2.50 leva.
   By the end of this week, the government will issue a list of
consumer goods that cannot be exported by either Bulgarians or
foreigners, Lukanov said.
   The measure seemed intended to alleviate the fast increasing
food shortages in this traditionally agrarian country of 9 million
people.
   Also, new laws will be passed to punish speculators exporting
consumer goods and to ``alleviate the tension on the internal
market,'' Lukanov said.
   Yugoslavs, Romanians and Greeks are thought to buy up cheap
Bulgarian appliances and other goods for resale at higher prices
abroad. Bulgarians have also engaged in such trading in goods from
the increasingly empty shelves.
   Sugar is the latest scarcity. A shop in Sofia's downtown
Rakowski Street selling several hundred pounds of imported sugar
was besieged by hundreds of citizens on Monday and Tuesday.
   Lukanov said draft legislation on privatizing farmland and
industry will be published ``for public debate'' within the next
few days. Currently, farmers are allowed to own only small plots of
about 1{ acres around their homes with the bulk of agricultural
land in state hands.
   Lukanov also disclosed that Bulgarian geologists had discovered
rich oil fields in central northern Bulgaria around the town of
Pleven.
   The oil deposits are some 13,000 feet deep, the premier said.
Bulgaria is negotiating with foreign firms to exploit the oil
fields, whose exact extent was not revealed.
   Bulgaria, long viewed as the Soviet Union's most loyal ally in
Eastern Europe, is seeking to boost its ties to the West as it
moves away from the hard-line Communist rule of Todor Zhivkov,
ousted November after 35 years in power.
   But the ruling Socialists are cautious about scrapping
centralized economic planning and subsidies and introducing a
totally free market.
   Lukanov praised an accord signed with the European Community
this week to give Bulgarian goods including agricultural produce
and greater access to the EC market. He also said Bulgaria hopes to
join the International Monetary Fund by September 1990.

   Oil rigs disguised as dinosaurs and four
giant red lobsters were the winning entries in a national design
contest to decorate a rundown gasoline station built in the
mid-1950s.
   The jury initially dismissed the lobster motif as ``too
whimsical,'' but ``we kept coming back to it, over and over,'' said
former Mayor Pamela Plumb, one of the judges. ``It would become the
Eiffel Tower of Portland,'' an instant landmark and potential
meeting place, she said.
   ``They're not token lobsters or trite gestures. They're blown up
to a scale where they're truly heroic,'' said Deborah Andrews,
another judge.
   The 60-foot-long and 20-foot-tall lobsters, each resting on a
giant canopy, were designed by Philadelphia architects Willis
Pember and Andrew Blanda.
   That design and the dinosaur entry from Architect William
Collett of Cambridge, Mass., were the winners in the Gateway Gas
Design Competition devised by the C.N. Brown Co., owner of the
dilapidated station.
   The two first-place winners announced Wednesday received $2,000
each. Residents in Portand will have a chance to comment about the
winners and 157 other entries.
   C.N. Brown is not obligated to use any of the designs when it
renovates the station. The contest came about when city planners
balked at the company's bid to use a standard Mobil Oil Corp.
design to replace the existing structure.
   Collett's design pays homage to fossil fuels. The roof is
reminiscent of prehistoric animals and appears to mimic the action
of oil drilling rigs when blown by the wind.

   Bobby Stephenson and his friends needed
something special to compete in the world's largest barbecue
cookoff. So they built a 53-foot-tall, two-ton, steel replica of
the Eiffel Tower.
   The cooking booth is this year's focal point at a Mississippi
River bluff where 175 barbecue teams will spend today through
Saturday cooking 25 tons of pork.
   The party includes a ``Miss Piggie'' beauty contest, a
hog-calling competition and a parade.
   Stephenson said his 22-member group, The Not Ready for Swine
Time Porkers, started working on their blue-and-white tower in
January.
   A 22-foot-square base forms the cooking booth's roof and a
second story observation tower. Next to the booth is a 7-foot-long
steel cooker with three cooking surfaces and plenty of space for a
whole hog.
   ``It got to be a bit more involved that my team had expected it
was going to be,'' Stephenson said.
   This year's contestants come from 22 states and France, Ireland,
Great Britain, Canada and the Soviet republic of Estonia.
   The Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest
is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest
event of its kind anywhere. The listing was based on the 55,747
pounds of pork cooked last year.

   Executives once again declared this
antebellum city by the sea the nation's most mannerly city, capable
of watching its p's and q's even when a most unwelcome guest _
Hurricane Hugo _ dropped in.
   ``With the hurricane and the wonderful recovery you're making,
everyone is in love with Charleston again,'' etiquette expert
Marjabelle Young Stewart said Wednesday.
   ``Everyone just felt the manners under stress and under pressure
was such a thrilling thing for the nation,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Kewanee, Ill.
   Mrs. Stewart bases her annual list on an unscientific survey of
about 2,700 executives who have taken her etiquette courses during
the past three years.
   ``They vote on where they have had great experiences _ on what
type of community that would make you want to go back or to live
there,'' said Mrs. Stewart, who has published 17 books on etiquette.
   Charleston has been represented since Mrs. Stewart began
compiling the list 10 years ago. But the last time the city was No.
1 was four years ago.
   Ranked No. 2 this year is Council Bluffs, Iowa, followed by
Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and last year's top choice,
Portland, Ore.
   Tied for seventh are Rock Island and Moline, Ill., and Davenport
and Bettendorf, Iowa. San Francisco, Denver and Phoenix round out
the top 10.
   Charleston captured the heart of the nation with its recovery
from Hurricance Hugo, Mrs. Stewart said. The hurricane came ashore
Sept. 21, killing 29 people and causing $5.9 billion damage.
   Although Portland slipped out of the top position, that in
itself does not mean the city is doing anything wrong, she said.
It's just that people admire Charleston.
   ``It's like Camelot,'' she said. ``Every time they talk about
Charleston there's a softness and sweetness that says a lot.''

<HEAD>Report: GAO Finds Screening at Borders Inaccurate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer system used at U.S. border crossings
to screen out criminals contains inaccurate information and is
ineffective, congressional investigators have concluded, a
newspaper reported today.
   The system's defects may have resulted in a ``significant
impairment'' of the ability of border agents to prevent criminals
from entering the country, The New York Times said.
   The problem dates back to the creation of the computer records,
investigators with the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm
of Congress, said in a report to a House panel.
   Criminals may enter the country while innocent people may be
stopped and searched at borders, the report said.
   The GAO report, given to the panel in March, was provided to the
Times recently.
   The computer system, Treasury Enforcement Communications System
II, is maintained by the Customs Service.
   Computer terminals linked to the system give customs agents
background information based on the names and automobile license
numbers of people wishing to enter the country.
   The Bush administration has recommended that the computer system
be used as a central repository for information gathered by
agencies that enforce drug laws.
   A Customs Service spokesman challenged the report's findings.
   ``This system is not rife with errors,'' said spokesman Dennis
Shimkoski. He said many of the problems cited by the report had
been identified previously by internal investigators at the Customs
Service and were being corrected.
   The GAO report said no ``lookout records'' had been created in
the computer system for known drug smugglers and other major
criminals. As a result, border guards did not know which suspects
to detain.
   The GAO reviewed files for 70 investigations in which customs
agents had arrested or searched people last June. The report found
that in 65 of those cases, the suspects' names were not entered
into the system even though many of them were drug smugglers, had
tried to enter the country with concealed weapons or were involved
in other major crimes.

<HEAD>Toyota Denies Keeping Pickens' Ads out of Japanese Media</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. denied today that it tried to
prevent Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens from placing ads in local
newspapers in his battle to assert ownership rights in a Japanese
company.
   But several of Tokyo's largest newspapers said they held up the
ads, which claim that collusive business practices force higher
prices on consumers. The papers said they were considering printing
a version that omits company names.
   ``There's no freedom of speech in Japan,'' said Pickens' lawyer,
Kanji Ishizumi. ``Toyota published an ad in a U.S. paper saying
`shut up' to Pickens. They were able to enjoy freedom of speech in
the United States, but Pickens can't do that here.''
   Pickens issued a statement Wednesday in Texas claiming Toyota
and its powerful advertising agency, Dentsu, were trying to block
him from publishing the ads.
   Since last year, Boone Co., a U.S. investment firm, has held the
largest equity stake in Koito Manufacturing Co., a major automobile
parts maker closely linked to Toyota, Japan's largest automaker.
   Pickens says his unsuccessful battle to gain a seat on Koito's
board of directors and to exercise leadership in the company
illustrates how investment opportunities are closed to foreigners
in Japan.
   The Pickens ad is addressed to consumers, auto parts employees
and shareholders of Koito, claiming the Texan's fight ``could be a
major step toward freeing Japanese consumers from artificially high
prices, and returning portions of the profits to the companies'
investors.''
   The ad asks Japanese consumers with any information on ``unfair
practices'' of Toyota, Nissan, Honda or other carmakers to send it
to Pickens in Dallas.
   ``It would never, ever happen _ that Dentsu would pressure the
media not to carry Pickens' advertisement,'' said Jim Sakaguchi of
Toyota's international affairs department. ``We have never
discussed this matter with Dentsu.''
   Pickens' statement said: ``Our ads were accepted, but we have
now been told that there won't be any space available for several
more weeks because Toyota's advertising firm, Dentsu, is buying up
all available space.''
   Dentsu, the world's largest advertising agency, places more than
20 percent of the ads in major newspapers and almost one-third of
ads in major magazines.
   In his book ``The Enigma of Japanese Power,'' Karel van Wolferen
wrote that Dentsu helps shelter big business from the scrutiny of
consumers.
   ``Dentsu is able to apply enormous pressure on the media not to
report, or to downplay, incidents that might harm the prestige of
its clients,'' Wolferen wrote.
   The ad was to have been published Wednesday in the Asahi
Shimbun's edition in Hokkaido, in northern Japan. A worker in the
advertising section said the ad had been ``delayed.''
   Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, said it was
considering running the ad without references to Toyota and Honda,
two of the newspaper's principal advertising clients.
   ``We don't want to get involved in anything that upsets our
major clients. That's how we support our business,'' said Ikuo
Terai of the paper's advertising department.
   Terai said the paper refused the Pickens' ad twice because it
didn't want to publish a ``personal dispute'' between Pickens and
Koito.
   Representatives from the Mainichi Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun said
the ads had been delayed but that they would run by May 16, with
references to Toyota and Honda deleted from the original text.

   Ramona Africa remains imprisoned five years
after she survived a fire that killed 11 fellow members of the
radical group MOVE, refusing to renounce her beliefs even though
doing so would mean freedom.
   Ms. Africa, the only adult to survive the blaze touched off when
Philadelphia police bombed MOVE's rowhouse, stays in an
8-by-10-foot cell at a prison for women, where she has fought
losing battles large and small against ``the system.''
   She wants freedom to associate with MOVE friends, but her
refusal to renounce her ``family'' keeps her in her cell. And she
wants to be known as Ramona Africa, a last name MOVE members
generally adopt. But ``the system'' makes her use the name Ramona
Johnson.
   ``According to your law, we have the right to speak freely and
to demonstrate freely,'' Ms. Africa said in a prison interview.
``But because the police department and every agency of this system
are designed to protect the institutions of this system, they are
not going to support MOVE.''
   On May 13, 1985, MOVE and police transformed a quiet
neighborhood into a combat zone. Gunfire rang out for hours and a
bomb dropped in an attempt to dislodge a bunker atop MOVE
headquarters started a fire that destroyed 61 homes and left 270
people homeless.
   Eleven MOVE members, including five children, were killed in the
attempt by police to evict them for harassing neighbors with
foul-mouthed revolutionary rhetoric blared through a bullhorn at
all hours.
   Memorials are planned for Friday and Saturday in Philadelphia.
   ``If people knew the truth about MOVE, they would not stand for
this system treating us the way it does,'' Ms. Africa said.
   Those among the 14 imprisoned MOVE leaders who are eligible for
parole have been told they can get out if they renounce the
organization. None has agreed. Ms. Africa was eligible for parole
five months after being sentenced in 1986.
   According to Ms. Africa, MOVE _ whose name stands for nothing in
particular _ was once a peaceful but misunderstood group protesting
in the '70s against abuse of animals, the elderly and the
environment. ``The system'' made it mean.
   In 1978, in the group's first serious brush with the law, a
policeman was slain in an attempt to evict MOVE from a house.
   ``We don't say that MOVE is innocent and expect people to just
accept it,'' Ms. Africa said. ``Our innocence is documented all
through the court records.''
   Ms. Africa, who considered going to law school after becoming
involved with MOVE, had been selected the group's spokeswoman
before the 1985 battle.
   ``She was very articulate, direct and non-hostile,'' recalled
Michael Nutter, who attempted to mediate the 1985 dispute between
MOVE and police.
   Nutter said Ms. Africa spoke in calm, reassuring tones and asked
questions of him that he could not answer. ``She put forth
intelligent questions, asking me what I would do in the same
situation,'' Nutter said.
   She still asks the same kinds of questions, calmly inquiring
what other steps she could take against a society that imprisoned
people she says are innocent.
   As for her personal battles, Ms. Africa said nothing less than
her identity is at stake.
   Mail addressed to ``Ramona Africa'' is returned undelivered with
a note saying no such person is lodged there. Consent forms for
interviews, tape recorders and photographs come back to her if she
doesn't sign the name Johnson.
   ``Is it worth it?'' she asked. ``Being right is worth it.''

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court reinstated a libel suit filed
by a cargo airline once controlled by the CIA against a television
station over a report that the airline's planes carried drugs.
   The evidence tended to show that WPLG-TV, Miami's ABC affiliate,
didn't give the airline ``a fair opportunity'' to respond to the
drug allegations in a series aired in 1987, the 3rd District Court
of Appeal ruled.
   The ruling Tuesday reversed a Dade Circuit Court decision
dismissing the case and ordered a trial on defamation claims by
Miami-based Southern Air Transport.
   Southern Air received widespread publicity before the series as
a supplier for U.S.-based Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's ruling
Sandinistas.
   The station's report included an informer's statement that she
watched as drugs were loaded on a Southern Air plane in Colombia.
The same woman repeated the allegations before a U.S. Senate
committee.
   Other defendants in the case are the station owner Post-Newsweek
Stations of Florida, reporter Susan Candiotti and four others
involved in the series production.

<TEXT>
   India today rejected negotiations with
the United States over removing India from an American ``hit list''
of countries targeted for unfair trading practices.
   India is not going to be ``intimidated or policed'' by anybody
on the issue of country's sovereignty and economic independence,''
Commerce Minister Arun Nehru told the national Parliament.
   Nehru's statement marked the first time Indian officials have
openly rejected negotiations with the United States over the trade
issue.
   On April 27, President Bush cited India under a 1988 law that
provides for economic sanctions if protective trade barriers are
not eliminated. Bush removed Japan and Brazil from the list,
leaving India the only country on it.
   India has steadfastly refused to modify its restrictive trade
policies, designed to protect domestic industries by limiting
foreign investment and imposing high import duties.
   Nehru said India will not enter into either ``secret or open''
negitiations with the United States under threat of retaliation.
   Under the 1988 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act, Washington could levy
tariffs of up to 100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged
an unfair trader.
   Under former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, India began a program
of relative economic liberalization, opening up to limited foreign
investment. But India's new government, led by Prime Minister V.P.
Singh, has shown few signs of continuing those policies.
   Singh's Cabinet includes some socialists who regularly denounce
Gandhi's liberalizations. The government has rejected an investment
proposal by Coca-Cola Co. and vowed to investigate an investment
project backed by PepsiCo.

<TEXT>
   China said today that it freed a second large
group of protesters arrested for roles in last year's pro-democracy
movement, including leading journalist Dai Qing and several famous
academics.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 211 ``lawbreakers ... have
been given lenient treatment and released upon completion of
investigations.''
   Thousands of students, workers and others who took part in
massive marches in Beijing and other cities were detained after the
army's attacked protesters in the capital on June 4, killing
hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   The releases come shortly before President Bush must decide
whether to renew China's ``most favored nation'' trading status,
which entitles it to lower tariffs.
   The United States grants most-favored-nation status to almost
all countries, but Bush can deny it if a country does not allow its
citizens freedom to travel.
   Some U.S. congressmen have indicated they favor lifting China's
most-favored-nation status to protest its overall human rights
record. The prison releases and the lifting of martial law in Tibet
last week both appeared intended to placate such critics.
   The government announced in January that it had released 573
people, the only other large group to be freed.
   Xinhua quoted an unidentified spokesman for the Public Security
ministry as saying 431 people remain in custody and under
investigation. The report did not elaborate and the 431 presumably
does not include those tried and sentenced.
   The official media has reported 20 executions of people who took
part in the protests and violent clashes with the army and police,
and the government has denied Western reports of other, secret
executions.
   Few other sentences have been made public, and none of the
trials have been open to foreign journalists.
   Dai Qing, a journalist for Guangming Daily, said she was
released Wednesday.
   ``Coming back home was like a dream. After 10 months, my kitchen
is like a stranger,'' she said, contacted by telephone at her home
in Beijing. She declined to speak further, saying she would be
arrested again if she spoke to reporters without permission.
   Sources have said Ms. Dai and other leading intellectuals were
held at Qincheng Prison in western Beijing, and were generally well
treated.
   She had made an emotional but unsuccessful appeal to the
students to quit their occupation of central Beijing's Tiananmen
Square days before the army crackdown.
   Also released was Cao Siyuan, former director of a research
institute under the Stone Corp., China's leading computer company,
and an adviser to ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. Zhao
was purged last summer for allegedly supporting the democracy
movement and ``splitting the party.''
   Zhou Duo, also of Stone Corp., one of four non-students who
staged a hunger strike in the square on June 2, also was released.
Only one of the hunger strikers, Liu Xiaobo, remains in jail, and
sources have said he has been charged with counterrevolutionary
incitement.
   The Public Security Ministry spokesman said protesters still in
prison would be dealt with leniently if they ``show a good attitude
... make voluntary confessions and show repentance.''
   ``Those who obstinately stick to a wrong course ... and continue
to do evil will surely be punished strictly,'' he said.
   Also today, Cable News Network owner Ted Turner said he believed
the Chinese government ``felt forced to'' call in troops last year
to end the pro-democracy movement.
   In a speech to foreign journalists, Turner also accused the
United States of interfering in the affairs of other nations.
   ``The thing that drives me most crazy and makes me most
embarrassed is the fact that our leaders feel they have the right
to interfere in the affairs of other countries and tell them what
to do,'' he said. ``I personally don't feel that's done a bit of
good.''
   He added: ``You catch more flies with honey.''
   Turner's CNN played an important role in showing the world the
events of last spring, when students, intellectuals and workers,
sometimes in the hundreds of thousands, took to the streets every
day for seven weeks demanding political reforms and an end to
corruption in government.
   In another development today, about three dozen Chinese
demonstrated outside the Australian Embassy in Beijing to demand
refunds of thousands of dollars from Australian schools. The
protesters said they paid tuition and board money in advance to the
English-language schools, but later were refused visas and could
not attend.
   Diplomats inside the embassy refused to come out to talk to the
students.
   ``We're simply not willing to cooperate in a staged publicity
event,'' embassy spokesman Grant Thompson said later in an
interview inside the embassy.

<HEAD>Europe's Last Hard-Line Communist Country Announces Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania has announced it will ease
restrictions on travel and religion as part of a package of laws
representing a break from the country's Stalinist traditions.
   Europe's last hard-line Communist country also said it wants to
join the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, in a further move from its decades-long policy of
isolationism.
   The proposed reforms were announced before the Albanian
Parliament on Tuesday, and a report on the meeting, carried by the
state ATA news agency, was made available to The Associated Press
in Vienna on Wednesday.
   The moves come before an expected visit to Albania on Friday by
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   In a speech to the Parliament, Deputy Premier Manush Myftiu said
a new law was being drafted that would allow any Albanian to hold a
passport to travel abroad. Ordinary Albanians have been forbidden
to travel outside the country for more than 40 years.
   He did not say when the travel law would be ready or whether
there would be any other conditions for travel. It was not clear
whether the move was part of the country's bid to join the European
security conference process.
   Myftiu also indicated that the death penalty would no longer be
applied to people attempting to flee the country illegally. He said
that ``defection,'' which remains an offense, would no longer be
treated as a capital crime involving betrayal of the country.
   Myftiu added that Albania would no longer punish people for
spreading ``religious propaganda'' and ease laws banning
anti-socialist agitation.
   Albania's Communist leaders have vigorously promoted atheism.
Under its former Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha, Albania banned all
faiths and closed all houses of worship.
   Hoxha also pursued a policy of isolationism, shunning relations
with both superpowers. Albania, which broke with the Soviet Union
and the Warsaw Pact in the 1960s, refused to join the European
security conference, charging it meant interference in the
countries internal affairs.
   But since Hoxha's death in 1985, his successor, Communist Party
chief Ramiz Alia, has moved gradually to re-establish contacts
abroad and introduce new policies at home.
   Last month, the Communist leadership signaled Albania's
willingness to resume relations with Moscow and Washington and to
establish ties with the European Economic Community.
   At Tuesday's session of Parliament, Premier Adil Carcani said
his country wanted to join the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   He emphasized the country's ``desire to join the process of
European Cooperation and Security and render our possible
contribution to its process.''
   Carcani's statement was believed to be the first such public
pronouncement by an Albanian leader. Senior officials had
previously only hinted that Albania might now consider joining the
conference.
   The conference _ which first met in 1975 in Helsinki, Finland _
groups 35 nations: all the European nations, except Albania, as
well as the United States, Canada and the Soviet Union.
   At the Helsinki meeting, the nations signed a key accord on
European security issues, economic cooperation and human rights.
   At later conference meetings, the countries adopted
supplementary documents that helped stir popular demands for human
rights in Eastern European countries where Communist regimes were
toppled in dramatic revolutions last year.
   One of the key points in the Helsinki accords is the right to
free travel.
   Albania, wedged between Yugoslavia and Greece, has about 3.1
million residents.

   The homicide rate in the nation's capital
declined for the first four months of the year, law enforcement
officials say.
   As of May 1, there were 152 homicides in the city, 8.5 percent
less than at the same time last year, when there were 165. Had
slayings increased at the same rate as the two previous years,
there would have been more than 250 people killed in the city by
May 1.
   A year ago this month, there were 55 percent more killings than
at the same time in 1988. The rate of increase between May 1987 and
May 1988 was the same.
   D.C. Police Chief Isaac Fulwood Jr. said Wednesday he doesn't
want to read too much into the statistics. He noted that a few bad
nights of violence could send the homicide tally soaring. ``It's
just too early to tell,'' Fulwood said.
   American University criminologist James Fyfe said one possible
reason for the slight decrease in slayings is what sociologists
call the ``ceiling effect.''
   ``You hit a peak and you can't go much higher because there is
only a limited pool of people who are committing the homicides or
are subject to being victims of homicides,'' Fyfe said. ``This
small group of people who account for the number of homicides are
wearing themselves out.''

   East German teachers, factory workers and
farmers held protests nationwide today to demand job security when
their nation unites with West Germany.
   Teachers closed classrooms, textile and leather workers shut off
their machines, and farmers in tractors blocked border crossings
into West Germany in the latest and largest demonstrations by an
increasingly restive workforce.
   The protests came as lawmakers met to discuss the status of
negotiations with West Germany on merging the two nations.
   There have been growing signs of a split in recent days in the
coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats, the junior partners in the
coalition, are demanding more social guarantees to protect workers
from the loss of jobs and benefits when the nation shifts quickly
to a free-market economy.
   Thousands of teachers held two- to four-hour warning strikes
this morning in East Berlin, Frankfurt and der Oder, Magdeburg,
Neubranderburg, Hohenschoenhausen, Rostock and Halle, the
government news agency ADN said.
   About 2,000 kindergarten, primary school and college teachers
marched through East Berlin to the Parliament building, where
lawmakers were convening.
   The marchers demanded job and benefits security.
   Farm workers blocked highway border crossings at the East German
cities of Magdeburg, Eisenach and Rudolphstein, police said.
Traffic was snarled for about an hour in the latest of several
blockades held by farm workers.
   After the protests started, Parliament Secretary Guenther Krause
said discussions would begin next week with the 600,000-member farm
workers union and eventually all labor organizations, ADN said.
   The farm workers are fearful of job losses from Western
competition and the transition of state-owned land to the private
sector.
   Thousands of leather and textile workers in Leipzig, Dresden and
Chemnitz shut off their machines for an hour to call attention to
their fear of Western imports, ADN said.
   East Germans have been buying better-made Western imports since
the borders between the nations were opened in November, after the
Stalinist regime was ousted.
   Last month, workers at a chocolate factory began selling their
goods door-to-door because East German shops were buying cheaper,
better-tasting West German chocolate.
   Economists predict that many inefficient East German factories
will close in the next year and that between 500,000 and 2 million
East German workers will lose their jobs.
   On Wednesday, the Ministry for Labor and Social Affairs said the
number of unemployed rose from 38,313 in March to 64,948 last month.
   The unemployed included 36,000 skilled workers, 16,000 unskilled
workers and 12,000 unemployed who have recently left school,
according to the figures distributed by ADN.
   East Germany once had one of the strongest economies in the
Soviet bloc, but since the beginning of the 1980s has been plagued
by growing inefficiency.
   East Germany and West Germany plan to merge their economies and
social institutions by July 2, when the West German mark will
become the currency of East Germany.
   In Bonn, West Germany, today, Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressured
East Germany to show greater flexibility in negotiations over
unification and told Parliament that ``a series of important
questions'' needs to be resolved before the two nations can seal
their planned merger.

   Winterlike weather moved into the Plains, while much of the East
and Midwest had rain early today.
   Frost and freezing warnings went up in the northern and central
Plains. A snow advisory was posted in Upper Michigan, where 6
inches of snow fell by this morning at Marquette and several more
inches were expected. Up to 5 inches fell across northern and
eastern Wisconsin, and in Hartford, Wis., the mayor declared a
state of emergency because of downed tree limbs and power lines.
   Major flooding continued, and a flood warning remained in place
for the Red River in the border area of Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered from Michigan across
Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina and
Florida.
   Showers were scattered from Kansas into South Dakota. Snow,
often mixed with rain, extended from northeast Wisconsin to central
Upper Michigan.
   In parts of the upper Midwest, heavy rains Wednesday, on top of
storms earlier in the spring, were credited with boosting soil
moisture to near-normal levels after years of drought.
   ``It's dandy!'' said Veryl Schewe, a manager at the Alden Coop
Elevator eight miles west of Albert Lea, Minn. ``We'll take all the
moisture we can get.'' Drought problems continue in other farming
regions such as the northern Plains.
   In Texas, several record highs were set for the date Wednesday;
Austin reached 96 degrees and Brownsville 93.
   Today's forecast called for showers in parts of California and
Nevada and snow in Wisconsin and Michigan. Rain was predicted in
the Lake Michigan area, and showers changing to thundershowers were
expected from New England to Florida.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 102 at Laredo, Texas.

<HEAD>Thousands Greet Mandela's Arrival In Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela today arrived in Luanda
where he was expected to brief Angolan leaders on recent talks with
the South African government designed to pave the way for
black-white power sharing.
   In a three-day visit, the anti-apartheid leader was also
expected to thank the leaders of Angola for supporting his African
National Congress in its struggle against white-minority rule in
South Africa.
   Thousands of cheering Angolans greeted Mandela, on the first leg
of a six-nation tour that will include Nigeria, Libya, Algeira,
Egypt and Zambia.
   The black leader is making his first visit to the Southwest
African nation since his release February 11 from 27 years
imprisonment.
   Angola is one of six so-called frontline states opposed to the
apartheid system of white-minority rule in South Africa. After
independence from Portugal in 1975, the Marxist leaders allowed the
ANC to operate bases in Angola.
   Since 1975 the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola has fought a civil war in a bid to share power. The
group, known as UNITA, was formerly supported by South Africa.
   But under a 1988 regional peace accord, South Africa agreed to
end aid to UNITA and granted independence to Angola's southern
neighbor, Namibia. Cuba also agreed to withdraw troops backing the
Angolan government.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos joined the crowds
awaiting Mandela at Luanda's February 4 airport.
   Traditional dancers lined the route from the airport. Mandela
visited the tomb of Agostinho Neto, the guerrilla leader who led
Angola to independence and became its first president until his
death in 1979.
   Dos Santos presented Mandela with Angola's highest honor, the
Order of Agostinho Neto, and Mandela laid a wreath on Neto's tomb.
   In February, South African President F.W. de Klerk ordered
Mandela's release from prison and legalized the ANC, 30 years after
it was banned. The measures came under de Klerk's moves toward
reform of the apartheid system.
   De Klerk and Mandela last week agreed to work together to end
political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on a
new constitution that would include South Africa's 28 million
disenfranchised blacks.
   Mandela's arrival in Angola came one day after de Klerk began a
nine-nation European tour aimed at gaining international support
for his reforms.

   A lawsuit to abolish runoff elections might help
Andrew Young become Georgia's first black governor, but then again
it might be the ``kiss of death,'' political analysts say.
   Twenty-seven legislators, civil rights leaders and others filed
the federal lawsuit to end runoffs in most statewide and regional
elections. They said Wednesday its aim is to boost black voting
power, not help Young's campaign.
   ``This is not about candidates who are running this time,'' said
state Rep. Billy McKinney.
   Georgia is one of nine states, eight of them in the South, that
require candidates to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the
primary or else face a runoff.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, contends runoffs violate the 1965
Voting Rights Act by diluting black voting strength.
   The runoff requirement ``forces you to run twice to win once,''
said state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, the lead plaintiff. ``The law was
enacted to deny black people access to the political process.''
   It wasn't known whether the lawsuit would be settled before the
July 17 primaries. No hearing was immediately scheduled.
   Young, former Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador, is the leading
candidate for the Democratic primary, but recent polls give him
only about 30 percent of the vote.
   If Young were to win the primary without having to prove himself
in a runoff, he would be in ``the weakest possible position'' going
into the general election, said Emory University political science
professor Merle Black.
   ``Young would have the immediate political problem of attracting
white votes. Anyone who wins the primary with only 30 percent of
the vote has simply not demonstrated an ability to unite the
party,'' Black said.
   Georgia's population is an estimated 27 percent black.
   Pollster Claibourne Darden called the lawsuit ``the closest
thing to the kiss of death to the state Democratic Party than
anything they could do,'' and said it would boost the chances of
Johnny Isakson, the Republican frontrunner.
   Georgia has not had a GOP governor since Reconstruction.
   Young said he wants to win the Democratic nomination under the
current rules to ensure unity against the Republican nominee.
   Charlie Schroder, executive director of the Democratic Party of
Georgia, said he thinks the elimination of the runoff would be ``a
travesty'' because candidates could win election with a small
percentage of votes.
   ``The biggest loser in all of this is not the Democratic or
Republican Party _ it's the voters of Georgia,'' he said.
   Alec Poitevint, chairman of the Georgia GOP, said he didn't know
whether the Republicans had anything to gain from the elimination
of runoffs.
   Lt. Gov. Zell Miller and state Sen. Roy Barnes, two of Young's
Democratic opponents who are both white, said they opposed the
lawsuit.
   ``I favor runoffs, and I believe they are constitutional,''
Miller said. ``If you read that great document you'll see in
several places where a majority vote is mentioned.''
   Tuesday's lawsuit is the second major federal case involving
Georgia election laws. The U.S. Justice Department last month
declared unconstitutional the state's method of electing some
Superior Court judges.

<HEAD>Rebels Urge U.N.-Sponsored Referundum in Eritrea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean rebels today appealed for a
U.N.-sponsored referendum to determine the future of Ethiopia's
northernmost province.
   ``It is the only option to bring about a peaceful solution, and
thereby ensure the basic rights of the Eritrean people to
self-determination,'' rebel radio said in a clandestine broadcast
monitored in Nairobi.
   The statement by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front said the
nearly 30-year-old secessionist war was not merely Ethiopia's
internal matter but a war of independence ``for which the world
community will be held responsible.''
   The rebels took up arms in 1962 to press for the independence of
Eritrea province, a former Italian colony federated to Ethiopia in
1952 by a resolution at the United Nations.
   Eritrean rebels say the late Emperor Haile Selassie annexed the
territory to his empire through bribery and threats to legislators,
who then voted to join Ethiopia.
   The broadcast said the Liberation Front ``calls on the United
Nations, as a representative of the world community and legitimate
organ responsible for the Eritrean issue, to conduct, that is, to
supervise, a referendum.''
   It described as ``illegitimate'' President Mengistu Haile
Mariam's proposal for autonomy as an alternative to Eritrea's
independence.
   Last year, the Ethiopian government agreed to peace talks with
the rebels but said any solution to the conflict must result in a
unified Ethiopia.
   In two sessions of preliminary talks presided over by former
President Jimmy Carter late last year, the rebels and the
government agreed to enter into substantive talks with each side
choosing two observers.
   However, the talks so far have failed to materialize because the
United Nations declined observer status on the Eritrean side,
saying it could not involve itself in what it considered a member
state's internal problem.
   The rebels' appeal for the referendum came at a time when they
appear to have an upper hand in the fighting.
   In February, the Eritreans launched their largest offensive in
Africa's longest continuous civil war and captured the Red Sea port
of Massawa, one of Ethiopia's two harbors.

<TEXT>
   Word that hundreds of thousands of Americans
watch TV at work may trouble their bosses, but it was welcome news
to network executives.
   An A.C. Nielsen Co. study released Wednesday by ABC estimated
that more than 1 million TV viewers aren't counted by current
rating methods because they watch at work, in bars or other places,
and not at home.
   ``These findings reinforce the need for improved measurement
methods that accurately reflect how viewers really use television
today in today's media environment,'' ABC research chief Alan
Wurtzel said in a statement.
   The one-week study, made in November and conducted among 4,196
people, was sponsored by NBC, Nielsen, ABC and cable's ESPN sports
channel. About 53 percent of the 4,196 completed the viewing
diaries used in the study, ABC said.
   The study gave no margin of error.
   About 36 percent of those who completed the diaries watch TV at
work, and 21 percent tune in in hotels and motels, the study said.
Sixteen percent watch in bars and restaurants, 9 percent in second
homes and 15 percent in ``other places.''
   Nielsen, whose ratings represent 92.1 million homes with
televisions, doesn't count viewers in such places as bars, hotels
or college dormitories.
   Major networks have been losing viewers to cable, independent
stations and the Fox network of 129 stations. CBS, NBC and ABC,
which once had a 90 percent share of the viewing audience, last
season accounted for a combined 65 percent.

   Residents returning to the fire-blackened
Au Sable River valley were baffled by a wildfire that swept through
eight miles of forest, sparing some homes but reducing others to
smoking ash.
   The fire blackened an estimated 6,000 acres of northern Michigan
and destroyed an estimated 66 homes before yielding Wednesday to
firefighters and a spring storm. Yet it seemingly hopped over
individual houses.
   ``I can't believe it took one, left one, took one,'' said Steven
Horton, 34, as he stood Wednesday in the ashes of his father's
house and looked at the unscathed home next door.
   Several miles down the road, Ed Biroth stood in his soot pile of
a yard and tried to explain why his vacation house was one of the
saved. Its clean aluminum siding gleamed in the blackened forest.
   ``It's a house on a prairie ... a big, black prairie,'' Biroth
said.
   Norbert Szkotnicki didn't rely on chance to save his riverside
home. He said he sneaked past police barricades to check on it and
found part of it burning.
   ``I got a chain saw and cut off a (burning) corner of the
cabin,'' he said. Then he joined a bucket brigade from the river up
the hill to his house until firefighters arrived and saved the
cabin.
   ``My family has been here 110 years. My grandfather built that
house,'' he said. ``I wasn't going to lose it.''
   The Au Sable fire, blamed on a trash or brush fire that got out
of hand, cut an eight-mile path of black through the forest before
dying to a smolder. An estimated 150 firefighters, foresters and
National Guard soldiers battled the fire; one firefighter was
treated for smoke inhalation.
   Crawford County officials pegged the loss at $2.4 million.
   A second fire 10 miles to the south charred an additional 450
acres and claimed nine homes Wednesday, authorities said.
   The area's year-round population is relatively sparse but grows
when cabin owners visit for the summer and fall.

   The World Health Organization today indefinitely
deferred a bid by the PL0's self-declared State of Palestine to
become a full voting member, averting the threat of a withdrawal of
U.S. funds.
   The United Nation agency's annual assembly adopted a resolution
sponsored by 28 West European, Third World and moderate Arab
countries that urged WHO's director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima,
to ``continue his studies'' on the membership bid and to report
back ``at an appropriate time.''
   By not setting a deadline, the 167-nation assembly in effect
indefinitely postponed consideration of the PLO's bid.
   The measure also urged the health organization to continue a
special health program to help Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   The agreement was a diplomatic victory for the United States and
a new blow for the PLO's campaign to gain universal recognition as
an independent state by becoming a full member of international
agencies. The PLO currently has non-voting observer status with the
World Health Organization.
   More than 100 countries, many in the Third World, have
recognized the Palestinian state declared by the PLO's
parliament-in-exile in November 1988. This roughly encompasses the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The United States, backed by most Western countries, maintains
that the PLO is not entitled to full membership in U.N.
organizations because it fails to meet internationally recognized
criteria of statehood, including control of territory.
   Washington is pledged to contribute $78 million to the health
organization this year, or 25 percent of the agency's regular
budget. It is also a major funder of other organization programs,
including the campaign against AIDS.
   U.S. officials said a cutoff of U.S. funds would be
``devastating,'' and Nakajima had warned that all major programs,
such as the fight against tropical diseases, would have to be
slashed.

<TEXT>
   The son of the man who first climbed
Mount Everest reached the peak of the world's highest mountain
today, following an American team and members of a three-nation
peace climb to the crowded summit.
   Peter Hillary, son of mountaineer Edmund Hillary, reached the
top of the 29,029-foot peak 37 years after his father and sherpa
guide Tenzing Norgay pioneered the way. It was his fourth attempt.
   Hillary, 36, followed the traditional southeastern route first
used by his father. He reached the top at 7:30 a.m. with the two
leaders of an eight-member New Zealand team, their base camp
reported by radio. The message said the trio was accompanied by a
Nepalese sherpa guide, Apa Sherpa, 33.
   ``It's been a bit of a struggle over the years, but we're
thrilled to bits that you're finally standing on top of the old
mountain,'' Sir Edmund told Peter by satellite telephone from
Auckland.
   Hillary said it had been a long, hard morning and he was feeling
``absolutely over the moon'' at reaching the summit.
   ``It's very, very cold up here. I've been having difficulty
keeping some of my extremities, my hands warm so I'm going to be
heading down as soon as I can,'' he said.
   The team aimed to return to the South Col camp, about 3,000 feet
from the summit on the south side of the mountain.
   Most of the climbers were using oxygen.
   Sir Edmund was made a knight of the British Empire for his
exploit four decades ago. He has retained a long association with
Nepal and has led aid projects there, building schools and
hospitals to improve the lives of the Sherpa people.
   His wife and daughter were killed in a plane crash in Nepal in
1975.
   Since Sir Edmund reached the summit of Mount Everest, many
climbers have followed in his footsteps. Their expeditions have
left behind an estimated two tons of trash, including empty oxygen
bottles and cans. The summit, which can handle only about 20
climbers at a time, is sometimes nearly crowded.
   Minutes before the younger Hillary completed his feat today,
five Americans _ three lawyers, a geologist and a mountain guide _
reached the peak, the Nepalese Tourism Ministry said.
   The five Americans were members of an 11-member team that also
followed the traditional southeastern route.
   The American climbers are Peter George Alhams, a 32-year-old
mountain guide from Snow Bird, Utah; Dana Quentin Coffield, a
31-year-old geologist from Columbia, S.C.; and lawyers Glenn
Porzak, 41, of Boulder, Colo.; Michael Browning, 37, of Manitou
Springs, Colo.; and Brent Manning, 39, of Salt Lake City. They were
accompanied by two Nepalese Sherpa guides, the ministry said.
   Meanwhile, a Belgian Everest expedition abandoned its attempt on
the same route Thursday after the regulator of an oxygen cylinder
burst, the ministry said.
   On April 24, five members of a Nepalese army expedition climbed
Everest.
   And three days ago, climbers from a three-nation team _ the
United States, China and the Soviet Union _ scaled Everest from its
northern side through Tibet. Six climbers in the fourth and last
group from the expedition reached the summit today, China's
official news agency reported. Included in the group was American
Mark Scott Tucker. There was no hometown listed for Tucker.
   The climbers have been filling duffle bags with garbage left by
previous expeditions and taking it back down the mountain.
   Expeditions from Switzerland and Australia are still on the
mountain, waiting in line for a chance to reach the top.

<HEAD>Defense Ministry Denies Sale of Soviet Weapons to United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry today denied
involvement in the secret sale of advanced Soviet military
technology to the United States for 10 years prior to the overthrow
of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified ``intelligence
sources'' in Washington and abroad, reported Sunday that the
program was coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   It said the program resulted in more than $40 million being paid
to Romania through foreign middlemen and that about 20 percent of
that ended up in Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Ceausescu
family.
   In a statement carried by the state-run Rompres news agency, the
Defense Ministry said some of the technology referred to in the
Post article ``has never been'' in the inventory of the Romanian
military.
   The Post said the Ceausescu connection was part of a larger
weapons-buying operation that allowed the U.S. military to obtain
the latest versions of Soviet made weapons and air defense systems.
   On Monday, The New York Times quoted unidentified current and
former U.S. officials as confirming the reports.
   Stephen Hart, a deputy White House spokesman, has declined to
discuss the report, saying: ``We don't comment on intelligence
matters.''
   The Post said the latest version of a Soviet antiaircraft system
was among the items purchased from Romania, which also sold mobile
rocket launchers and radar systems.
   ``The Romanian Ministry of National Defense makes it known ...
that it did not know and does not know of operations like those
mentioned,'' the statement said.
   The Romanian operation ended with Ceausescu's overthrow and
execution in December, the Post reported.
   The newspaper said contacts in other East bloc countries had
also been used in the purchase of Soviet-made weapons systems. On
Monday, Hungary's Defense Ministry also denied any involvement.
   The Romanian statement did not mention former Deputy Defense
Minister Ilie Ceausescu, one of Ceausescu's brothers, who was said
in the U.S. report to be directly involved in the operation.
   Ilie Ceausescu, an army general, has been in custody awaiting
trial for his role in attempting to put down the revolution that
toppled his brother.

<HEAD>Brother of American Detained in Vietnam Appeals For His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American businessman urged Vietnamese
authorities today to release his brother, who has been detained in
Vietnam for 18 days.
   Peter Morrow told reporters that his brother, Michael, a Hong
Kong-based publisher, was taken into custody by Vietnamese security
personnel in central Danang on April 23 and taken to Ho Chi Minh
City. Morrow was traveling with a French investor, Thierry
Rodzynek, who was held briefly then released.
   Initial reports said that two Americans were taken into custody,
but the State Department confirmed only the arrest of Morrow. Peter
Morrow made no mention of any other American detained with his
brother.
   Official media in Vietnam have made no mention of the detentions.
   According to Peter Morrow, his brother and the Frenchman were in
Vietnam investigating business opportunties in the hotel and
tourist industries.
   The Vietnamese authorities were ``apparently very concerned with
the large amount of business papers that Michael brought along with
him,'' Rodzynek told reporters. It was not known if Morrow had been
accused of wrongdoing.
   A longtime Hong Kong resident, Michael Morrow, 45, is the
publisher of Petroleum News, an industry journal focusing on Asia's
energy sector. He also heads Asia 2000 Ltd., a publishing house,
and a trading company in Hong Kong.
   Michael Morrow has an association with Vietnam dating back to
the Vietnam War, when he began a private news service in the
country. He was captured by Communist forces during the war but was
released after a short captivity.
   ``We urge the Vietnamese to release Michael immediately and
unconditionally,'' said Peter Morrow, a businessman in Hong Kong.
   Both brothers are from Seattle.
   The authorities in Hanoi should also explain the reason for his
brother's detention, and release his brother's notes and accounts,
he said. Peter Morrow said his brother's Vietnamese business
contacts may also have been detained.
   Peter Morrow said Vietnamese authorities told him his brother
was in good health. Rodzynek said that while he was held with
Morrow the two were ``well treated'' by the Vietnamese.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has applied to visit the American,
according to the State Department in Washington.
   But an official there said an advisory against travel to Vietnam
had been in effect since May 1988 ``because we cannot offer
consular services and no third country represents U.S. interests in
Vietnam.''

<HEAD>Poland Dissolves Secret Police; Shipyard Workers Stage Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-feared secret police force was
formally dissolved today as part of a move to place law enforcement
agencies under civilian control, the official PAP news agency said.
   Parliament had voted in April to shake up the Interior Ministry,
which controls the Security Service, the secret police force known
by its Polish initials SB, and the Citizens' Militia, the regular
national police force.
   The announcement comes at a time when many Poles see the changes
in their country lagging behind those in other formerly hard-line
Communist East European nations such as Hungary and East Germany.
   In Gdansk, Lech Walesa criticized the Solidarity-led government
for failing to resolve the status of the Gdansk Shipyard, where the
labor movement was born nearly 10 years ago.
   ``I want you to know that I am ashamed of the present
government, which is our government. I am ashamed because it has
not yet resolved the problem of the shipyard favorably,'' the
Solidarity chairman said in a letter to shipyard workers.
   Walesa released his letter as several hundred workers demanding
pay raises staged a brief work stoppage at the shipyard in the
Baltic port city.
   The workers shut down two departments for several hours to
protest that their average monthly salary of $63 was now less than
the national average of $78 a month.
   The workers suspended their protest pending the results of talks
in Warsaw between Zbigniew Lis, chairman of the Solidarity local in
the shipyard, and Minister of Industry Tadeusz Syryjczyk.
   Some 2,000 of the yard's 7,000 workers held a rally last month
to protest the slow pace of government decisions on the fate of the
state-owned facility, which was slated to be closed as unprofitable
by the previous government.
   The current government has decided that the shipyard will be
sold to shareholders under new regulations that provide for
converting state-owned enterprises into private firms.
   Walesa's comments appeared to be part of a growing offensive to
push for quicker action by the government led by Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and other former top Solidarity activists.
   Walesa has criticized the government for acting too slowly in
implementing reforms and removing Communists from key positions.
   In a brief dispatch, PAP said the government would restore
civilian control over the law enforcement agencies, which in the
past were organized under paramilitary lines to maintain Communist
control of the society.
   The news agency said the Citizens' Militia was to be replaced in
three months by a newly organized police force similar to those in
Western countries. Members of the regular police were eligible to
join the new department.
   Members of the secret police will continue to perform their
duties until a newly created Office of State Protection starts to
operate, also within three months, PAP said.
   The new office is supposed to limit its activities to fighting
espionage and actual threats to national security. Under the former
Communist regime, the secret police harassed and arrested
dissidents, many of whom are now members of the parliament or
government.
   Secret police officers hired before August 1989, when the
Communists held power, must pass a review process to determine
whether they abused their authority before being allowed to join
the new office.
   The Interior Ministry, previously run by uniformed officers
along paramilitary lines, is to become a smaller civilian-run
organization, PAP said.

   A phantom ``Inspector 11'' was part of a scheme
to falsify test reports by the biggest maker of aerospace fasteners
and two managers over 15 years, the government has charged.
   A complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court against VSI

integrity, testing and inspection of bolts and other parts used to
hold engines, wheels and other key aircraft components in place,
assistant U.S. attorney Bruce D. Carter said.
   ``The integrity of these products is often essential to the safe
operation of the aircraft on which they are installed,'' the
complaint said.
   VSI, a Fairchild Industries Inc. subsidiary, is accused of
skimping on tests and inspections, sometimes even delivering
substandard parts to boost profits.
   Carter said an initial hearing before a federal magistrate is
likely Friday.
   Eight previous defendants have pleaded guilty, and the
investigation is continuing, he added.
   The probe against VSI was triggered by a complaint from
whistleblower Tom Runion shortly after he left his job in the
metallurgical laboratory at VSI's Voi-Shan plant in Chatsworth,
Calif., Carter said. Some bolts made at the plant are intended to
bear loads exceeding 200,000 pounds per square inch.
   Inadequate Voi-Shan parts were found during aircraft assembly
and installation and were returned to the manufacturer, but
investigators do not know whether others were not caught in time,
Carter said.
   ``No accidents have been traced to Voi-Shan bolts,'' he said.
   Federal investigators learned that of the government and
civilian buyers of Voi-Shan fasteners, The Boeing Co. and Northrop
Corp. especially had been rejecting substantial deliveries after
making their own tests.
   Boeing said in a news release Wednesday that use of Voi-Shan
materials ``has not compromised the integrity of Boeing products.''
   A key development in the case was a raid on Voi-Shan last year
in which more than 50 boxes of test report packets stamped by a
fictitious ``Inspector 11'' were seized, Carter said.
   James E. Ryan, a former Voi-Shan quality assurance manager, and
Aram Marderian, a former metallurgical laboratory supervisor for
Voi-Shan, also were named as defendants. Each faces a maximum
sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.
   The company and managers are charged with conspiracy to commit
mail fraud, to make false statements to the government and to cheat
the United States.
   The company faces liability for false claims to the government,
plus a maximum fine of twice the gross gain or loss, U.S. Attorney
Mike McKay said.

   An Iranian diplomat said today that all
hostages should be released, including four Iranians missing in
Christian east Beirut.
   Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Jawad Zamanian, who was
recently appointed to the Iranian Embassy in Beirut, talked to
reporters after meeting with various leaders and politicians in the
southern city of Sidon.
   ``As you know, we also were the victims of abduction. We know
that the four Iranian diplomats are alive in east Beirut,'' he
said. ``We express regret for the abductions. Our hostages and all
the hostages should be released.''
   The four Iranian men were seized as they traveled by car across
the Christian enclave north of Beirut in July 1982 during Israel's
invasion of Lebanon. They are thought to have been killed in
shelling or by their captors.
   Iranian officials have repeatedly called for their release, and
President Hashemi Rafsanjani said in October: ``If you say they are
not alive, at least give us their bodies or show us their graves.''
   Iran is believed to have influence over the Shiite Moslem
factions holding most of the 16 Western captives in Lebanon. The
hostages are six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two
Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.
   President Bush has thanked Iran and its Arab ally, Syria, for
helping secure the release of two American hostages, Frank Reed,
57, on April 30, and Robert Polhill, 55, on April 22.
   Bush also has offered to help Iran get information on the
missing Iranians as a ``goodwill gesture,'' but he refused to
negotiate any hostage releases.
   On Tuesday, Hussein Musawi, the reputed mentor of one Shiite
faction, said he feared a Western captive would be killed if it was
confirmed the four Iranians had been slain by their Christian
captors.
   ``If the death of the four Iranians is ascertained, that will
definitely affect the hostage issue. One of the kidnap groups might
react by murdering a hostage,'' Musawi said.
   He said the ``positive indications'' that accompanied the
release of Reed and Polhill ``have diminished.'' Musawi added:
``This issue has turned into a very complicated one because of the
negative U.S. stand ... the hostage issue will be frozen for a
certain period of time.''
   In the past two months, a conflict has emerged in the Iranian
government over the hostage issue.
   Leaders seeking more contact with the West have said 1990 should
be the year of releasing all hostages. But radicals argue that
holding hostages is a means of confronting the West, which the
anti-Western faction considers a cornerstone of the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.

<HEAD>Hard-Core Cocaine Addiction Put at Double Official Estimate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, state figures</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 2.2 million Americans are hard-core
cocaine addicts, more than double the official count of those who
use the drug at least once a week, according to a Senate report
released today.
   ``This news is as alarming as it is tragic,'' Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., said in a statement.
``It suggests that we have a hard-core addict problem that is far
worse than virtually every previous estimate of its scope.''
   Some states have ``extraordinarily high concentrations,'' with
one in every 40 people in New York considered a hard-core user,
according to the Senate Judiciary Committee report.
   The nation's capital has the highest per capita rate, 32.9
weekly users among every 1,000 Washington residents, the report
said.
   The findings, prepared under the supervision of Mark A.R.
Kleiman of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University,
underscored a dispute between Biden and a number of other lawmakers
and the administration over whether to aim the thrust of the drug
war against hard-core or casual users.
   Biden has said hard-core users should be the primary target,
while national drug policy director William Bennett has advocated
efforts directed mainly at stemming casual cocaine use.
   The report expressed doubt about the official findings of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse's household survey, which
estimated the number of Americans who use cocaine at least once a
week at fewer than 900,000.
   ``How could fewer than 900,000 bring such havoc to a nation of
250 million?'' the report asked.
   The Census Bureau estimates the number of Americans at 250
million. The report's count of 2,159,000 million people who use
cocaine once a week would wbe less than 1 percent of the population.
   The committee rounded off its estimate to 2.2 million in the
executive summary of the report and in a statement distributed to
the news media Thursday.
   Drug centers treat about 200,000 hard-core cocaine addicts each
year, according to the report, which added that most who are
arrested are quickly back on the street.
   It estimated there are approximately 55,000 homeless addicts, a
number that ``does not contribute significantly to the national
total'' but that was ``overlooked in the household survey.''
   The report estimated that 1.5 million hard-core cocaine addicts
are arrested annually and represent about 20 percent of all
arrestees nationwide.
   ``This suggests that cocaine is a major cause of crime in the
United States,'' the report said.
   The report estimated that New York had the most hard-core
addicts, with 434,000. After that came California, 325,000; Texas,
144,000; Illinois, 142,000; and Florida, 93,000.
   New York had 24.4 weekly users among every 1,000 residents;
Nevada 22.4; Arizona 12.7; and Illinois 12.2.

   Demonstrators shouting ``No peace for racists''
surrounded, kicked and punched an attorney for a young white man
being tried for murder in the death of a black teen-ager in the
Bensonhurst attack.
   Stephen Murphy, defense lawyer for Keith Mondello, said he was
not seriously hurt during the lunchtime incident Wednesday and he
would not file charges if police identified his assailant.
   Separate juries deciding the fates of Mondello and accused
triggerman Joseph Fama, both 19, did not reach a verdict Wednesday.
They resumed deliberations today in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
   Fama and Mondello, both white 19-year-olds, face 25 years to
life if convicted of murdering Yusuf Hawkins, 16. Hawkins was
fatally shot Aug. 23 in an attack by a white mob when he went to
Bensonhurst with some black friends to see a used car.
   The jury weighing the evidence against Mondello took a second
look Wednesday at his signed, three-page statement taken by police
the day after the shooting. In it, he admits organizing the mob,
carrying a baseball bat and knowing that at least one person had a
gun when Hawkins was shot.
   Murphy says police tricked Mondello into putting his name on the
statement.
   The defense attorney said the 15 to 20 people who surrounded him
on his way to a restaurant Wednesday shouted, ``Yusuf! Yusuf! No
peace for racists!''
   As he neared the restaurant, he said somebody kicked him in the
buttocks.
   ``I felt the kick and, when I turned around, I was punched in
the face,'' Murphy said.
   ``How come they're engaging in the same conduct they're accusing
(the defendants) of?'' said Murphy.
   Plainclothes police officers closed in and escorted Murphy to
lunch and back to the courthouse.
   Murphy has a multiracial clientele; the demonstrators' anger at
him had no apparent basis beyond his involvement in the Bensonhurst
case.

   Radical students and dissidents
ignored a government warning and took to the streets again today to
battle riot police in nationwide demonstrations demanding the
president's resignation.
   Meanwhile, striking shipyard workers in a southeastern
industrial city ended a 13-day holdout atop a giant crane,
apparently because of illness.
   In scattered street protests in Seoul, groups of 200 to 500
students chanted ``Down with President Roh Tae-woo!'' Riot police
moved swiftly to drive protesters off the streets.
   Thousands of riot police were deployed in downtown Seoul. They
tightened street checks and took away pedestrians suspected of
participating in clashes.
   Shortly before nightfall, riot troopers firing volleys of tear
gas, dispersed about 1,500 students carrying firebombs who had
occupied a main street in the capital's downtown.
   News reports said thousands of radical students armed with
rocks, steel pipes and firebombs battled police today outside 40
campuses or in the streets nationwide. But details were not
provided.
   Police did not say how many protesters were arrested today.
Police arrested 1,864 protesters in Wednesday's street protests in
Seoul and 16 other cities, the largest and most violent since Roh
took office in February 1988.
   About 100,000 students and dissidents clashed with riot police
in Wednesday's protests and 150 people, including 100 police, were
injured.
   ``The government will mobilize all available resources to
restore law and order,'' Justice Minister Lee Jong-nam told a
televised news conference today, joined by security-related
ministers.
   ``The government will strictly enforce laws to eradicate crimes
and maintain social stability,'' said Home Minister Ahn Eung-mo,
who controls the nation's 130,000 police.
   But student leaders, reached by telephone, said they would
continue their daily anti-Roh protests. Students have demanded he
annul the recent merger of his governing party with two opposition
groups and speed up reform.
   Wednesday's protests were the largest and most violent since
nationwide anti-government demonstrations forced authoritarian
President Chun Doo-hwan to initiate democratic reforms in 1987 and
step down.
   The 51 shipyard workers in southeastern Ulsan ended their 13-day
holdout on top of a 240-foot crane and were admitted to a hospital
for medical tests. Details were unavilable, but state radio KBS
said the workers were exhausted from a hunger strike begun five
days ago.
   The workers had climbed to the top of the crane on April 28 when
12,000 police raided their shipyard, the world's largest, to end a
strike. They demanded the release of jailed union leaders.
   Officials of the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. in Seoul said they
planned to reopen the shipyard next week.
   In Seoul, thousands of radical students and dissidents rampaged
through downtown streets for more than three hours late Wednesday,
setting fire to a U.S. diplomatic building and firebombing police
offices and vehicles.
   Pitched street battles lasted several hours in the city's
fashionable downtown commercial districts as thousands of students,
hurling rocks and firebombs, clashed with combat-clad riot police
firing tear gas.
   Shouting, ``Yankee go home,'' the students attacked the U.S.
Information Service center in central Seoul with firebombs, setting
off a first-floor fire that raged out of control for two hours.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Suggests Mexican Police Deliver Suspects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today
suggested that Mexican police deliver to American hands more of the
suspects wanted in connection with the 1985 kidnapping and murder
of a U.S. drug agent.
   Thornburgh said U.S. drug agents did nothing wrong last month
when they arrested a Mexican doctor wanted in the case who was
grabbed by Mexican police and whisked across the U.S. border.
   Asked if he would object to a repeat of last month's operation,
the attorney general said: ``Whatever actions that are carried out
by Mexican authorities in Mexico are of no moment to us.''
   ``In fact, the more cooperation we can get the better,'' the
attorney general said.
   Fourteen suspects wanted in connection with the kidnaping or
murder are still at large, mostly in Mexico. They include the
former head of the Mexican federal police and the Mexican office of
Interpol, the international law enforcement agency.
   Mexico has refused to extradite any of the suspects, following a
longstanding practice of not turning over its citizens for
prosecution in this country.
   Thornburgh said he was more concerned about protecting the lives
of American citizens overseas than about any diplomatic protests,
such as the one resulting from last month's arrest of Dr. Humberto
Alvarez Machain.
   The arrest produced a political and diplomatic furor in Mexico,
where authorities accused the U.S. government of violating Mexican
sovereignty. Six suspects in Mexico have been arrested in the
kidnaping case.
   ``I place the integrity and the value of the life of American
citizens No. 1,'' said Thornburgh, who discussed the case last week
with Mexican authorities attending a conference in Santa Fe, N.M.
   ``The misunderstandings that crop up on a day-to-day basis
between neighbors who are dealing with the same problem can be
addressed and dealt with without sacrificing the determination to
enforce the law, particularly in such a heinous crime,'' the
attorney general said during a breakfast interview.
   ``This case has to do with the prosecution of Dr. Alvarez
Machain, an individual who is charged with ... using his medical
skills to keep alive an American citizen who was being tortured so
that he could be tortured some more.''
   Mexico filed a strong protest after Alvarez was arrested by Drug
Enforcement Administration agents in El Paso, Texas, after he
apparently was kidnapped in Guadalajara and flown across the U.S.
border.
   The attorney general noted that American courts have upheld the
arrest of fugitives on U.S. soil even if they were kidnapped
overseas and brought to this country.
   ``So long as there is no conduct outside of this country by
other persons that shocks the conscience of the court, how a person
gets here within our jurisdiction is not a material concern,''
Thornburgh said,
   Thornburgh stressed that no DEA agents were involved in the
operation, which he said was initiated by high-ranking Mexican
police authorities.
   ``In an era of increased cooperation, it's my view that our
people regarded this in good faith as another example of the type
of cooperation that was being extended. And it's not unique,'' the
attorney general said.
   The attorney general said he had no intention ``at this time''
of disciplining any DEA personnel because an internal investigation
by that agency had found no evidence department rules were broken.
   Alvarez, among those charged with the torture and murder of
Enrique Camarena, is now challenging the legality of his arrest in
federal court in Los Angeles.

   ABC soap opera star Susan Lucci, always an Emmy
nominee but never a winner, was nominated Thursday for her 11th
Emmy in as many years as a total of 205 daytime Emmy nominations
were announced here.
   CBS' veteran ``Guiding Light'' and ``The Young and the
Restless'' led the pack with 14 nominations each, followed by 13
for ABC's ``All My Children'' in which Lucci stars and 12 for CBS'
``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
   The nominations for the 17th annual Daytime Emmy Awards even
included two for a rival awards show, NBC's ``The 6th Annual Soap
Opera Awards.''
   CBS shows easily lead the nominations, getting 74, followed by
39 for ABC, 30 for NBC, 29 for PBS, and 29 for syndicated programs.
There only were two cable nominees.
   One was for a Home Box Office special, ``Buy Me That'' which
warned parents and kids of deceptive advertising, and another for
the lighting of an MTV special, ``Club MTV.''
   Winners in the major categories will be announced here on June
28 in a two-hour ABC broadcast hosted by Oprah Winfrey. The show
will be aired live in the East at 3 p.m. EDT, but shown in the West
on a tape-delay basis at 2 p.m. PDT.
   There also will be a non-televised Emmy ceremony in Los Angeles
on June 23, primarily for winners in such creative arts categories
as hair design, makeup, editing, and graphics and title design.
   The nominations in 51 categories were jointly announced by the
Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the
New York-based National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
   In the talk show field, ``The Joan Rivers Show'' and ``The Oprah
Winfrey'' show each got four nominations, followed by three for
Phil Donahue's ``Donahue'' and two for ``Sally Jessy Raphael.'' All
are syndicated series.
   Geraldo Rivera's syndicated ``Geraldo'' wasn't cited, though,
and the only network morning show nominated for Emmy honors was
ABC's top-rated ``Good Morning America,'' which got two nominations.
   CBS' ``The Price Is Right'' led the game show race with six
nominations, followed by the syndicated ``Jeopardy,'' which got
four.
   Although ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' was the most-nominated
children's series, PBS' long-running ``Sesame Street'' got nine
nominations. CBS' ``Jim Henson's Muppet Babies'' and PBS' ```Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood'' and ``Square One TV'' each got four.

   Business and farm leaders joined several
Republican members of Congress today in a plea to President Bush to
keep his campaign promise against raising taxes.
   ``Trying to bring down the deficit by raising taxes is like
giving a drunk another drink to sober him up,'' Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., told a news conference.
   ``My president, who I believed when he said no more taxes ... is
not going to raise taxes,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
   ``The American business community is overwhelmingly against any
tax increase,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
   Grace Rice, speaking for the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said farmers want to reduce the budget deficit through ``a freeze
in total federal spending including agriculture, defense, Social
Security and every other program except for interest on the
national debt.''
   Al Cors of the National Tax Limitation Committee said opposition
to higher taxes is not limited to income-tax rates. ``We consider
`no new taxes' to mean no new income taxes, no new corporate taxes
and no new gas taxes, no new sales taxes ... no new excise taxes
and no new sin taxes.''

   A faulty cooling valve in need of
replacement will delay space shuttle Columbia's launch two to three
weeks while NASA undertakes the first such repairs ever attempted
on the launch pad.
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off May 16 or 17 with seven
astronauts and the $100 million Astro observatory, capable of
probing ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.
   But engineers this week spotted a problem with the valve, which
controls the flow of coolant in the shuttle.
   ``We are obviously disappointed that we are not ready to fly,''
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said
Wednesday. ``However, this particular system is absolutely critical
to the safety of the crew and overall mission success.''
   The shuttle's payload bay doors were opened today and
technicians began the long process of gaining access to the valve
in the shuttle's payload bay.
   The cooling system must be drained of toxic coolant before
workers on platforms can replace the valve assembly, NASA launch
director Bob Sieck said.
   Technicians are to start draining the system late Friday, a
process that involves ``the lion's share of work,'' agency
spokesman Bruce Buckingham said this morning.
   NASA said nets would be placed over Astro, below the valve, so
that its scientific instruments are not damaged.
   Such work has never been performed at the launch pad before. But
returning Columbia to its hangar for repairs would have resulted in
a considerably longer delay.
   ``The only unknown is how long it's going to take because we
don't have any experience base,'' Sieck said.
   A two- to three-week delay is expected to have little impact on
the rest of this year's shuttle schedule, Sieck said.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight will be the 36th shuttle
mission.

   Estonia today proposed establishing a council of
the leaders of the three Baltic republics to coordinate policies as
they seek independence from the Soviet Union, government spokesmen
said.
   The proposal, if accepted by Baltic neighbors Latvia and
Lithuania, would further integrate the republics. All three were
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``So far, it's just an Estonian proposal,'' said Leivi Sher,
spokesman for Estonia's Supreme Soviet, or parliament. The
parliament's Executive Committee approved the measure.
   Also today, the three republics said they signed an agreement
for the direct exchange of agricultural supplies without going
through central Soviet organizations. Most transactions in the
Soviet Union are channeled through central ministries or trade
organizations. The Kremlin imposed a partial economic embargo on
Lithuania after it declared independence.
   Sher said the proposed Council of Baltic States ``would decide
political questions.'' Asked whether the council would constitute a
confederation of the Baltic states, he said: ``It will lead to
their integration.''
   The proposal would revive a council that the three republics
formed in 1934 when they were independent between the world wars,
said Valle Feldman, a spokesman for the Estonian Foreign Ministry.
It would consist of the president, prime minister and foreign
minister of each republic, and could make non-binding
recommendations to the three governments.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev opposes immediate
independence for the Baltic republics and imposed economic
sanctions on Lithuania after it declared independence on March 11.
   It was unclear whether Latvia and Lithuania would agree to the
proposal. Lithuanian spokesmen said no agreement was likely before
the return to Vilnius next week of Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene, in Paris as part of a tour of Western
capitals.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters in Paris that Lithuanian
officials want to negotiate their independence with Moscow
according to a formula proposed by French President Francois
Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. They
suggested that Lithuania temporarily suspend laws implementing the
declaration of independence.
   The agricultural agreement, ``which entered into effect today,
provides that each of the three ministries must have permanent
representatives in the other Baltic republics, who will perform the
functions of coordinators and assistants in joint efforts to
resolve agricultural issues,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   The establishment of direct exchanges of food and other
agricultural supplies and products, and the proposed Council of
Baltic Governments, signal determination by the three republics to
overcome Kremlin opposition to their separatist aspirations.
   All three republics have been seeking independence from the
Soviet Union. Following Lithuania's declaration, Latvia on May 4
declared its independence, saying it would take effect after an
unspecified transition period.
   On Tuesday, Estonia dropped the trappings of Soviet power _
including its flag and name _ invoked sections of the 1938
constitution that declared independence, and proclaimed solidarity
with Latvia and Lithuania.
   Gorbachev has not responded to the Estonian actions and is said
to be studying Latvia's actions.

   John Wesley Fletcher, the last of six
defendants to come to court on federal charges in the PTL scandal,
has pleaded guilty to a single perjury count.
   Fletcher was accused of lying to a grand jury about his bringing
Jessica Hahn to Florida to meet Jim Bakker for the sexual encounter
that led to the downfall of the PTL television ministry.
   Fletcher entered his plea Tuesday in an unpublicized session at
U.S. District Court in Charlotte. U.S. District Judge Robert Potter
accepted the plea but did not set a sentencing date.
   Fletcher, who was a frequent guest on the jailed Bakker's ``PTL
Club'' television show, was indicted in December.
   According to the indictment, Fletcher denied during a September
1987 appearance before the grand jury that he brought Miss Hahn to
a hotel to have sex with Bakker. Testifying later, he admitted sex
was the purpose of the meeting, according to the indictment.
   Fletcher, 50, is free on $25,000 unsecured bond. Late last
month, he was released from the Butner Federal Correctional
Institution, where he underwent a lengthy psychiatric evaluation.
   In his order releasing Fletcher, U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor
said Butner official Deborah Poe informed him that the evaluation
was completed.
   ``Ms. Poe had advised that there is nothing in the report of Mr.
Fletcher's evaluation indicating that he would be a danger to
himself or the community,'' Taylor wrote in his April 25 order.
   Fletcher is believed to be living in the Durham area.
   Under the plea agreement, Potter said he could sentence Fletcher
to a reduced term of eight to 14 months in prison. Fletcher had
faced five years and a $250,000 fine.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year prison sentence in Minnesota. He was
convicted of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy in October; he is
appealing the conviction.
   Former PTL executive vice president Richard Dortch is serving a
30-month sentence on related charges; former Bakker aides David and
James Taggart are serving long terms for federal income tax
evasion. Perjury charges against former PTL pastor Sam Johnson were
dropped.

<HEAD>FCC Gives New York Company Permission to Operate Pocket-Sized
Telephone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission said
today it has given a New York company permission to operate a new
type of pocket-sized telephone in Houston and Orlando, Fla., that
proponents claim could replace traditional wire or cellular phone
service.
   The new system, known as personal communications networks, will
be built by PCN American Inc. Millicom. It will use high-frequency
microwave signals to connect telephones over short distances, such
as in office buildings or neighborhoods.
   Like existing cellular telephones, the new service will be able
to ``pass off'' phone calls as users move from one transmitter area
to another. And because the range of the devices _ as little as 600
feet _ is short compared with cellular phones, many more
conversations can be crammed onto existing microwave channels
without causing interference.
   This large-capacity feature is expected to make the devices
popular and drive down their costs. Officials at American Personal
Communications Inc., which earlier this year received FCC
permission to test the new type of phones in the Washington area,
told The Washington Post they hoped the phones ultimately would
cost $50 to $75.
   ``I fundamentally believe that PCNs are going to be the first
serious means of competition for local communications,'' an AT&amp;T
official, Richard B. Snyder, was quoted as saying in today's New
York Times.
   Millicom told the newspaper it would spend $20 million to build
a 25,000-subscriber system in Houston and a 20,000-subscriber
system in Orlando.. Both systems are expected to begin operating in
two years.
   Cellular phones use a few large radio towers to transmit calls
across what are known as ``cells.'' The equipment automatically
passes off calls as a caller in an automobile, for instance, passes
from cell to cell.
   The new PCN system will rely on refrigerator-sized, low-power
transmitters that will transmit across a more limited area.
   Millicom told the Times it would transmit calls from one
transmitter to the next, rather than connecting with the local
telephone system.
   At least one regional Bell company, BellSouth, is interested in
the new technology and plans to apply for permit to develop it if
the Millicom experiment succeeds and regional or municipal licenses
are issued, the Times said.
   The British government already has selected three consortiums to
build nationwide PCN systems in Britain. One company, Cable and
Wireless PLC, has predicted the costs for the service will be only
slightly more than for today's wired phone calls.

   The Army Corps of Engineers will take steps to lower river
levels in flood-battered southwestern Arkansas, an aide to Gov.
Bill Clinton said today. In the central part of the state, water
levels were slowly receding after cresting at the highest point in
47 years.
   ``We've been notified by the corps that they are going to try to
reduce the flow,'' said Mike Gauldin, Clinton's press secretary.
   ``They are making a complete new assessment,'' Gauldin said.
``They're sending people down to southwest Arkansas today and
they're going to reduce the flow over the next day or so.''
   Heavy rain and flooding along the Trinity, Arkansas and Red
rivers in the past two weeks have claimed 13 lives, one in Oklahoma
and the rest in Texas. As the bulge of water has moved downstream
to the east and south, the worst of the flooding has shifted from
north-central Texas and Oklahoma to Arkansas and northeastern
Texas. Flooding was also affecting parts of northern Louisiana.
   Thousands of cattle were stranded and crops flooded out in
Arkansas, and some homeowners shot at joy-riding boaters roiling
the water.
   At a meeting with angry farmers in Ashdown, Ark., on Wednesday,
Clinton said a task force should look at corps management of the
Red River in the state's southwest border. Some farmers also
criticized the corps activities on the Arkansas River, which runs
diagonally through the state from northwest to southeast.
   Decisions made by the Corps of Engineers on how fast to release
water from the reservoirs it manages can have a crucial effect on
who is flooded, and how severely. A quick release of water after a
heavy rain increases flooding downstream, while slower release can
mean more flooding upstream.
   Appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' Wednesday with Brig. Gen.
Robert C. Lee, the regional corps commander, Clinton said
southwestern Arkansas residents ``feel that maybe the corps could
be holding some more water back. The levees have broken there in
places, in other places, there's no opportunity even to put the
sandbags up.''
   If it proves impossible to hold some of the water at dams
upstream, he said, ``we're going to lose several thousand head of
cattle and maybe the opportunity to plant rice and soybeans in this
season.''
   Red River valley farmers said the corps should have released
more water from reservoirs during the winter.
   ``They hold the water when the water should be let out, and when
they need to be able to hold the water in the spring when we have
these big rains, they're turning it out,'' said Paul Hawkins, whose
3,000 acres were under water.
   The area's wheat was three weeks from harvest, farmers said.
   Lee defended the Engineers' procedures. If not for the corps'
efforts, he said, ``the water would be eight feet deeper now than
it is.''
   Diana Hinton, a trailer park owner, said Red River levees had
been neglected and were unable to hold back floodwaters.
   ``Why aren't these levees being upkept?'' she asked. ``I just
lost a trailer park, and these people are losing their land and
their cattle.''
   About 15,000 head of cattle were stranded in flood waters with
no way to get them to higher ground or to feed them, said Judge
Clyde Wright, administrator of Little River County.
   On the Texas side of the Red River, the state was using a
helicopter to feed about 1,000 stranded cattle. The corps brought
30,000 sandbags to shore up levees along the Texas side of the
river on Wednesday, where about 200 people have been evacuated from
rural areas north of Texarkana. Water earlier broke through the top
of a 60-foot-long levee section.
   Jane Mueller, dispatcher for the Texarkana Office of Emergency
Services, said officials believe the Red River crested at 32.13
feet at 1 a.m. today. By 6 a.m., the water level had dropped to
32.06 feet, seven feet above flood stage.
   In Arkansas, Joe Brady of the Office of Emergency Services said
damage to the state's roads and bridges was at least $10 million.
Officials said they hadn't yet calculated damage to agriculture and
other property.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to set up 200
telephone lines to take calls from those seeking disaster aid.
   In Pine Bluff, floodwaters crested Wednesday morning at 47.5
feet, the highest level since 1943, when they reached 52.1 feet.
The water dropped to just under 47 feet by this morning, but about
300 homes remained flooded, officials said.
   Some bitter homeowners fired shots at anglers taking advantage
of the flood to fish for bass, crappie and catfish drawn to insects
flushed out by the rising water, said Boe Fontaine, a sheriff's
lieutenant outside Pine Bluff.
   ``These boats go by and make a wake, and it wakes into the
house,'' Fontaine said. ``People are hot enough right now that they
get around too close and somebody's liable to take a shot at them,
and it happened today.''
   Health officials warned that mosquitoes carrying the
encephalitis virus were hatching in swamped Dallas neighborhoods,
which are starting to dry out after the Trinity River crested there
last week.
   Some residents of Dallas' Rochester Park neighborhood returned
home. Hundreds of houses in the poor neighborhood were inundated by
the worst flooding in more than 70 years.
   City officials promised to build a new levee by 1993 to shelter
the area, but William Andrews, pastor of the Independent Missionary
Baptist Church, said he can't understand why the levee hasn't been
built before now.
   ``It's been dirty year after year. I don't know what they're
waiting on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ground Victims of Pan Am Lockerbie Crash Reach Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ground victims of the terrorist bombing of Pan Am's
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, have reached a settlement with
the airline, an attorney for the victims said today.
   All 259 passengers and crew aboard the plane were killed when
the jet plowed into the quiet Scottish town Dec. 21, 1988. Eleven
people on the ground were killed, a dozen others were injured and
many homes were damaged or destroyed.
   About 250 Lockerbie familes filed claims in Dade Circuit Court
because two Pan Am subsidiaries have headquarters here, said Miami
attorney Aaron Podhurst.
   ``It was negotiated over a period of time, and it just
culminated this week,'' said Podhurst, who represents the Lockerbie
Air Disaster Committee. Under the agreement he was prevented from
releasing any details, he said.
   New York-based Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kreindler acknowledged a
settlement but also said he could not discuss its terms.
   The agreement doesn't affect lawsuits filed by the families of
those aboard the plane, Podhurst said. Some of those suits also
were filed in Miami, but the majority are in federal court in New
York.
   The passenger claims are covered by international agreements and
are limited to $75,000 unless victims can prove gross negligence.
Pan Am agreed that the Lockerbie ground victims were covered by
Scottish law, which Podhurst said had no limit.
   A Scottish investigation into the crash is to be completed in
September and probably will be the basis for settling the passenger
claims, Podhurst said.
   Flight 103 was flying from London to New York when a bomb went
off in the luggage hold.
   Investigations indicated a bomb may have been placed inside a
radio in baggage put aboard the flight in Frankfurt, West Germany.
The luggage was transferred to the Pan Am Boeing 747 in London, and
it exploded over Lockerbie shortly after takeoff.
   U.S. authorities acknowledged they had received an alert about a
possible attack on a Pan Am airliner and had even warned diplomatic
personnel to avoid using the carrier.
   The Lockerbie suits charged Pan Am ``had actual and constructive
knowledge'' that Flight 103 ``was subject to a specific and known
danger of terrorist or other criminal or wrongful activities.''
   Pan Am's Miami subsidiaries, Pan Am World Services and Alert
Management Systems, were accused of failing to provide adequate
security for the flight.

   A government stamp of approval is no guarantee
a product is safe, so manufacturers should not be exempt from
punishment when an approved product causes death or injury,
consumer advocates said today.
   Four national consumer groups reported that more than 1,300
deaths and thousands of serious injuries in the last 10 years
resulted from the use of drugs and medical devices approved by the
Food and Drug Administration.
   The report was issued as the Senate Commerce consumer
subcommittee held its third hearing on federal product liability
legislation backed by the Bush administration.
   The legislation includes a provision to exempt from punitive
damages in product liability cases those manufacturers whose
products received premarket approval from the FDA or the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   ``There is no principled basis, nor is there a need, to shield
manufacturers from punitive damages just because they have complied
with government standards,'' the report said.
   However, drug manufacturers argued today that under the proposed
legislation, injured victims would be protected and research and
marketing of potentially life-saving drugs would be speeded.
   ``This defense would not prevent full compensation from being
awarded to injured persons,'' said Richard Kingham, an attorney
representing the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
   ``There is documented evidence that liability concerns ... about
punitive damages have caused manufacturers to withdraw beneficial
drugs from the market,'' Kingham said.
   ``This is a disincentive to safety,'' he added.
   The study was issued jointly by Consumers Union, Public Citizen,
U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Consumer Federation of
America. It cited several cases in which FDA-approved drugs and
devices caused deaths or life-threatening and permanent injuries.
   ``It is documentation of the failures of the FDA,'' said Pam
Gilbert, legislative director for Public Citizen's Congress Watch.
   The report said regulatory delays are one reason agency approval
should not be used as an excuse for corporate liability.
   It said that although strong evidence linked Reye's Syndrome, a
rare and often fatal disease, to the use of aspirin to treat
chicken pox and flu in children, it was four years before the
government required warning labels.
   ``In those four years, approximately 3,000 children developed
Reye's Syndrome, about 1,000 children died and many of the
surviving children suffered brain damage,'' the report said.
   The consumer groups also cited the FDA's approval of the
sedative Versed, used in short diagnostic surgical procedures, as a
sign that flaws in the regulatory process make the agency
unreliable.
   ``Several serious flaws in the approval process and subsequent
monitoring of Versed resulted in 40 deaths from cardiac or
respiratory depression in patients using the drug in the United
States,'' the report said.
   Business and industry representatives argue the liability
exception should be included in the bill because regulatory
agencies have more expertise than the courts to set and measure
product standards.
   ``Allowing the courts to second-guess regulatory standards may
result in unjustified imposition of liability,'' Robert C. Holland,
president of the Committee on Economic Development, told an earlier
hearing by the subcommittee.
   The CED is a research organization representing top business
executives and presidents of several major universities.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of East German workers put
down their tools, closed classrooms and blocked borders Thursday to
demand protection from the high unemployment that is expected to be
the price of German unification.
   The protests by teachers, textile workers and farmers were
called by unions and lasted only a few hours. They were timed to
coincide with a Parliament discusstion
with West Germany.
   ``We want to prevent the initiation of the monetary union from
causing the social deterioration of our work force,'' Sigrid
Jauernig, head of the textile workers union, told the government
news agency ADN.
   The protests were the latest and largest demonstrations of
anxiety by a work force worried about what will happen July 2, when
the Germanys are to merge their economies and social institutions.
   After the protests, Parliament Secretary Guenther Krause said
discussions would begin next week with the 600,000-member
farmworkers union and eventually all labor organizations, ADN said.
   The Germanys have been negotiating on the draft of a state
treaty under which East Germany's economy and social structure
would be absorbed by the West in six weeks.
   Economists predict many inefficient East German factories will
close in the next year because they will not be able to compete in
the free market, and that between 500,000 and 2 million East German
workers will lose their jobs.
   Both West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere say a quick influx of Western
investment will create new jobs and raise East German living
standards.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats, the junior partner in de
Maiziere's governing coalition, are pressing de Maiziere to push
for more social guarantees for East Germans dependent on heavy
subsidies under the old socialist system.
   Joblessness already has begun rising. On Wednesday, the
government said the number of people who registered for
unemployment rose from 38,313 in March to 64,948 last month.
   The head of East Germany's Association for the Unemployed, Klaus
Grehn, criticized the government's official jobless figure, saying
the ``real amount'' is ``significantly higher.''
   Grehn predicted that 600,000 workers will lose their jobs this
summer, with the biggest losses likely to come in the contruction
and textile industries.
   In Bonn, West Germany, Kohl said Thursday that East Germany must
restructure its beleaguered economy before the two nations share
the same West German currency.
   Kohl also renewed his demand that East Germany be prepared to
start dismantling its 41-year-old system of state ownership if
economic union with West Germany is going to be a success.
   ``Enormous efforts stand before us,'' he said.
   Thousands of teachers held two- to four-hour warning strikes
Thursday morning in East Berlin, Frankfurt an der Oder, Magdeburg,
Neubrandenburg, Hohenschoenhausen, Rostock, and several other
cities, ADN said.
   About 2,000 kindergarten, primary school and college teachers
marched through East Berlin to the Parliament building. They
demanded job and benefits security.
   Highways linking major East and West German cities were blocked
by convoys of dilapidated tractors and farm trucks for 10 minutes
to an hour. The blockade was the third in the past two weeks.
   The farmworkers are fearful of job losses from Western
competition and the transition of state-owned land to the private
sector.
   Thousands of leather and textile workers in Leipzig, Dresden,
Chemnitz, Cottbus, Erfurt and other industrial cities shut off
their machines for an hour to call attention to their fear of
Western imports, ADN said.
   Several thousand shoe and textile workers rallied in East
Berlin's main square, Alexanderplatz.
   East Germans have been buying better-made Western imports since
the borders between the nations were opened in November, after the
Communist regime was ousted.

   The worst spring snowstorm on record blanketed
much of Wisconsin today, creating hazardous conditions for stunned
motorists, closing schools, and downing power wires and trees.
   The storm, packing heavy snow, gusty winds and sleet, came two
days after temperatures peaked in the high 70s throughout much of
the state. It caught most municipal officials by surprise; most
winter road equipment had been placed in storage.
   The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for
eastern Wisconsin, forecasting snow totals as high as 8 inches in
areas north and west of Milwaukee.
   ``Until the weather lets up and the winds die down, it's not
safe to be outdoors,'' said Hartford Mayor Dean Kirley, who
declared a state of emergency in his city of 7,000 located 30 miles
northwest of Milwaukee.
   Kirley said Hartford had about 6 to 8 inches on the ground by
midmorning.
   ``We've felt the brunt of it. I've asked the citizens to stay
off the streets and sidewalks,'' he said, noting that downed wires
and icy roads made conditions hazardous.
   The storm, spun off from a massive low pressure system centered
over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, began Wednesday with soaking
rains. Many areas of Wisconsin reported more than 2 inches of rain
by midnight.
   The storm's approach dropped temperatures in Milwaukee from the
mid-60s Wednesday to 33 degrees at 9 a.m. today, creating a mixture
of heavy snow, sleet and some rain. The wet snow weighed down tree
branches covered with leaves, increasing the damage to trees and
power lines.
   Weather Service specialist Edmond Lowe said the accumulation was
not the latest snowfall ever recorded in Wisconsin but did set a
record for the heaviest spring snow accumulation.
   To the south, in Illinois, the storm system brought up to 4
inches of rain in the Chicago suburbs and snow flurries and sleet
at O'Hare International Airport.

   Suspected Kurdish guerrillas attacked a

and killing three people, the Anatolia News Agency reported
Thursday.
   The dispatch said the attack occured Wednesday night. Five
guerrillas built a barricade on the railway to halt the train. They
forced the driver and two other workers out of the train and shot
them, then fled after setting the train on fire, Anatolia said.
   Kurdish guerrillas have killed 14 people in attacks in
southeastern Turkey over the past week.
   The guerrillas belong to the Kurdish Labor Party, a Marxist
group fighting since 1984 to establish an independent nation in
Turkey's southeastern provinces.

   A coal mine fire caused dozens of deaths in
northeastern China this week, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Thursday.
   The brief report gave no specific casualty figure and did not
say if the fire, which broke out Tuesday morning, had been
extinguished.
   It said the cause was still under investigation.
   The fire occurred at the Xiaohengshan Colliery in Heilongjiang
province in China's northeast. The exact location of the mine was
not given.
   It was the second serious mine accident in Heilongjiang in a
month. Thirty people were killed and 11 injured April 15 when an
explosion occurred in the Taoshan Colliery.
   Most Chinese coal mines lack modern equipment and safety
provisions. Official figures indicated that about 1,780 miners were
killed in accidents in 1989.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday
warned that East Germany must restructure its beleaguered economy
if it wants to get the powerful West German mark.
   In a three-hour parliamentary debate, Kohl also reiterated that
he wants the question of a united Germany's military attachments
cleared up before the two nations actually merge.
   Kohl pressed East Germany for greater flexibility in bargaining
over the merger of their economies, planned by July 2. Parliament
was debating problems facing the unity process.
   He said there must be an overall agreement on restructuring the
East German economy before East Germany can replace its weak
currency with the West German mark.
   ``It is for me self-evident that the currency conversion stands
in indissoluble connection with total agreement'' on economic
union, Kohl said.
   The two German nations have reached basic agreement on terms for
replacing East Germany's currency with the deutsche mark but are
divided on some key elements of overall economic union.
   Kohl renewed his demand that East Germany be prepared to start
dismantling its 41-year-old system of state ownership if economic
union with West Germany is going to be a success.
   ``Enormous efforts stand before us,'' Kohl said.
   ``Of course this concerns foremostly the budget of East Germany,
which ... can and must put to use the so-called peoples-owned
property,'' he added.
   West German officials have said private ownership of property
and industry is crucial to creating a market economy that could
spawn jobs and incomes in East Germany.
   Kohl reiterated his discomfort over a Soviet suggestion that
German unity could come before all the international military
complexities are worked out. The Soviet Union opposes NATO
membership for a united Germany, but Bonn and its NATO allies say
Germany's membership in the western alliance is crucial.
   West Germany wants ``both processes to proceed ... in unison
with each other, and in close consultation with our partners and
allies,'' Kohl said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze suggested last
week the external aspects of unification _ such as a united
Germany's military attachments _ would not have to be settled
before the merger actually occurred.
   He proposed that the four World War II victors _ the Soviet
Union, the United States, Britain and France _ retain some of their
special postwar rights for a transition period after unity.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who initially greeted
Shevardnadze's idea as a means of speeding up the unification
process, changed his tone during Thursday's debate.
   ``The German people are entitled to German unity, and are also
entitled to having the external aspects of unity cleared up without
delay,'' Genscher said.
   Genscher said an ``understanding'' should be reached over the
``external aspects of German unification'' before this fall. But he
did not say when he thought all the special rights of the four
World War II allies should be actually stripped away.
   Genscher also said the West must ensure the Soviet Union is
allowed to play ``an important and constructive role in Europe's
future. Europe does not end at the Polish border.''

   The executive director of the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra who helped stabilize its bleak finances has resigned to
become president of the Minnesota Orchestral Association.
   Deborah Borda, 40, who joined the Detroit Symphony in January
1989 when it was struggling with a $10-million deficit, said
Wednesday she will leave Aug. 1.
   ``This is a challenge I am eager to undertake, but I am also
very proud of what I have done in Detroit,'' she said.
   Borda and orchestra Chairman Robert Miller are credited with
helping to raise $8 million from corporations in emergency funds,
winning wage concessions from the musicians, moving the DSO to
Orchestra Hall and hiring Conductor Neeme Jarvi.
   Also, ticket sales increased by 45 percent since the two arrived
in Detroit about the same time.
   Jarvi said he was shocked by Borda's resignation.
   ``It's bad, very bad news,'' Jarvi said. ``Now we have to find a
person to start from zero to continue that which she has started.''
   But Miller said the resignation will not hamper plans to improve
finances.

   The White House today disavowed comments by a
senior administration official ruling out tax hikes at the upcoming
budget summit and said President Bush assured congressional leaders
nothing was off the bargaining table.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the remarks, widely
understood to be by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, did not
reflect Bush's position and that the official did not speak for the
president.
   The official was quoted as saying that the White House would say
``no'' to any tax increases proposed by Democrats at the upcoming
budget summit.
   ``That's crazy,'' declared Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Bush called House Speaker Thomas S. Foley this
morning to assure him he had not changed his position.
   Meanwhile, Bush came under fire from congressional Democrats for
failing to make his position clear on the issue of higher taxes.
   ``It is time for the president to speak,'' said Rep. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. ``What is it that he would bring forward? The
president waits, but the nation deserves to hear.''
   Although administration aides have asserted that negotiations to
get under way next Tuesday would have ``no preconditions,'' Bush
himself has not yet spoken out on whether he will accept a tax
increase as part of a deficit-cutting package.
   Democratic skepticism toward the summit appeared to grow today
after a ``senior administration official'' was quoted in today's
editions of The Washington Post and The Washington Times as
suggesting the White House would reject any attempt by Democrats to
propose a tax increase.
   The official was identified as speaking on a plane from Costa
Rica to Washington with Barbara Bush and White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu. The official was further described as ``the main White
House link to conservatives.''
   Sununu, who is generally viewed as conservatives' main pipeline
into the White House, was the only senior White House official on
Mrs. Bush's plane.
   Other passengers on the plane said that Sununu was the speaker.
   The official was quoted as saying: ``We're allowing them
(Democrats) to bring their good arguments for taxes to the table.
... They were not persuasive last time and are likely not to be
persuasive again.''
   ``But if they want to come to the table and say they put (tax
increases) there, it is their prerogative to put them on the table,
and it's our prerogative to say no. And I emphasize the no.''
   The comments appeared to contradict earlier White House
assertions that nothing was off the table on budget talks,
including taxes.
   Fitzwater, while not willing to state publicly that the speaker
was Sununu, said that the official was not speaking for the
president.
   ``I speak for the president. It's as simple as that,'' he
declared.
   The spokesman said he had spoken to Bush directly today and was
told by the president that ``his position is no preconditions.''
   As to the fact that Sununu is one of the White House negotiators
in the budget talks, Fitzwater said: ``The president is the chief
negotiator. He will be responsible for all the negotiations.
Period.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that whether the remarks on
the plane were by ``John Sununu or someone else, we have a message
to the whole White House ... Don't worry _ Democrats will not put
taxes on the table.''
   ``After all, it was the White House that called the summit, the
president that called the summit. It's up to the president to tell
us, one, what the crisis is and number two, what he intends to do
about it,'' Schumer added.
   Torricelli said: ``We have heard from his press spokesman, we
have heard from his political aides, we have heard from his
consultants, but the American people have not heard from the
president of the United States.''
   Many Democrats have voiced suspicion that Bush's call for a
budget summit was a trap to draw them into supporting an
election-year tax hike.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., while saying he won't
question Bush's motives, put a top critic of Bush's tax policies in
charge of their negotiating team seeking a deficit-reduction pact
with the White House.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., will serve as
chairman of the talks and will preside except when Bush himself is
in the room, Foley said Wednesday.
   White House officials say that _ without action _ the federal
deficit could be up to $100 billion higher than the $64 billion
shortfall allowed by law.
   The president has proposed a $1.23 trillion budget for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Failure to cut the deficit could force huge domestic and
military spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law
that neither party wants, and the Democrats quickly agreed to the
talks. But there is no clear path to agreement on spending
restraint and new revenue sources to avert the cuts.

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police launched an
early morning raid today on the Canadian side of this troubled
reservation, arresting 21 people on weapons and drug charges and
confiscating about $1 million in drugs.
   The raid by 100 officers from three Canadian police forces
culminated a 14-month investigation; hundreds of police officers
stationed on the reservation because of recent violence helped in
making the arrests, according to Peter West, a spokesman for the
Ontario Provincial Police.
   Police had planned to make the raid earlier, but were ``delayed
by the unrest on the reserve,'' West said.
   Police also raided homes in the city of Cornwall, just outside
the Ontario portion of the reservation, West said. The reservation
is also split between Quebec province and New York state.
   The drug raid is the latest police action on this reservation
that has been occupied by a force of several hundred police from
Canada and the U.S. Police sealed off the reservation to outsiders
after a Mohawk gambling war claimed two lives on May 1.
   The three chiefs governing the U.S. side of the St. Regis Indian
Reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canadian border, sent a
letter Wednesday asking Cuomo to help set up a tribal police squad.
   Cuomo last week proposed the creation of a Mohawk police force
for the 28,000-acre reservation, where two Indians were shot to
death May 1.
   ``We welcome your positive approach and appreciate your offer of
assistance as we attempt to bring order back into the daily lives
of our Mohawk people,'' read the letter from chiefs Harold Tarbell,
L. David Jacobs and Lincoln White.
   Cuomo's response to 10 months of sporadic violence involving
opponents and backers of gambling on the reservation drew fire
Wednesday from a member of another Iroquois tribe who quit the
governor's Humanities Council.
   ``You are, in effect, urging the Mohawks to give up their
sovereignty,'' Onondaga Indian Nancy Johnson said in her
resignation letter to Cuomo. ``Such unrealistic paternal advice
will only further escalate violence.''
   Cuomo appointed Johnson to the panel in 1986.
   The letter asking Cuomo to maintain a state police presence in
what many Mohawks consider an independent territory was an unusual
sign of harmony among the three chiefs. Jacobs and White support
reservation gambling as an economic boon, while head chief Tarbell
says the casinos are destroying the Mohawk way of life.
   Tarbell is up for election June 2 for a second three-year term.
Pro-gambling Mohawks hope to unite on a candidate to oppose him,
said Melvin White, who is a nephew of Lincoln White and who
organized a meeting for that purpose Wednesday.

<HEAD>Pro-Abortion Patrick Kennedy Disinvited From Speech at Catholic
School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence
ordered a church high school to cancel a speech by state Rep.
Patrick Kennedy because the Democrat supports a woman's right to
seek an abortion.
   The 22-year-old son of Sen. Edward Kennedy said he had no
intention of discussing abortion during his talk, but diocesan
officials told officials at Prout Memorial High School in South
Kingston to find another speaker for last Sunday's mother-daughter
breakfast.
   ``I felt it would be inappropriate that he speak,'' Brother
Daniel F. Casey, diocesan school superintendent, said. ``His
position runs opposite to what the school is teaching.''
   Casey was quoted in Thursday's editions of The Providence
Journal-Bulletin.
   A parent who helped organize the breakfast said Kennedy was
invited to speak because ``he's young, he's aggressive and he's a
Kennedy,'' not because of his stance on abortion.
   ``He just seemed to be a great choice,'' said Edward H. Torgen,
an attorney whose wife, Mary Ann, headed the committee that
organized the event.
   Kennedy, who is Catholic, said he was angry. ``I understand that
the church is being very careful about who is invited to speak at
these things. But I think the manner in which it was handled
obviously was disturbing. I don't think anybody likes being
disinvited.''
   Kennedy said he had intended to use his speech to encourage
students to ``become active in their communities and make a
difference.''
   Casey said he learned that Kennedy was to speak through a
newspaper notice. He checked and found out that Kennedy supported
abortion rights, then told Prout administrators to withdraw the
invitation. However, word did not reach Kennedy's office until
Friday, two days before the breakfast.
   Deborah Thompson, co-founder of Dorcas Place, a Providence
school that helps the illiterate, spoke in Kennedy's place. Torgen
said few of the 120 people who attended the breakfast complained
about Kennedy's absence.
   The flap came almost a year after Kennedy's father had a similar
experience in Rhode Island.
   The St. Vincent de Paul Society, a Catholic organization,
canceled the Massachusetts senator's appearance at its annual
meeting in Providence when abortion opponents threatened to picket.

   The House voted today to guarantee workers up
to three months of unpaid leave in family emergencies, ignoring a
White House threat to veto the bill.
   The House voted 237-187 to approve the bill after turning back
opponents' efforts to send it back to committee. The bill now goes
to the Senate.
   The bill requires business and government employers to provide
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or for the care
of a new or ill child, parent or spouse. It exempts small
businesses with fewer than 50 workers, and drops earlier language
setting various periods of leave for workers with different
emergencies.
   The vote, while a victory for supporters, was short of what
would be needed to override a presidential veto. Though the bill
had bipartisan support and the backing of the House Democratic
leadership, more than 50 Democrats voted against it.
   Approval came as opponents withdrew a series of amendments, and
after a 259-167 vote to adopt a substitute measure sponsors said
was a compromise aimed at drawing more support to the measure.
   The bill, strongly opposed by the Bush administration, faces an
uncertain future in the Senate. The Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee approved a similar measure more than a year
ago, but sponsors have not yet scheduled floor action and none is
expected before Memorial Day.
   Supporters of the measure pointed to President Bush's own
campaign rhetoric. Opponents charged the measure would be costly
and burdensome for small businesses.
   Rep. Bill Green of New York, a liberal Republican who supports
the measure, quoted from remarks Bush made as a presidential
candidate and said he seemed to be supporting just such a measure
then.
   Green said Bush told a Republican women's group in September
1988: ``We need to assure that women don't have to worry about
getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a child
during a serious illness. That is what I mean when I talk about a
gentler nation.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that the
president wants employers to offer guaranteed job-protected leave
but opposes any bill requiring periods of leave.
   ``Let me note he used the word `assure','' Green said, referring
to Bush's campaign speech. ``He didn't say we should urge employers
to do it.'' Green said the only to assure such leaves is by
legislation.
   One opponent, Rep. Barbara Vucanovich, R-Nev., charged today
that the bill ``would erode the very basis of democracy'' by
ordering businesses to offer a particular benefit. She said it
would actually hurt women by encouraging employers not to hire or
promote them.
   ``This is a wolf in sheep's clothing'' she said. ``Many have
attempted to mislead Congress by calling it a pro-family, pro-woman
bill. It is anything but that.''
   Rep. James Quillen, R-Tenn., said it would reduce employers'
flexibility in offering benefits to employees and ``do serious
damage to many small businesses.''
   Several supporters argued that most Western nations already
require time off for workers with new children or other family
needs, and many provide for leave with full or partial pay. The
increasing role of women in the workforce makes such protections
important for families, they said.
   The bill is the second dealing with family concerns that the
White House has threatened to veto this year, and Democrats hoped
to contrast that record in an election year with Bush's public
support for family values.
   A conference committee has been named to work out House and
Senate differences on a broader bill designed to help families find
and afford child care, which also is under a veto threat.
   Under the family leave bill, employers would have to continue
health insurance benefits for those on leave and restore a
returning employee to his or her previous job or an equivalent
position.
   Women's groups supporting the bill contend that workers,
particularly women, suffer substantial earnings losses after the
birth of a child or during illnesses because many can't return to
their jobs at the same pay.
   Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, oppose
the bill, saying it would be costly to employers and hurt
productivity. Although the measure requires employers to offer only
unpaid leave, some opponents were concerned it could lead to later
legislation requiring paid leave or other benefits.

   The leader of 95 anti-abortion protesters
who spent up to 11 weeks behind bars for refusing to identify
themselves after their arrest vowed more protests today upon the
group's release from jail.
   The protesters finally agreed to give their names Wednesday and
were promptly freed. Under an agreement with the state, they were
found guilty of trespassing and sentenced to the amount of time
they had already served.
   ``They wanted to break us,'' said the Rev. Michael McHugh,
leader of the local anti-abortion movement. ``They didn't do it.''
   Fifty to 60 protesters knelt in prayer and sang hymns this
morning on the sidewalk in front of the Planned Parenthood office
in Burlington. Other protests were scheduled for later today,
McHugh said.
   ``If they come on our property, we'll take legal action against
them,'' Rachel Atkins, spokeswoman for the Vermont Women's Health
Center in Burlington, said today.
   The 95 demonstrators were arrested in a series of sit-ins at two
Burlington clinics from Feb. 21 to April 17. Most were charged with
unlawful trespass, punishable by up to 90 days in jail.
   District Judge Matthew Katz jailed them without bail because
they insisted on giving their names as ``Baby Jane Doe'' and ``Baby
John Doe'' to represent the fetuses not allowed to come to term.
Katz ruled those ``monikers'' did not constitute identification.
   The demonstrators had been jailed for up to 78 days, about a
week more than they probably would have been held if they they been
tried and convicted.
   The standoff ended with an agreement between Edward Sutton,
deputy state's attorney, and Daniel Lynch, a lawyer for the
protesters.
   The protesters gave their names, addresses and birth dates and
let themselves be fingerprinted and photographed, then signed a
statement agreeing to the basic facts of their cases, Sutton said.
   ``We're very happy to be out in our freedom,'' said Joan
Andrews, a national leader of the anti-abortion movement who was
jailed 78 days. ``Maybe in the next weeks some children will be
saved because of us.''
   Lynch said the protesters accepted the deal because the state
did not assess fines or probation as conditions of release, did not
force the protesters to plead guilty and released them all at once.
   Eight of the 95 protesters were from Vermont; the rest were from
all over the country.
   ``It's a tremendous victory,'' Lynch said. ``Mission
accomplished.''

   Madonna Mae Morgan didn't make much of an
impact on this small northwest Kansas town during her life, but she
has been the main topic of discussion since her death in March.
   Mrs. Morgan's will left the city an estimated $1 million. But
the gift came with strings attached _ the town of about 2,300 must
raise a matching amount within two years and use the money to build
a community center.
   Mrs. Morgan, 88, was not well-known in the town, and the bequest
caught nearly everyone by surprise.
   ``We were absolutely stunned at first,'' said City Administrator
Jerry Fear. ``But everybody decided it was just too much money to
pass up. Not many communities have this type of opportunity.''
   Mrs. Morgan died March 4 at a nursing home. She and her late
husband, Robert, had amassed their estate by investing in farmland.
The couple had no children.
   ``Everyone knew Bob, but hardly anyone knew her,'' said Mrs.
Morgan's sister-in-law, Laura Dechert. ``She was a dear, sweet lady
but she was quiet.''
   Mrs. Morgan was born in Illinois and spent most of her life in
northwest Kansas, where her husband was a postal carrier in Seldon.
They moved to Oberlin after he retired in 1962.
   Mrs. Dechert said Mrs. Morgan ``sort of gave up'' after her
husband died in 1983 and spent a lot of time indoors before going
to the nursing home. Mrs. Dechert took care of Mrs. Morgan for
seven years and now lives in the Morgans' home.
   Not even her sister-in-law knows why Mrs. Morgan left the money
to Oberlin.
   ``I was a little disappointed because I think she could have
done more good by spreading it around a little. I think it put
Oberlin in kind of a bind,'' she said.
   The will stipulates that construction on the municipal
auditorium must begin within two years after Mrs. Morgan's death.
That is March 4, 1992.
   Mrs. Morgan's attorney, Kenneth Clark of Hill City, said the
town had talked about a municipal auditorium. Mrs. Morgan thought
it was a good idea to have such a building, which townspeople
envision as a place for agricultural events and entertainment that
also could have offices, a kitchen, meeting rooms and an indoor
pool.
   ``She figured if she was willing to give them most of their
estate, they would be willing to match it,'' Clark said. ``And she
put the two-year deadline on it because she was a lady who liked to
get things done.''
   The exact amount of money involved will not be known until the
Morgans' farms are sold and other bequests are paid. But attorneys
and city officials estimate Oberlin will have to raise about $1
million.
   If Oberlin doesn't raise the money, it will go to the Shrine
Burn Center in Galveston, Texas, a beneficiary of the Masonic Lodge
that Morgan belonged to.
   The town has set aside $60,000 to study the issue and plans to
pursue state, federal and arts foundation grants. Fear said a bond
issue would be a last resort to raise money, but ``the local
community is going to have to support it somehow.''
   ``This is a town willing to take a risk,'' said Mayor Idella
Frickey. ``It is a town that gets things done. And I think we'll
get this thing done, too.''
   In a time when many small farming communities are struggling,
this town nestled in the short-grass prairie 380 miles west of
Kansas City and 230 miles east of Denver appears to be thriving.
   The red brick streets wind through a town with a strong business
community and several new homes. A $2.5 million renovation of the
hospital and nursing home was recently completed.
   The city also runs its own carnival and theater. Local investors
have helped start private enterprises, such as boat and bus
factories.
   Frickey says she is sure conflicts will arise over plans for the
building. But she and Fear acknowledge it is a pleasant burden.
   ``How many small towns in this part of the country wouldn't like
to have a $1 million gift?'' Fear asked. ``We're sure not going to
give it up without a fight.''

<HEAD>Frank Releases Letter from Landlady</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank was ``stunned'' to discover
that his Capitol Hill home was being used by a male prostitute to
sell sex, according to a letter written by Frank's former landlady
and released Thursday.
   Frank released the letter in response to comments by a female
prostitute who said the Massachusetts Democrat knew that Stephen
Gobie was running a prostitution ring from the apartment.
   The House ethics committee is investigating Frank's relationship
with Gobie.
   The female prostitute insisted that Frank knew his residence
doubled as a brothel. The woman, who said she sold sexual services
from Frank's apartment along with Gobie, reportedly is telling her
story to the committee.
   Frank said the woman's statements, which first appeared in the
March issue of Penthouse magazine, ``are complete lies, fabricated
stories about events which did not happen.''
   The former landlady, Mary Jo Daugherty, gave her sworn statement
Oct. 25 to the ethics committee, officially the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct.
   She said she became aware in the summer of 1987 that different
women _ and, on one occasion, men _ would visit Gobie at Frank's
residence.
   ``Until this type of activity began to occur, it never dawned on
me that prostitution might be taking place,'' she said, noting that
Frank had moved into the basement apartment in 1983.
   ``I called Congressman Frank and reported what I had observed,''
Mrs. Daugherty said. ``He seemed stunned. I never saw Gobie again.''
   She said ``none of the activities'' occurred when Frank was
present.
   ``It is my strong belief, based on my knowledge of both
Congressman Frank and Mr. Gobie, that Gobie took advantage of
Congressman Frank and had begun to misuse the apartment without
Congressman Frank's knowledge or permission,'' she told the
committee.
   Frank, a homosexual, has admitted that he paid Gobie for sex
when they first met. However, Frank said he later hired Gobie as a
personal aide in an effort to turn Gobie's life around. Gobie has
said Frank knew sex was being sold from the apartment.
   The investigation has proved troubling to the committee, as
members grapple with incidents involving personal behavior. Some
committee members reportedly are holding out for a recommendation
that Frank be punished on grounds he discredited the House.
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., has promised to introduce a
resolution to expel Frank _ a move that would force at least a
procedural vote.
   Frank, first elected in 1980, has announced he's running for
re-election.

<HEAD>House Sends Gun Waiting Period Bill to Connecticut Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut residents would have to wait
two weeks before buying any gun so that authorities could conduct
criminal background checks under a bill approved by the Legislature.
   A national gun-control group pushing a similar bill at the
federal level called the Connecticut vote Wednesday an important,
``common-sense'' victory. But anti-gun-control forces said bill
would do nothing to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.
   Earlier this year, California became the first state to enact a
waiting-period law.
   Gov. William A. O'Neill, a gun owner whose administration
recently put up $25 million in state pension funds to save Colt's
Manufacturing Co., a Hartford-based gun maker, has said he would
sign the bill if it passed.
   It would probably be at least a week before the paperwork
reaches O'Neill's desk, gubernatorial spokesman Jon Sandberg said
Thursday.
   Current Connecticut law requires a waiting period for handguns
only.
   The 76-66 vote in the House of Representatives came after more
than 2{ hours of debate.
   ``In no way does this impede or restrict a law-abiding citizen
from obtaining a weapon,'' said Rep. Joseph S. Raia, a city police
officer who marshaled support for the bill.
   Others said the measure infringed on the constitutionally
protected right to keep and bear arms. Opponents failed to attach
several amendments that would have weakened the bill.
   Exempted from the waiting-period requirements are police
officers, members of the armed services and anyone who has a pistol
permit or hunting license.
   ``Today, in a state where many of America's guns are made, the
Legislature showed that common sense can prevail,'' said Sarah
Brady, chair of Handgun Control Inc.
   Susan Misiora, lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, said
the bill would do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of
criminals.
   ``Criminals just don't go to gun stores,'' Misiora said, adding
that a waiting period implies that ``you're guilty until proven
innocent.''

<HEAD>NATO Sees Diminished Need For Nuclear Artillery</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with final statement saying need for
battlefield nuclear weapons diminished. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANANASKIS, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its NATO allies
agreed today there is a ``diminishing need'' for battlefield
nuclear weapons in its alliance arsenal given the recent political
changes in Eastern Europe.
   NATO also welcomed the prospect of early negotiations with the
Soviet Union on cutting short-range nuclear missile forces.
   The 14 defense ministers of the NATO's Nuclear Planning Group
also called on the Soviet Union to make ``substantial reductions''
unilaterally in its short-range nuclear missile systems.
   The statement came as the group wrapped up its two-day session
in Kananaskis at a Rocky Mountain ski resort.
   The alliance's statement follows President Bush's recent
decision to cancel the development of new tactical nuclear missiles
and artillery systems designed for deployment by the NATO allies.
   The alliance statement did not address calls by the Dutch and
West Germans for unilateral NATO withdrawal of its hundreds of
aging nuclear artillery shells, which are designed to be shot on
European battlefields at very close range in the event of an
overwhelming Warsaw Pact conventional attack.
   ``Given the political and military changes now taking place in
Central and Eastern Europe, together with the prospect of early
signature and implementation of a Conventional Forces in Europe
treaty, we agreed that there is a diminishing need for nuclear
systems of the shortest range,'' it said.
   The alliance ministers welcomed Bush's decision to cancel the
planned update of nuclear weaponry and said it ``demonstrates once
again the ability of the alliance to take the initiative in a
rapidly changing situation.''
   The alliance ministers said they welcomed ``the prospect of
early negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union
on short-range nuclear missile systems and emphasized the
importance of consultation within the alliance on the development
of objectives for these negotiations.''
   While the alliance members agreed on the need to cut NATO's
short-range nuclear arsenal, they left decisions on how deep those
reductions should be to the leaders of the NATO summit nations who
will meet in London in early July.
   The alliance ministers said that they recognized that a
lessening need for short-range nuclear weapons means ``relatively
greater importance'' on sub-strategic nuclear weapons that offer
``both flexibility and longer range.''
   This appeared to be a reference to an alliance interest to shift
a greater reliance on air-launched nuclear weapons, which are
already based in Europe and slated for upgrading sometime during
this decade.
   The ministers said they wanted their aides as well to step up
work on a lengthy study of how to best reduce the alliance's
nuclear stockpile amid the rapidly changing political and military
environment in Europe.
   It was the pact's first evaluation of its nuclear weapons
strategy since the dramatic upheavals in Eastern Europe and the
withering of their once-strong adversary, the Warsaw Pact.
   ``There is scope for reductions,'' Britain's defense chief Tom
King said of the tactical nuclear weapons. ``I think there is
general agreement on that.''
   There are some 1,600 aging nuclear-tipped artillery shells based
in West Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. They
are designed to be shot at very close range to halt an overwhelming
advance of Warsaw Pact tanks and other conventional forces.
   It isn't known how many short-range artillery shells the Soviets
possess. Generally, the Soviets have relied more on missiles in
their tactical arsenal.
   But with the recent pro-democracy revolutions in Eastern Europe
and the steps being taken toward German unification, the artillery
is seen as increasingly irrelevant to some NATO governments and
their constituents.

<DATELINE>CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, taking issue with
this populous nation's family planning program, told Mexicans today
that it is wrong to use contraceptives.
   ``If, in the conjugal union, the possibility of conceiving a
child is artificially eliminated, the couple closed themselves to
God and opposed his will,'' John Paul admonished a crowd of more
than 100,000 people on the fifth day of his eight day Mexican trip.
   The crowd at the prayer service included thousands of U.S.
residents who traveled to Chihuahua, 220 miles south of El Paso,
Texas.
   Thousands more were expected an an afternoon Mass in Monterrey,
100 miles southwest of Laredo, Texas.
   The pontiff spoke from a platform on a wide soccer field, with
the bare, craggy peaks of the Sierra Madre in the background.
   John Paul, in his homily, reiterated standard Roman Catholic
church policy against artificial birth control, but his message had
clear political implications in Mexico, where the government has
encouraged the use of contraceptives in order to limit a
mushrooming population of 85 million.
   John Paul also paid tribute to Mexican women during the
ceremony, held on the date Latin Americans celebrate Mother's Day.
   On Wednesday night in Durango, John Paul gave a stern lecture to
a group of wealthy businessmen. He said the poor have been hit
hardest by Mexico's economic crisis, while the rich have helped
create even more poverty through greed.
   Mexico, ``despite the inherent resources that the Creator gave
this country, is still very far from the ideal of justice,'' the
pope said Wednesday, noting the vast contrast between the rich few
and the poor majority.
   Business must create more jobs, pay fair salaries and protect
the environment, the pontiff said in the address delivered at a
theater in Durango, 450 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   The speech followed an emotional visit to a nearby prison,
during which the pope mixed with inmates in an unscheduled visit to
the prison yard for 20 minutes.

<HEAD>Religious Coalition Seeks Rehearing on Drug Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unusual coalition of religious groups asked
the Supreme Court on Thursday to reconsider its decision letting
states outlaw the use of illegal drugs as a religious practice.
   ``I seriously doubt these groups have ever been in the same room
together, much less have ever joined in so important an
undertaking,'' Oliver Thomas of the Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs told reporters.
   The April 17 high court ruling said members of the Native
American Church had no constitutional right to take the
hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious ceremonies.
   Officials from the American Jewish Congress, the National
Association of Evangelicals and the National Council of Churches
also participated in a news conference held after the petition for
rehearing was filed with the court.
   Others supporting the petition included the Presbyterian Church
USA, Luthern Church Missouri Synod, American Friends Service
Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and
the Christian Legal Society.
   Religious leaders were more disturbed by the court's method of
deciding the case than by the decision's bottom line.
   Five members of 6-3 court majority agreed that religious beliefs
cannot excuse failure to comply with ``otherwise valid laws
prohibiting conduct states are free to regulate.''
   Departing from a long series of prior cases, the court did not
require states to have a ``compelling reason'' before forcing
someone to comply with laws interfering with religious beliefs.
   The court's new reasoning, said Robert P. Dugan Jr. of the
National Association of Evangelicals, ``effected a sea change in
freedom-of-religion law.''
   Henry Siegman of the American Jewish Congress said that if the
decision remains, ``all Americans ... will have reason to feel less
free and more vulnerable under our Constitution.''
   The court rarely grants requests for reconsideration, and Thomas
acknowledged Thursday's move was ``a long shot.''
   ``Nevertheless, it is our only shot,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Says Arms Collaboration May Undermine U.S. Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States may be mortgaging its future
defenses by not limiting collaboration with allied nations in
high-tech weapons development, according to a congressional study
released Thursday.
   Such collaboration makes business sense for the companies
involved but may ultimately make the United States too dependent on
foreign suppliers and erode parts of the U.S. defense industrial
base, said the study by the Office of Technology Assessment, a
nonpartisan analytical agency of the Congress.
   More joint weapons projects with European or Japanese companies
will mean less business for all but the largest American defense
companies, the study said.
   ``The United States could end up with a defense industrial
structure inadequate for the defense of the nation,'' it said.
   The study added, on the other hand, that erosion of U.S. defense
industries may not be a security risk because the United States may
need less weapon-making capacity as the Cold War winds down and
East-West arms cuts are implemented.
   Even so, the trend toward greater U.S.-European collaboration is
casting doubt on America's long-held commitment to global
superiority in weapons technology, the study said. Traditionally
the United States has kept this edge by focusing on military
applications for new technologies, with little regard for possible
civilian uses.
   Now, as defense industry competition heats up in the post-Cold
War period, the focus of multinational defense collaboration will
be on dual-use technologies, it said.
   This ``might ultimately undermine the position of the United
States as a military superpower _ because dual-use technologies
would be available to many nations,'' the study said. ``In time,
the U.S. military position might degenerate to the status of first
among equals.''
   The study quoted an unidentified high-ranking military officer
as saying, ``If we want to stay a superpower, we will invest to be
ahead of the world in next-generation systems. ... Otherwise, we
are co-developing and therefore not leading. We lose the superpower
label.''
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Armed Services
subcommittee on defense industry and technology, took a different
view, saying more U.S. emphasis on dual-use technologies would help
the domestic industry survive leaner times.
   ``In light of the declining defense budgets of the 1990s, we may
need to concentrate more of our cooperation both with our European
allies and especially with Japan on dual-use technology ... rather
than full-scale weapons systems,'' he said.

<HEAD>WHO Defers PLO Bid to Become Voting Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization indefinitely
postponed a decision on whether to admit the PLO's State of
Palestine as a full voting member, thus averting the threat of a
withdrawal of U.S. funds.
   The U.N. agency's annual assembly adopted by consensus a
resolution sponsored by 28 West European, Third World and Arab
countries. The resolution called on WHO Director-General Dr.
Hiroshi Nakajima to ``continue his studies'' on the Palestinian
membership bid and report back ``at an appropriate time.''
   By not setting a deadline, the 167-nation assembly indefinitely
postponed consideration of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
application.
   The measure also called on WHO to continue a special health
program to help the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
   John Bolton, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international
organization affairs, said he hoped the decision would end attempts
to politicize WHO.
   ``WHO should return to life and death issues such as controlling
AIDS, helping to develop a vaccine against malaria ... and
fostering health care everywhere,'' he told delegates.
   The PLO has been campaigning to gain recognition as an
independent state by becoming a full member of U.N. organizations.
It currently has non-voting observer status with WHO.
   But Dr. Fathi Arafat, head of the Palestinian delegation and
brother of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, said he did not see the
decision as a rejection of the membership bid.
   He said the PLO would not give up its campaign for membership in
international organizations.
   More than 100 countries, many in the Third World, have
recognized the ``State of Palestine'' declared by the PLO's
parliament-in-exile in November 1988.
   The United States, backed by most Western countries, maintains
the PLO is not entitled to full membership in U.N. organizations
because it does not meet internationally recognized criteria of
statehood, such as control of territory.
   Washington has pledged $78 million to WHO this year, or 25
percent of the agency's budget. It is also a major sponsor of WHO
programs outside the regular budget, including the campaign against
AIDS.
   U.S. officials said a U.S. funds cutoff would be
``devastating,'' and WHO chief Nakajima had warned that all major
programs such as the fight against tropical diseases would have to
be slashed. Nakajima said he was ``extremely pleased''with the
outcome of the session.
   In 1989, fears of a withdrawal of U.S. financing prompted a WHO
assembly to defer a decision until this year on the PLO bid.
   Diplomats said fears of the U.S. aid cutoff prompted Thursday's
decision as well.
   The assembly called on WHO to continue its ``special technical
assistance to improve the health conditions of the Palestinian
people in the occupied territories.'' Nakajima said the program
budget was $18 million over two years.
   A report to the assembly by a special committee cited high
infant mortality rates and poor health care facilities in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``The incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases such as
anaemia among pregnant women and children are increasing
significantly,'' it said. ``Mental diseases are presenting
increasingly serious problems on account of the increase in
violence in the region.''
   The report is to be discussed later in the meeting, which began
Monday and runs for two weeks.

   A twin-engine plane crashed
today as it tried to land in this southeastern city, killing 26 of
the 38 people on board, the manager of the airline said. Most were
headed to see the pope.
   The plane crashed this morning nearly two miles short of a
runway at Military Air Base No. 6 on the outskirts of Tuxtla
Gutierrez, Miguel Angel Guadarrama, manager of Aviacion de Chiapas,
S.A., said.
   ``There were 38 people on board, including the crew, and 12 of
them survived. The rest died. Many of the passengers, in fact most
of them, were government officials,'' Guadarrama said in a
telephone interview.
   The medical condition of the survivors was not immediately known.
   An unconfirmed report said a Roman Catholic bishop was among the
fatalities. An earlier television report said that about 28 people
had died.
   Guadarrama said the cause of the crash was under investigation.
   Live television coverage from the scene showed a badly charred
wreck with twisted propellers scattered in a field. Soldiers
surrounded it, keeping back several hundred onlookers.
   Despite the security, the live broadcast showed looting of
luggage scattered by the crash.
   The plane, a propeller driven F-27 Fokker made in Holland, was
on a scheduled run from Tapachula, on the border with Guatemala.
Officials said many of the government people were coming for Pope
John Paul's visit to Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas
state, on Friday.
   Aviacion de Chiapas, or Avicsa, is a regional commercial airline
that operates in southeastern Mexico and uses the military base.
The pope will be traveling through the Tuxtla Gutierrez municipal
airport.
   The government news agency Notimex quoted an unidentified source
at the Roman Catholic archdiocese in Chiapas as saying that among
those killed was Tuxtla Gutierrez Bishop Luis Miguel Canton Marin.
   However, Guadarrama said he did not have a complete passenger
list and could not immediately confirm the report.
   The plane can carry up to 44 passengers and a crew of four.

<HEAD>Private Colleges Provide $2.3 Billion in Student Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Student financial aid provided by private
colleges to attract low-income and minority students more than
doubled from 1970 to 1987, an association of the schools said
Thursday.
   But Richard Rosser, president of the National Institute of
Independent Colleges and Universities, said such aid cannot
continue to grow at that pace without the colleges jeopardizing
``their own financial health and commitments to other areas of
need.''
   An institute study, entitled ``A Commitment to Access,'' said
that independent colleges and universities provided $2.34 billion
from their own resources for financial assistance to undergraduate
students in the 1987-88 school year, a 102 percent increase,
adjusted for inflation, over 1970-71.
   ``The federal government's commitment to providing student
financial assistance, especially in the form of grants, must be
strengthened if low-income and middle-income students are going to
be allowed the choice of an education best suited for them. The
independent sector cannot do it alone,'' he said.
   More than three-quarters of the growth occurred since the
1980-81 school year, the study said, estimating that the figure
reached $2.626 billion in 1988-89.
   In the 1975-76 school year, federal aid was almost 3{ times the
aid provided by the institutions themselves, Rosser said, adding
that ``independent colleges and universities now provide more grant
assistance to undergraduates than all federal student aid grants
combined.''
   Federal aid, he said, now focuses on the ``truly needy'' with
little help for students from middle-class families. The schools
also provide little aid to middle-class students.
   More than 85 percent of the aid provided by private colleges in
1987-88, $2 billion, was awarded as grants and scholarships. Other
aid was offered as loans and work-study grants.
   In the 1986-87 term, expenses for a typical private-college
student receiving aid averaged $10,300 for tuition, fees, room and
board. An average of $7,300 was provided in financial aid, grants,
loans and work-study, leaving the student out-of-pocket expenses of
about $3,000.
   The study said that on average 59 percent of all undergraduates
attending independent colleges and universities received some form
of institutionally provided aid in 1987-88, up from 44 percentin
1970-71.
   To finance increased student aid, Rosser said, private colleges
are often forced to keep faculty salaries low, defer maintenance
and cut back on purchases of library material and science equipment.

<HEAD>Kurosawa's ``Dreams'' Opens Cannes Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stars from around the world gathered
Thursday for the 43rd annual Cannes Film Festival, but the man of
the hour was 80-year-old Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.
   His new film, ``Dreams,'' provided a dignified and imaginative
opening for 12 days of partying, salesmanship and awards-giving in
the seaside city.
   Based on Kurosawa's dreams, the film is eight separate segments,
including one in which a filmmaker confronts Vincent Van Gogh in a
wheat field, and another about mountain climbers facing death in a
blizzard.
   ``Dreams'' is not among the 19 films competing for the coveted
top prize, the Golden Palm. This year's entries include offerings
from the Societ Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, China, Burkina Faso,
Great Britain and Italy.
   A preview of ``Dreams'' was held in the afternoon.
   The 10-member jury that will choose the winner of the Golden
Palm is headed by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci and includes
American actress Anjelica Huston, French actress Fanny Ardant, and
English screenwriter Christopher Hampton, who wrote the English
adaptation of ``Liaisons Dangereuses.''
   American offerings in competition for the Golden Palm include
Clint Eastwood's ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' based on John
Huston's filming of ``African Queen'' in 1952; David Lynch's ``Wild
at Heart,'' and an American production by English director Alan
Parker, ``Come See the Paradise.''
   The French are offering four films, including Jean-Paul
Rappeneau's ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' starring Gerard Depardieu and
``New Wave,'' starring Alain Delon and directed by Jean-Luc Godard.
   But it was ``Dreams'' that created the stir.
   At a news conference after the preview, Kurosawa said he had
been inspired to write down his dreams by a Dostoevski passage ``in
which the author said dreams revealed men's deepest thoughts,
liberated in sleep.''
   He then decided to make a film about his dreams, but he left out
three of his best ``because technically they were too difficult, or
expensive enough to bankrupt the producer.''
   While some dreams had a nightmare quality, others were
beautiful, such as one concerning the director in an imaginary
encounter with Van Gogh, played by Martin Scorsese.
   Akira Terao was lauded for his interpretation of a younger
Kurosawa.
   ``I was trembling at doing the different parts,'' he said. ``But
Mr. Kurosawa told me to just `be natural,' and then I felt better.
While being natural is difficult, it gave me reassurance
nonetheless.''
   Kurosawa fielded questions about his film with aplomb.
   ``I think none of my many films has more than two or three
moments of pure cinema,'' said the director of ``The Seven
Samurai'' and ``Ran,'' and winner of a special award at this year's
Oscar ceremony in Hollywood.
   ``I wanted to have more moments of pure and perfect cinema with
`Dreams,' but while I did my best, I don't think I got much more
than those two or three moments.''
   ``Which were they?'' asked a reporter.
   ``That's for you to decide,'' said Kurosawa.

<HEAD>Greenspan Outlines Proposal for Banking Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Thursday outlined the central bank's ideas for reforming the
nation's financial system, including charging banks with risky
investments more for their deposit insurance.
   In his first extensive public remarks on deposit insurance
reform, Greenspan told a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference
that the issue ``should be high on our agenda'' as Congress and the
Bush administration consider permitting banks to expand into
securities and insurance.
   Among the specific reforms he suggested were varying deposit
insurance premiums according to the riskiness of a bank's
investments, more frequently examining banks' books, more swiftly
seizing weak banks and requiring bank owners to risk more of their
own money.
   Greenspan did not address such proposals as cutting back on the
$100,000 per-account insurance, limiting insurance to one account,
imposing a ``deductible'' on the insurance or finding a way to
allow large banks to fail without endangering the system.
   ``He is proceeding gingerly ... but in the chairman are the
seeds of a most radical reform of our existing financial system,''
said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents
smaller banks wary of deposit insurance changes.
   The Treasury Department is due to release its banking reform
plan by February. Greenspan is expected to be a major influence in
that plan's development and in congressional debate on the issue
next year.
   Greenspan appeared to reject the notion of simply doing away
with deposit insurance and other safeguards, which some free-market
conservatives advocate.
   ``The United States has not suffered a financial panic or
systemic bank run in the last 50 years. In large part this reflects
the safety net,'' he said.
   But the protection comes at a cost, he said. Three parts of the
safety net pose a ``moral hazard'' for bankers by allowing them to
shift some of the risks of their actions onto the public.
   They are deposit insurance, the ability of banks to borrow at
low rates in emergencies from the Fed's discount window and banks'
access the Fed's electronic payments wire, which guarantees
payments between banks.
   Reform of the safety net, Greenspan said, should be considered
in tandem with expanding bank powers.
   Offering banks no new powers likely would cause commercial
banking to shrink in relationship to the rest of the financial
system. That, in turn, ``may create systemic risk similar to that
faced in earlier years.''
   Bank owners now risk about six cents of every dollar they lend.
However, Greenspan noted that in the 1800s, before the creation of
deposit insurance and the discount window, bankers risked 25 cents
to 50 cents for every dollar they loaned. That encouraged them to
use more caution.
   A text of Greenspan's speech, delivered at the Chicago Fed's
Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, was released
in Washington.

   Britain's Prince Charles and Princess
Diana on Thursday ended their first visit to a Warsaw Pact country
by viewing Budapest from a boat on the Danube and taking a
streetcar ride through the city center.
   The royal couple delighted Hungarians and made front-page news.
During a speech Tuesday, Charles was full of praise for Hungary's
pioneering role in Eastern Europe's transformation. His wife drew
admiration for her charm, her smiles and her elegant clothes.
   About 2,000 people crowded a square adjoining the Danube to
greet the prince and princess after their streetcar ride. Costumed
folk dancers delivered a traditional send-off.
   ``After so many hard years, only now that I see them here on the
streets of Budapest and see everyone freely expressing their
enthusiasm do I really believe that things have changed,'' said
Emilia Imredi, a 68-year-old pensioner.

   An obsessed fan who allegedly broke into the
home of actress Sharon Gless wrote numerous love letters to her for
years, Gless testified.
   The Emmy-award winning star of the television show ``Cagney and
Lacey,'' said she dismissed the letters because they contained no
threats. Miss Gless testified Wednesday at a preliminary hearing
for Joni Leigh Penn in San Fernando Municipal Court on a burglary
charge.
   Police say Penn, 30, was carrying a semiautomatic assault rifle
and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition March 30 when she barricaded
herself in Gless' home for seven hours. Police say she planned to
sexually assault Gless and then commit suicide. She is being held
without bail.
   In a similar case, a federal judge declined to dismiss charges
against a man accused of sending threatening letters to ``Remington
Steele'' TV actress Stephanie Zimbalist.
   Michael Lawrence Shields, 42, of Plymouth, Mich., contended his
case should be thrown out because he was examined by a prosecution
psychiatrist without a court order. The judge instead barred
prosecutors from using the psychiatric report.

   Milwaukee Brewers infielder Gary Sheffield
says verbally abusive police put a gun to his head during a
confrontation in which New York Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden tried to
intervene.
   The same two baseball players got into a brawl with officers in
1986, resulting in probation for Gooden for resisting arrest and
battery. That incident brought Tampa's police harsh scrutiny after
Gooden, who is black, charged racial discrimination.
   Sheffield said police stopped him and a friend outside a
nightspot March 14, and Gooden, who was driving behind them, tried
to intervene. Sheffield is Gooden's nephew.
   ``I said, `I'm Gary Sheffield and I'm a professional
ballplayer.' They said, `I don't care who you are, you're driving a
dope dealer's car,' and they threw me up against the car.''
   Sheffield and his friend Chuck Jones said they filed complaints
with the police internal affairs bureau. Police on Thursday cited
confidentiality laws and refused to say whether a complaint had
been filed.
   ``My complaint was, `I've been harassed too much, and my life
was in danger,''' Sheffield said, according to Thursday's St.
Petersburg Times.
   It remained unclear what may have led police to mistake
Sheffield's black Mercedes-Benz for a drug dealer's car.
   Deputy Police Chief Tom DePolis refused to say whether Sheffield
and Gooden were involved in a confrontation with his officers.
   Gooden had no comment, said his agent, Jim Neader.

   Columbia Pictures Television has offered a
record $32 million to keep writers Ron Leavitt and Michael Moye,
who write the comedy series ``Married ... With Children,'' a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The writers are considering a three-year contract renewal that
includes a significant share of syndication profits from
``Married,'' the Los Angeles Times reported. Their contract with
Columbia expires in November.
   Columbia produces the show, about the disrespectful family of a
shoe salesman, for Fox Broadcasting Co.'s network.
   The writers' agent, Cary Cosay of Leading Artists Agency, said
Wednesday that no deal had been reached. Gary Lieberthal, chairman
of Columbia Pictures, declined to comment.
   The stakes have risen in the talks because Columbia is preparing
a highly publicized campaign to sell reruns of ``Married'' to local
stations. Depending on how much the stations pay, Columbia could
gross $124 million to $153 million for ``Married,'' not including
revenue from advertising sales, the Times said.
   The Disney and Universal studios have expressed interest in
signing up the writing team, but have been unable to match
Columbia's immediate advance against syndication revenues, the
newspaper said.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor is going ahead with a benefit
for the homeless. A judge had chastised her for counting time she
had spent on the project toward fulfilling a sentencing obligation.
   In addition to three days in jail, which she is appealing, Miss
Gabor was sentenced to serve 120 hours of community service at a
shelter for homeless women for slapping a police officer.
   Miss Gabor spent 34 hours at the shelter answering phones and
handing out food, and the rest of the time raising money and
planning a gala fund-raiser for the shelter June 5 at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel.
   ``I will do everything I can to save the group from financial
trouble,'' Miss Gabor said Tuesday.
   But Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles Rubin wouldn't give
her credit for fund raising. And as punishment, he tagged on 60
hours to the time she must spend at the shelter for her October
conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle officer.
   She said her celebrity friends have rallied to the fund-raiser.
Phyllis Diller has donated a $4,000 oil painting for auction and
sister Eva Gabor, actress Valerie Harper and Bob Hope have promised
items.
   In addition, a Los Angeles car dealer will donate an automobile
for auction and Miss Gabor is throwing in a sable coat and other
personal items.

   City officials seeking a non-sexist
term for ``manhole'' ducked the issue. They decided to take no
formal action on the contest, even though they received suggestions
from as far away as New Zealand.
   Among the ideas were ``sewer viewers,'' ``peopleholes'' or even
``peepholes.''
   The decision will be taken informally and will not require
formal council action, a spokeswoman for the City Council said
Wednesday.
   ``We do have a commitment to change any offensive terminology,
but we just do it internally. It's no big deal,'' said Christine
Olsen, a city spokeswoman.
   Prompted by sensitivity to the City Council's first female
majority, the Public Works Department last month called for
suggestions to replace the term for ``manhole,'' and said it was
holding an informal, tongue-in-cheek contest to come up with
gender-neutral substitute.
   ``The calls came in from everywhere,'' Ms. Olsen said.
   Some people are calling with ``lewd and offensive suggestions,''
a city receptionist said, while others want to know about ``the
women who are taking over the City Council.''
   Olsen stressed that the five women on the nine-member council
had nothing to do with the Public Works Department contest.
   A radio station in Hamilton, New Zealand _ Sacramento's sister
city _ held a renaming contest in which ``sewer viewer'' captured
the prize.
   Olsen said many city workers for years have called the things

   Students and administrators at
Exeter-West Greenwich School District spent a year searching for a
nickname for their new high school. They finally picked Scarlet
Knights.
   But officials at Rutgers University in New Jersey didn't think
it sounded so good.
   Rutgers Vice President David Pramer said Wednesday the nickname
was a registered trademark of the university, just like Alabama's
Crimson Tide and Notre Dame's Fighting Irish.
   Walter Gibson, assistant superintendent at Exeter-West
Greenwich, said he was disappointed. The selection process required
polling students five times before a nickname was settled on for
the athletic teams at the high school, which is due to open in
September.
   Undaunted, the School Committee has suggested that
Superintendent John F. Eldridge to ask Rutgers for permission again.
   ``If we get a hassle, we'll just go back to the kids and look
for another name,'' Gibson said.

   A federal brochure that
instructs the reader to put on shoes, stay away from the waterfront
and not go sightseeing during an earthquake has not received high
marks from local officials.
   The pamphlet, called ``Self-Help Advice: Earthquakes,'' was
produced by the Canadian government. Among other advice proffered,
the booklet urges people not to injure themselves.
   ``This is a classic case of a person writing a brochure who
doesn't know what people want to read,'' Mayor Gordon Campbell said
Wednesday.
   ``Stay away from waterfront areas? That's not very easy to do
around here,'' said Marilyn Baker, mayor of North Vancouver
district.
   The Greater Vancouver regional district has asked the provincial
government to apply for federal funds so that the regional district
can write its own brochure.

<HEAD>Former Klan Leader Says Race-Relations Lesson Won't Change His
Mind</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference says he will talk about the human family when
he teaches a race-relations course to Klansmen, but not all his
students may be listening.
   ``I don't know what he's going to say, but he's not going to
change my way of thinking,'' said Roger Handley, a former Ku Klux
Klan leader in Birmingham who was accused of attacking an SCLC
march in Decatur in 1979.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who organized the march, is to lead the
course Saturday for the Klansmen as part of a court settlement
growing out of the bloody clash.
   Lowery said he plans to talk about ``the oneness of the human
family'' and how the Klansmen themselves may have been exploited by
demagogic leadership. He said he plans to sit in a circle with the
former Klansmen and attempt an informal discussion.
   Told of Lowery's plan to make the two-hour session informal,
Handley said, ``Good. Maybe I'll convert him.''
   Handley, a 44-year-old disabled sheet-metal worker, called the
discussion a ``waste of time.''
   ``I don't believe in integration, I don't believe in
interbreeding. I don't hate anybody, but I'm not going to change my
way of thinking on that,'' he said.
   Lowery would not disclose the location of the meeting because he
doesn't want reporters to attend.
   ``I don't think the Klan would cooperate if news media people
were sitting in the room,'' he said. ``They've got to protect their
pride, and I think they'd turn it into a circus. There would be no
serious discussion.
   ``At best, it's going to be difficult to have a serious
discussion.''
   ``One of their cyclops up in Connecticut called it `cruel and
unusual punishment,''' Lowery told the Birmingham Post-Herald in a
telephone interview. ``I reckon it might be.''
   The meeting grew out of a lawsuit against the Klan by Montgomery
attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Dees said
that in the Decatur clash, Handley gave the order for Klansmen to
fire on black marchers.
   Four men, two blacks and two whites, were wounded in an exchange
of gunfire.
   An FBI investigation failed to bring criminal charges in 1980,
but information Dees gathered led to criminal indictments for years
later against nine Klansmen, including Handley, who served four
months in prison.
   Handley said he was innocent, but agreed to attend the
race-relations course because ``it was a way to get out of the
lawsuit,'' which Dees filed in U.S. District Court in Huntsville.

   A British airliner nearly
collided with two U.S. Air Force jets Thursday, and two passengers
were injured when the plane's pilot made a nose dive to avoid a
crash, authorities said.
   The Dan-Air British turboprop was carrying 15 passengers,
including a child, and a crew of six on a flight from West Berlin
to Saarbruecken, near the French border.
   Two passengers required hospital treatment for contusions
suffered when they were thrown out of their seats as the plane
dived suddenly, according to a statement released by the Interior
Ministry of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
   A newspaper said the passenger plane missed the two fighters by
50 feet. But an Air Force spokesman estimated the planes were about
500 feet apart.
   A U.S. Air Force statement said the incident involved two F-15
jet fighters from the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing.
   ``The U.S. Air Force pilots and the Dan-Air captain took
successful evasive action and reported the event to the
authorities,'' said a statement issued by the 36th Tactical Fighter
Wing at the Bitburg Air Base.
   A spokesman for West Germany's federal air traffic control
authority said the Dan-Air plane was flying from West Berlin to
Saarbruecken in southern West Germany at the time of the incident.
   Spokesman Hans-Urlich Ohl told The Associated Press the Dan-Air
captain reported seeing only one military jet. He said military
jets usually fly in formations of two and it was possible that the
Dan-Air captain did not see the second jet.
   The captain sent the plane into a nose-dive to avoid a crash,
and several passengers were thrown out of their seats, Ohl said.
   The incident occurred at 11:17 a.m., 24 miles north of
Saarbruecken, Ohl said.
   The British plane, a twin-engine Hawker Siddeley 748, was at an
altitude of 7,590 feet and was preparing to land at the time of the
near-hit, the spokesman said. The plane can carry about 50
passengers.
   The Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper reported that the Dan-Air
plane missed the oncoming jets by 50 feet.
   ``Fifty feet, that's impossible, they would have collided,'' Air
Force Capt. Jerry Brown told The Associated Press. ``We don't know
precisely, but our best estimate is that they were approximately
500 feet apart.''
   The Dan-Air turboprop plane was being guided by the U.S. Air
Force air control at the Ramstein Air Base, Ohl said.
   Airliners serving West Berlin still fly through designated air
corridors controlled by the victorious World War II allies.
   Warplanes from eight NATO countries fly in West German airspace.
   There have been several fatal air accidents in recent years
involving American and other allied aircraft, prompting sharp
demands from West Germans for a stop to low-level military flights
and reduction of other flying activity.

   Medical personnel who use Pulmanex Manual
resuscitators are being asked to return the devices because of a
defect that in some cases could be fatal to patients.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Life Design Systems Inc.
of Carrollton, Texas, is voluntarily recalling resuscitators with
model numbers beginning with 90, 91, 95 or 96 and ending with a 0,
1, 2 or 3 after the hyphen.
   The recalled models have lot numbers 9321 through 9361 and were
made from
   Nov. 17 through Dec. 27 last year.
   In five previous recalls, Life Designs Systems has recalled
other models of the resuscitator for various reasons, the FDA said.
   The agency said it did not know of any deaths that have resulted
from any of the faulty resuscitators.
   The resuscitator subject to the latest recall comes in adult,
pediatric and neonatal sizes. It consists of a mask that is placed
over the patient's mouth and nose and is attached to a plastic bag.
Squeezing the plastic bag forces air into the patient's lungs.
   In faulty resuscitators, the rear valves can become dislodged
and prevent air from reaching the person being resuscitated, the
FDA said. If the problem is not recognized in time, the patient
could die.

<TEXT>
   The weather is favorable for a bumper grain
crop in the Soviet Union this year, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   The department's first forecast of the year predicted the 1990
Soviet grain crop would be 215 million metric tons, up from 211.1
million tons produced last year. It would also be the largest
Russian harvest since the record production of 237.4 million tons
in 1978.
   Officials said the forecast includes 95 million tons of wheat,
106.5 million tons of coarse grains such as barley and sorghum, and
13.5 million tons of miscellaneous grains and pulses.
   Most of the increase from last year would be in wheat, up from
90.5 million tons harvested in 1990.
   Despite the outlook for a bumper harvest, the report said Moscow
will continue to be a large buyer of foreign grain, with 1990-91
imports projected at 36 million tons during the trading year that
will begin July 1. That would be down only slightly from the import
level of the last two years, the report said.

   An 11-year-old girl who says she was fondled
and photographed nude when she attended the McMartin Pre-School
insisted Thursday she could not continue to testify for a second
day at a molestation retrial.
   Under cross-examination, the first child witness in the retrial
of Raymond Buckey began to answer every question regarding her past
allegations by saying, ``I can't remember.''
   Deputy District Attorney Pam Ferrero said the girl's parents
called her Wednesday night saying the child was ``extremely
reluctant'' to return for more questioning. But the parents agreed
to bring her anyway.
   Ms. Ferrero told Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg that the
girl expressed the same desire not to testify when she arrived at
court Thursday but ``was trying to be cheerful'' and agreed to take
the stand.
   Shortly after Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, began asking her
intimate questions about her body, the girl asked, ``May I be
excused? I have a stomach ache.''
   Minutes later, she was observed in the hallway sobbing in her
father's arms. The judge recessed court. After about an hour of
private talks with prosecutors, the child was escorted back to the
witness stand, where her father was allowed to stand next to her
and she clutched a stuffed toy.
   The girl provided no more answers, however, saying she could not
remember events that occurred when she was 3 or 4 years old.
   On Wednesday, the girl denied that Buckey raped or sodomized her
but said he touched her ``in the vagina and the bottom'' as she sat
on his lap. The girl also said she couldn't remember if she was
clothed at the time but recalled that ``I didn't like it.''
   The 31-year-old Buckey is charged specifically with raping the
girl and using a foreign object to sodomize her.
   Buckey's lawyer asked the girl in clear terms whether she had
been raped and sodomized by Buckey and she said she could not
recall that she had.
   In Buckey's first trial she did not take the stand, and the jury
deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal on the two charges.
   The first Buckey trial, the longest and costliest criminal
proceeding in U.S. history, ended in January with Buckey acquitted
of 40 counts of molestation at the family owned preschool in
Manhattan Beach. His mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted
of 12 charges. But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey,
and the district attorney decided to retry him on eight of those
charges involving three children.
   Numerous children in the first trial testified about a ``naked
movie star game'' allegedly played at the school. The 11-year-old
witness made the same claim, saying she and other children took off
their clothes for the game and were photographed nude by Buckey.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Thursday outlined the central bank's ideas for reforming the
nation's financial system, including charging banks with risky
investments more for their deposit insurance.
   In his first extensive public remarks on deposit insurance
reform, Greenspan told a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference
that the issue ``should be high on our agenda'' as Congress and the
Bush administration consider permitting banks to expand into
securities and insurance.
   Among the specific reforms he suggested were varying deposit
insurance premiums according to the riskiness of a bank's
investments, more frequently examining banks' books, more swiftly
seizing weak banks and requiring bank owners to risk more of their
own money.
   Greenspan did not address such proposals as cutting back on the
$100,000 per-account insurance, limiting insurance to one account,
imposing a ``deductible'' on the insurance or finding a way to
allow large banks to fail without endangering the system.
   ``He is proceeding gingerly ... but in the chairman are the
seeds of a most radical reform of our existing financial system,''
said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents
smaller banks wary of deposit insurance changes.
   The Treasury Department is due to release its banking reform
plan by February. Greenspan is expected to be a major influence in
that plan's development and in congressional debate on the issue
next year.
   Greenspan appeared to reject the notion of simply doing away
with deposit insurance and other safeguards, which some free-market
conservatives advocate.
   ``The United States has not suffered a financial panic or
systemic bank run in the last 50 years. In large part this reflects
the safety net,'' he said.
   But the protection comes at a cost, he said. Three parts of the
safety net pose a ``moral hazard'' for bankers by allowing them to
shift some of the risks of their actions onto the public.
   They are deposit insurance, the ability of banks to borrow at
low rates in emergencies from the Fed's discount window and banks'
access the Fed's electronic payments wire, which guarantees
payments between banks.
   Reform of the safety net, Greenspan said, should be considered
in tandem with expanding bank powers.
   Offering banks no new powers likely would cause commercial
banking to shrink in relationship to the rest of the financial
system. That, in turn, ``may create systemic risk similar to that
faced in earlier years.''
   Bank owners now risk about six cents of every dollar they lend.
However, Greenspan noted that in the 1800s, before the creation of
deposit insurance and the discount window, bankers risked 25 cents
to 50 cents for every dollar they loaned. That encouraged them to
use more caution.
   A text of Greenspan's speech, delivered at the Chicago Fed's
Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, was released
in Washington.

   Foreigners continue to own just under 1
percent of the nation's agricultural land, a level that has varied
little over the years, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service made its 1989
year-end review of reports under a 1978 law requiring foreigners to
register U.S. agricultural land holdings.
   As of Dec. 31, 1989, about 12.9 million acres of agricultural
land were owned by foreigners, an increase of 263,273 acres from a
year earlier.
   ``Foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land remained
relatively steady from 1981 through 1989, slightly above or below 1
percent of the privately owned agricultural land in the United
States,'' said John Lee, administrator of the agency.
   Of the land owned by foreign interests, 46 percent was forest
land, 18 percent cropland, 31 percent pasture and other
agricultural land, and 5 percent agricultural land not under
cultivation.
   Corporations, both U.S. and foreign, owned 81 percent of the
foreign-held acreage; partnerships, 10 percent; and individuals, 7
percent. The remainder is held by estates, trusts, associations,
institutions and others.
   Japanese investors owned 2 percent of the foreign-held acreage,
while about 73 percent of the total was owned by investors from
Canada, Britain, West Germany, France, the Netherlands Antilles,
Switzerland and the Netherlands, the report said.
   Maine continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign
ownership, with holdings of almost 2.1 million acres.
   The report said that 93 percent of the foreign-owned acreage
will remain in agricultural production, according to its owners.

<TEXT>
   The worst cyclone to hit India in more
than a decade moved inland Thursday, killing at least 85 people and
leaving hundreds of homes flattened and more than 90 villages under
water.
   The storm first began bashing India's southeastern coast with
heavy rains and tidal surges Tuesday, and it made landfall
Wednesday evening hitting coastal districts along the Bay of Bengal
with winds up to 155 mph.
   By late Thursday, the storm lay over the inland town of
Bhadrachalam, about 105 miles north of the coast. Wind speeds were
decreasing as the cyclone's fury weakened, said officials in
Hyderabad, the capital of Andrha Pradesh state.
   United News of India said winds of 70 to 80 mph would continue
for another three days as the storm moved inland.
   The weather office said the storm was likely to move north and
weaken gradually but that low-lying, heavily populated coastal
regions would continue to receive much rain.
   TV and radio reports said the storm killed 57 people. But local
officials reported a higher death toll, saying at least 75 people
died in Andrha Pradesh and 10 more in neighboring Tamil Nadu state.
   The death toll was expected to rise as rescue workers reached
isolated villages.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least 2 million people in four districts of Andrha Pradesh state
were affected by the cyclone.
   Tens of thousands of people were cut off from rescue workers, as
the heavy rains and towering waves left at least 90 villages under
water, the state-run television said. The storm dumped more than 16
inches of water on the coastal regions.
   But late Thursday, rescue workers did manage to reach the
low-lying coastal village of Yedurumudi, where about 7,000
residents had been marooned by the storm, officials said. They said
it was a miracle that residents were not too badly affected by the
storm.
   Indian news reports said residents there rejected an evacuation
order because the village was not affected by a 1977 cyclone, which
killed more than 10,000 people in southern India.
   Officials said casualties from the current storm were relatively
low because early warnings gave authorities time to evacuate more
than 150,000 people from the coastal districts. In 1977, few people
were evacuated.
   As the storm struck the coast, the high winds and waves up to 33
feet knocked down hundreds of thatched huts and uprooted thousands
of trees.
   Residents who left the coastal town of Machilipatnam, which bore
the brunt of the cyclone, said the streets were waist-deep in water.
   One resident who escaped to Hyderabad said it rained
continuously for 20 hours in Machilipatnam.
   United News of India said thousands of houses were damaged by
gales and heavy rains that lashed the area before and during the
cyclone. Many towns and villages were plunged into darkness as
electricity lines were downed and several power stations severely
damaged, it said. Trains stopped running.
   The news agency quoted officials as saying about 100 telephone
exchanges were damaged, disrupting telecommunications, and the
roads were littered with fallen trees.
   The hardest-hit districts, comprising a small peninsula that
juts out into the Bay of Bengal, were Krishna, East Godavari and
West Godavari, United News said, adding that more than 400,000
people were affected in East Godavari alone.
   The highest casualties were in Krishna district, where 24 people
were killed, the news agency said. At least 33 others died in other
parts of the state, it said.
   Most of the deaths in Andhra Pradesh occurred when walls
collapsed or when flood waters swept people away.
   Cyclones are the Indian Ocean's equivalent of hurricanes. They
usually come in the spring just before the monsoon season begins.

   A man flying to Florida to visit his mother
in a nursing home landed in court for slugging the airline pilot
after being told he was too tipsy for another drink, authorities
said.
   Lonnie Alton Lee, 50, a lawn and pest control worker from
Albuquerque, N.M., has been charged with endangering a commercial
flight, a federal offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
   Lee was en route to Haines City on Tuesday night for a surprise
Mother's Day visit. He was released on a $10,000 signature bond
during an appearance Wednesday before a U.S. magistrate in Tampa.
   Donald T. Woods was piloting Continental Airlines Flight 528
from Denver to Orlando when the incident occurred somewhere over
Alabama.
   A flight attendant refused to serve Lee any more drinks because
he was tipsy and had become belligerent, authorities said.
   Lee began hurling obscenities at the male flight attendant, then
punched Woods in the jaw when he tried to intervene, said FBI
spokesman Larry Curtin.
   Lee was restrained, strapped into his seat until the plane
landed and was arrested, Curtin said.
   Woods told federal agents the blow endangered the flight because
he wore glasses and the swing could have shattered them or
otherwise impaired his vision.
   After asking authorities not to call his mother about the
arrest, Lee told the magistrate he might just skip the holiday
visit and return home.

   Rival Christian forces under Gen. Michel
Aoun and militia chieftain Samir Geagea exchanged artillery and
tank barrages in east Beirut on Thursday, shattering a relative
lull in the fighting.
   Police said four people were killed and eight wounded in the
heavy barrages that erupted after a day of intermittent skirmishes
with machine guns and mortars.
   It was the 101st day of the inconclusive showdown between Aoun
and Geagea for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   A daytime lull gave the exhausted population a chance to emerge
from underground shelters to take stock of damage from the savage
shelling of the previous two days.
   But residents quickly scurried back to their shelters when the
heavy shelling resumed.
   The casualties included a Moslem driver whose vegetable van took
a direct hit from a shell hit at the mid-city Museum gateway that
links east Beirut with the city's Moslem sector across the dividing
Green Line.
   The gateway was opened only minutes before being closed again,
police said.
   The Aoun-Geagea fight has killed 980 people and wounded 2,572
since it erupted Jan. 30.
   The guns generally fell silent by midnight Wednesday, a police
spokesman said. But snipers manning roof-top firing nests kept most
roads blocked in east Beirut and the Christian enclave northeast of
the city.
   Snipers also targeted the Museum gateway, and few civilians
ventured across the dividing line.
   The crackle of automatic fire echoed across the Museum gateway
as a woman and three men sped on foot toward west Beirut. ``Hurry
up, keep your heads down!'' shouted a Moslem soldier on the western
side.
   The four made it safely across and said they were going to stay
with relatives.
   The woman, Janette Elia, said the street where she had lived in
Furn el-Shubbak district was reduced to ``mere piles of rubble,
debris and glass shards.''
   Geagea's men ``fired salvo after salvo of rockets from
multi-barrelled launchers at our street,'' Mrs. Elia said. ``The
rockets came in like endless sea waves, whistling and exploding.''
   Mrs. Elia said she spent the whole day and night Wednesday in
the basement of her home. ``Most of the residents had already fled
to safer areas,'' she said.
   The fighting has forced 400,000 of the enclave's 1 million
residents to flee to safer areas in Lebanon and neighboring
countries, and inflicted damage estimated at $1 billion.
   Aoun's troops and Geagea's fighters also used the lull to defuse
scores of unexploded shells and rockets, remove the rubble that
blocked some streets and resupply their positions with food, water
and ammunition, a police spokesman said.
   ``They are preparing for another round of destruction,'' the
spokesman said. ``The reason for the clash is still there and the
weapons are still there. They'll fight again.''
   The fierce shelling was apparently halted by a cease-fire call
from Maronite patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir. Both Aoun and Geagea are
Maronites too.
   The violence had escalated Wednesday when Aoun imposed
restrictions on sea outlets controlled by Geagea along the 28-mile
Christian coastline.

   China announced Thursday it had released 211
jailed pro-democracy protesters, including several prominent
academics, in a move that appeared timed to head off possible U.S.
trade sanctions.
   Those released include Dai Qing, a leading journalist; Cao
Siyuan, director of a social science research institute; and Li
Honglin, head of the Fujian Provincial Academy of Social Sciences.
   All signed petitions or otherwise showed support for the
democratic reforms demanded last spring by hundreds of thousands of
protesters in Beijing and other cities. The protests ended in June
when the army opened fire on the demonstrators, killing hundreds
and possibly thousands.
   The official Xinhua News Agency described those released as
lawbreakers and said they were ``given lenient treatment and
released upon completion of investigations.''
   It inserted the word ``former'' before the titles of Ms. Dai and
the others, indicating they were fired while in prison.
   ``Coming back home was like a dream,'' Ms. Dai said, contacted
at home by telephone. She said she was let out Wednesday. ``After
10 months, my kitchen is like a stranger.''
   She declined to speak further, saying she would be arrested
again if she talked to a reporter without permission.
   ``We welcome this announcement,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``We are pleased that the official
announcement provided the names of six of those released. We
believe that the interests of all parties would be best served by a
full public accounting of the number and identity of those detained
as well as those released.''
   Ms. Tutwiler added that the Chinese government has not provided
information to date on how many people remain as detainees or as
prisoners. According to unoffical estimates, 10,000 to 15,000 were
detained nationwide at some point but most have been released, she
said.
   ``The official announcement said 431 were still under
investigation by Beijing public security organs but it is not clear
whether all of these are imprisoned,'' she said.
   None of the six listed by Xinhua was a student. Xinhua did not
say if any student leaders were among those released.
   Students at Beijing University said they knew of no students who
had recently been returned to campus.
   Campus sources in Beijing have reported that several student
activists were released in the past few weeks, but none was a top
leader of the pro-democracy movement.
   Xinhua quoted an unidentified spokesman for the Public Security
Ministry as saying only 431 ``lawbreakers involved in the turmoil
and rebellion are still being investigated.'' It said some ``are
being dealt with by judicial departments.''
   The figures still leave hundreds of people unaccounted for.
China previously announced the release of 573 people during the
winter. Arrests reported by the official media last summer alone
totaled more than 2,000, and arrests continued during the fall and
winter.
   Few trials have been publicized, although 20 executions have
been reported in the official press. Sources have reported that
several leading dissidents still in jail have finally been charged
after months of detention, despite Chinese legal requirements that
charges be filed within 45 days.
   The releases came as debate begins in the United States over
whether to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status. The
status, given to all but a handful of nations, substantially
reduces tariffs on goods exported to the United States.
   As a socialist country, China's status must be renewed each
year. President Bush must issue his decision by June 3, and some
congressmen have said they favor suspending most-favored-nation
status as a protest of China's human rights record.
   China has said suspension would set bilateral relations back 20
years. It has insisted it will not yield to foreign pressure, but
last week it ended 14 months of martial law in the Tibetan capital
in what was widely interpreted as an effort to placate critics.
Martial law had been imposed to quell demonstrations against
Chinese rule.
   Prominent protesters from Beijing's democracy movement who
remain in jail include Wang Dan, a Beijing University history major
who was one of the top student leaders, and seven other students
named on a student most-wanted list last summer.
   Five students on that list are known to have escaped China, and
the rest are believed still in hiding.
   Also still in jail are Liu Xiaobo, a university lecturer who
took part in a hunger strike during the last days of protest, and
Ren Wanding, an accountant who gave pro-democracy speeches during
the movement. He was also jailed four years in the early 1980s for
having helped lead an earlier democracy movement.

   Premier Andrei Lukanov said Thursday he
is prepared to head Bulgaria's next government even if his
Socialist Party _ the former Communist Party _ is defeated in
elections next month and forced into a coalition with the
opposition.
   The Socialist Party seeks a firm break with its Stalinist past,
Lukanov said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   The party, which changed its name last month, is ``now dominated
by those who want a new European Socialist party, who are
resolutely anti-Stalinist,'' Lukanov said.
   Bulgaria's Communist Party draws on almost a century of
tradition. In the months immediately following November's ouster of
Todor Zhivkov after 35 years in power, it retained stronger
standing than any other Communist party in eastern Europe.
   But the democratic opposition, while still splintered, has
gained ground and is approaching the elections June 10 and 17 with
confidence.
   Petko Simeonov, a leading opposition figure, predicted Tuesday
that the newly named Socialists would suffer a ``catastrophic
defeat'' at the polls.
   But Lukanov, an economist who is well respected by all political
groups in Bulgaria, maintained the Socialists will emerge as the
strongest political force after the elections.
   He stopped short of predicting a majority for Bulgaria's
erstwhile Communists, in view of the recent electoral defeat of
Hungary's Socialists, who guided their country to peaceful reform.
   Asked if he would be willing to head a government if the
Socialists do not emerge victorious, Lukanov replied, ``If the
party considers this the right thing to do, I would not have a
personal position on it'' and would take the job.
   But he later added, ``this prospect does not make me happy.''
   Several leaders of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces say
they would like to see the savvy Lukanov stay at the helm in a
coalition.
   ``A coalition is necessary. Whoever wins, we need, at least for
a transitory period, a government enjoying, if not 100 percent,
very massive public support,'' Lukanov said.
   ``The political, economic and legal reforms ahead of us are of
such a magnitude, of such complexity that we do not think it
possible for anyone in a single political force to shoulder this,''
he added.

<HEAD>Nuclear Free Zone Vote in Eugene, Ore., Hinges on Economic
Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eugene long has enjoyed a reputation as the
city where the peace crusade of the 1960s did not die, so it wasn't
surprising that voters declared it a nuclear free zone in 1986.
   But as Oregon struggles to diversify its economy to make up for
the decline of the timber industry, residents are confronted with
paying a price for their convictions. On Tuesday, they will decide
whether to toughen the ordinance that bans the local manufacture of
nuclear weapons and their components.
   Although Eugene, population 110,000, is in many ways a timber
town, the presence of the 18,500-student University of Oregon has
given it a liberal tone not found elsewhere in Oregon.
   But the proposed city charter amendment has scared away the
builders of a $15 million factory. One small defense contractor
vows to move out of the city if the nuclear free zone measure
passes.
   Rohr Industries earlier this year decided to build a new jet
engine parts plant in San Marcos, Texas, rather than Eugene. With
it went 250 jobs.
   ``Eugene had made the short list,'' said Jerry Broening,
director of public affairs for Rohr in San Diego. ``Indeed, we had
selected Eugene, tentatively, to locate the facility.
   ``Then it came to our notice that there was this pending
stiffening of the existing nuclear free zone ordinance in Eugene.''
   Supporters launched the latest initiative after the City Council
and a special task force refused to establish an elected board to
oversee the nuclear free zones approved by voters in 1986 and 1988.
The latest initiative would amend the city charter, keeping the
council out of the process.
   A nuclear-free zone in Oakland, Calif., was declared
unconstitutional last month in the federal government's first
lawsuit against a such a law. A federal judge said the ordinance
interfered with exclusive federal control of national defense,
atomic energy and shipments of hazardous materials.
   Steve Johnson, the chief petitioner for the initiative to make
the nuclear free zone part of the city charter, said the Oakland
case shouldn't affect the his proposal because it does not attempt
to directly limit decisions by the federal and state governments,
as Oakland's did.
   And while Eugene's measure would prohibit hauling nuclear wastes
over city streets, it doesn't try to stop passage on Interstate 5
or the railroad, Johnson said.
   Johnson, an adjunct sociology professor at the University of
Oregon, calls the initiative a chance to force the City Council to
finally accept the will of the people as expressed in the previous
nuclear-free votes. ``I thought the voters got a rotten deal,'' he
said.
   But Mike Schwartz, co-chairman of Citizens Against an
Irresponsible Nuclear Free Zone, said the vote is really about
whether people want to see their economy grow.
   ``This is camouflage that people who don't want growth are
using,'' said Schwartz.
   Though nuclear free zone advocates say Rohr wouldn't have been
covered by the ballot measure, Broening said the company didn't
want its future restricted in any way. Besides, it was in a hurry
to build its plant.
   ``We are a subcontractor and our customers ask us to do things
and if they ask us to do things, we respond,'' Broening said. ``We
needed to have a plant in operation by October, which was patently
undoable if we had to wait until June,'' for the outcome of the
vote.
   Robert Ellis is president of Biodynamics, a 10-year-old Eugene
defense contractor that employs 25 people to make flight simulators
and handle secret military projects.
   Ellis finds the local climate so hostile to his company that he
plans to move it if the new nuclear free zone passes.
   ``It's 1969 in Eugene,'' he said. ``For our children there is no
good potential employment in Eugene, Oregon, unless you want to
make belts.''
   David Zupan, a staffer for the organization PeaceWorks who is
active on the nuclear free zone campaign, figures Rohr's decision
should encourage people that the new improved nuclear free zone
will work.
   ``They should be relieved that a company that wants to make
nuclear weapons ... is not coming to Eugene,'' Zupan said.
   ``The impression was that Rohr would employ out-of-work mill
workers,'' Johnson said. ``The fact is these are people they bring
with them or attract from outside the area. We don't have a big
pool with specialty metal fabrication experience.''

<TEXT>
   Johnny Carson still hasn't signed for his 29th
season as the star of NBC's ``Tonight Show.'' But sidekick Ed
McMahon says it's likely Carson will stay on for two more seasons.
   The big-voiced announcer with the booming laugh made his
prediction during an interviewed tape this week for NBC's ``Later
With Bob Costas.'' The interview is scheduled for broadcast May 16.
   McMahon said he'll leave ``Tonight'' when Carson does, and ``the
night he says goodbye, I say goodbye. That's gonna be a sad night.
...''
   Asked if he thought he personally will make it 30 years on the
show, McMahon replied, ``I think so. Yeah, I think so.''
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff has said he
expects that Carson will return next fall. But McMahon noted that
Carson is ambivalent each year about continuing on ``Tonight,''
which has consistently beaten its late-night rivals in ratings.
   ``If it were me, I would say 30 (years),'' he said. ``But Johnny
has his own mind about that. ... He's supposed to tell them (NBC)
pretty soon whether he's going to stay or not. I think right now
he's probably still vacillating.''
   Carson is ``the master of timing,'' McMahon said, ``and he'll
know when it's the right time to go. But I think 30 years would be
wonderful.''

   Jurors began deliberating Thursday whether
a man convicted of poisoning the historic Treaty Oak should be
given a life sentence for the crime.
   Paul Stedman Cullen, 46, was convicted in state district court
Wednesday of poisoning the beloved landmark in what authorities
said was an occult ritual. Because he was previously convicted of a
felony _ burglary _ he faces a maximum sentence of 99 years or life
in prison. The minimum sentence is five years.
   Cullen refused to comment as he was led from the courtroom by
sheriff's deputies after his conviction Wednesday. His father
insisted his son hadn't harmed the tree.
   ``They convicted an innocent man,'' said Paul Cullen Sr.
   The tree, estimated to be as much as 500 years old, was poisoned
with Velpar, a powerful liquid herbicide, early in 1989. News
reports about the case brought international attention to the giant
live oak tree, which according to legend was the site of a treaty
signing between Stephen F. Austin and Indians.
   About two-thirds of the tree is now dead, foresters said, but
the remaining third is still producing leaves.
   Cullen was arrested in June after bragging to a woman that he
poisoned the tree, authorities said.
   During the eight-day trial, prosecutors said Cullen poisoned the
Treaty Oak as part of an occult ritual to both protect a woman he
liked and to ``kill'' his love for her.
   Cullen's attorneys tried to portray him as a lonely loser who
claimed he poisoned the tree to impress a woman.
   ``That's the key to this entire case,'' defense attorney Terry
Kirk said. ``He wanted her to think that he was somebody.''
   Since the poisoning was discovered, more than $100,000 has been
donated to to pay for extraordinary measures that were taken to try
to save the tree. Velpar-contaminated dirt was removed from around
its roots, the tree has been doused with spring water and elaborate
sun screens were built to shade it.

<HEAD>US Worried About Election Process in Romania; Recalls Ambassador</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is recalling its ambassador
to Romania as a signal of displeasure over intimidation and
harassment of opposition parties, the State Department said
Thursday.
   The recall of Ambassador Alan Green was based on ``reports of
irregularities in the Romanian electoral process which raise
questions about whether those elections will be free and fair,''
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   She said Green will return to Bucharest in time for the May 20
elections when Romanians will vote for a president and a bicameral
parliament.
   Anti-communist demonstrators in Romania contend the elections
are being manipulated by the interim government in a way that could
lead to domination by communists previously associated with the
regime of the late president, Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Government leaders maintain that they were, for the most part,
dissidents who suffered under Ceausescu's rule.
   Ms. Tutiler said, ``We have urged the interim Romanian
government to take more vigorous steps to maintain order and to
protect the rights of all candidates in these elections.''
   Among the electoral problems she cited were the incidence of
``organized acts of intimidation and harassment directed against
some opposition parties and candidates.
   ``We are also concerned about complaints that several major
parties still encounter obstacles in obtaining their fair share of
broadcast time on the publicly controlled radio and television and
in distributing their campaign literature through the mail, as well
as problems with distributing independent newspapers,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   She said a fair election is crucial to the further
democratization in Romania and to good relations with the United
States.
   The International Human Rights Law Group, a private research
organization, issued a report expressing concerns similar to those
of the State Department.
   The report said there is widespread apprehension throughout
Romania that the National Salvation Front, which dominates the
interim government, has unfair advantages over other parties.
   A Law Group delegation which visited Romania in April said it
could not judge the truth of the allegations ``but the belief that
these advantages exist is pervasive and has created deep resentment
in many sectors of the population,'' the report said.
   If the allegations are not promptly addressed, it said, ``there
is a risk that the election process will be regarded by substantial
segments of the politically active population as not being free and
fair, and therefore that the legitimacy of the elected government
will be questioned.''

<HEAD>Mandela Arrives in Angola and Gives Thanks For Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela arrived Thursday for his
first visit to Angola and thanked the Marxist government and its
allies for supporting his African National Congress in its struggle
against white-minority rule in South Africa.
   Mandela, in an emotional speech to tens of thousands of Angolans
packing Luanda's dusty May 1 Square, said, ``I pay tribute to
comrade President (Jose Eduardo) dos Santos, his government and the
Angolan people for all the help they have given us.''
   ``The progress we have made in our struggle is owed largely to
Angola, and we hope that one day we will be as free as you,'' said
Mandela.
   Mandela, shielded from the blazing midday sun by an umbrella,
also praised Cuban President Fidel Castro and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for helping independence movements in southern
Africa.
   He described Cuba as a poor country economically but said,
``There's one thing where that country stands out head and
shoulders above the rest _ that is in its love for human rights and
liberty.''
   He said he hoped to visit Havana and Moscow soon.
   Last week, the ANC agreed in principle with South African
President F.W. de Klerk to seek a peaceful end to apartheid and
minority rule in South Africa.
   But Mandela's speech in Luanda mixed optimism for peace with
revolutionary rhetoric, more reminiscent of the battle cries of the
mid-1970s when Angola became host to at least seven major ANC
military training bases.
   Angola's prominent military and logistic aid to the movement
ended in 1988 as part of a regional peace accord with South Africa
and Cuba.
   Those U.S.-brokered agreements also set terms for Namibian
independence, the withdrawal of some 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola, and the end of South African support to UNITA rebels
fighting Angola's government.
   According to Mandela, the ANC ``has noted the moves afoot to
bring about peace in Angola ... and we support those moves.''
Heavy, sustained applause from the crowd followed his words.
   ``We are distressed that such a great and beautiful country is
split from top to bottom by a civil war that has been engineered by
South Africa and other hostile powers,'' said Mandela.
   He promised unspecified ANC support for the Angolan government.
   South African troops fought alongside UNITA in the field against
Angolan government forces and their Cuban allies from 1975.
   Dos Santos claimed Thursday that former South African President
Pieter Botha offered to cease aid to UNITA if Luanda agreed to halt
support for the South West African People's Organization. It
recently won Namibia's independence elections.
   South African aid to UNITA formally stopped with the New York
accords, but Luanda recently renewed accusations that assistance
from Pretoria is still reaching the rebels. The rebels also receive
a reported $50 million in U.S. aid.
   Dos Santos struck a conciliatory note Thursday, praising de
Klerk as ``an advocate of peace in the region'' for allowing
Namibia to gain independence and for opening talks with the ANC.
   ``Peace should be brought to South Africa and to southern Africa
as a whole a soon as possible,'' said dos Santos.
   Security was heavy in Luanda with troops and military police
manning roadblocks at most major intersections.
   Western and African diplomats said the government could be
concerned that UNITA might try to stage guerrilla attacks during
Mandela's stay.
   Increased rebel sabotage and bomb attacks this year have left
Luandans nervous and dependent on emergency electricity and water
supplies.
   Mandela's arrival in Angola came one day after de Klerk started
a nine-nation European tour to gain international support for his
attempts to reform South Africa.
   De Klerk ordered Mandela's release from prison and legalized the
ANC in February, 30 years after the organization was banned.

   The preferential treatment the federal prison
system gets in selling products to the government is hurting the
nation's private industry, some members of Congress said Thursday.
   ``This is a playing field that is obviously not level,'' said
Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., sponsor of a bill to limit the prison
system's guaranteed share of the federal market.
   Coble said furniture and textile companies in North Carolina are
hurt by the burgeoning prison manufacturing program, which sold 240
different products to federal agencies last year. The sales totaled
$361 million and are expected to double by 1992. The program
employed 13,000 inmates and 1,400 civilians.
   The prisons sold $90 million worth of furniture in 1989, a 20
percent increase over the previous year, said Rep. Fred Upton,
R-Mich.
   Industry officials believe the prisons have 23 percent of the
federal office furniture market, he said.
   Federal agencies must now buy products from the prison system if
it can meet the purchaser's price and delivery requirements.
   Upton said the growing federal inmate population could make the
prison industries program the equivalent of a Fortune 500 company
by 1992.
   ``To me it seems inherently unfair that private industries must
compete for federal market share in this uncompetitive situation,''
he said.
   Upton and Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., testified at a hearing of
the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts, intellectual property
and the administration of justice. The panel is considering a bill
that would have the prisons compete equally with private companies
once the prisons obtain a 10 percent share of the federal market
for a given product.
   Aside from textiles and furniture, the prisons produce leather,
electronic, plastic, wood and metal goods, and graphic products.
   Federal Bureau of Prisons Commissioner J. Michael Quinlan spoke
against the measure at a Jan. 30 hearing, saying the manufacturing
program helps inmates learn job skills and defuses potential inmate
unrest from overcrowding.

<HEAD>Report: Southern Sudan Facing Acute Food Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Sudan, where tens of thousands
of people starved to death in previous years, once again faces an
acute food shortage, according to a report Thursday.
   The Sudan News Agency carried the report, written by the
government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in cooperation
with the United Nations and Western relief organizations.
   The report said that despite food shortages, there was no threat
of famine.
   But Western relief sources said there was an imminent threat of
starvation in northern parts of Bahr el-Ghazal and around Juba,
capital of Equatoria. They said in some areas malnutrition was high
among children under five years old.
   The report followed a two-week survey of the southern Sudanese
regions that have been battered by a 7-year-old civil war.
Christian and animist rebels in the south want autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum.
   The war led to food shortages that killed 250,000 Sudanese in
1988, U.N. figures show.
   The report did not indicate this year how many people were
affected by what it said was an ``acute food shortage.'' It called
for the transportation of food to the southern regions before the
summer rains, which begin in June.
   The United Nations has said 4.5 million southerners need
emergency relief this onth.
   Laughrun said he was hoping for probation for his client.
   ``We're going to ask for it and the government (prosecutors)
indicated they aren't going to fight us on that,'' he said. ``We
hope the judge will go along with it.''
   In the plea agreement, the court said the sentencing guidelines
called for a prison sentence of between eight and 14 months.
Fletcher had faced a maximum term of five years and a $250,000 fine.
   Fletcher, a regular guest on Bakker's old ``PTL Club''
television show, was indicted last December for lying to the grand
jury that investigated PTL's operations.
   Fletcher was accused of lying to the investigative panel in
September 1987 about why he brought Miss Hahn to Florida to meet
Bakker in 1980. He denied then that he took her to a hotel to have
sex with Bakker.
   Testifying later, however, he admitted that sex was the purpose
of the meeting, according to the indictment.
   The meeting ultimately led to the demise of the
multimillion-dollar televangelism empire run by Bakker and his
wife, Tammy Faye, in nearby Fort Mill, S.C.
   Bakker resigned as PTL chairman when it was about to be revealed
in March 1987 that PTL had paid Miss Hahn $265,000 in hush money.
PTL fell into bankruptcy and a federal grand jury began looking
into Bakker's fundraising activities and spending.
   Bakker went on trial last year on charges he defrauded his
followers who sent him $158 million in exchange for phony offers of
guaranteed lodging at the Heritage USA Christian retreat.
   In October, Bakker was convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy and sentenced to 45 years in prison. He is appealing the
conviction while he is serving his time at a Minnesota prison.
   Three other PTL associates _ former executive vice president
Richard Dortch and ex-Bakker aides David Taggart and James Taggart
_ are in prison for crimes they committed while working at the TV
ministry.
   Fletcher, 50, is free on $25,000 unsecured bond. Late last
month, he was released from the Butner Federal Correctional
Institution in northeast North Carolina, where he underwent a
court-ordered 45-day psychiatric evaluation.

<HEAD>Kaifu Seeks Radical Reform of Japan's Electoral System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Thursday urged a
radical revision of the electoral system, saying it is the only way
to reduce the power of money in Japanese politics.
   ``It is clear to me that the public wants clean,
easy-to-understand politics,'' Kaifu said in a nationally televised
news conference. ``I will bet the fate of my administration on
achieving this reform.''
   Kaifu endorsed the recommendations of an advisory council to
change Japan's system of multiple-seat constituencies, reduce
politicians' ability to raise money on their own, and tighten rules
on reporting political donations.
   ``Looking back on the `Recruit' influence-peddling scandal, it
is the central theme of my administration to clear political
distrust and shift elections from a race of individuals to one of
political parties,'' he said.
   Kaifu, 59, came to office in August after two predecessors
resigned in quick succession over the Recruit and sex scandals.
Recruit Co., a giant in the information industry, made lavish
donations and questionable stock sales to leading politicians,
businessmen and bureaucrats.
   Initially seen as a stop-gap prime minister because he lacked a
power base within the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Kaifu has
gained public support with his clean image and efforts to ease
U.S.-Japan trade friction.
   Analysts express skepticism, however, over the possibilities of
drastic electoral system reforms.
   ``While some politicians are aware that electoral reforms are
essential to wipe out money politics, it is too risky for most of
them to accept such drastic reforms,'' said Takashi Inoguchi, a
political science professor at Tokyo University.
   Kaifu said he would consult with the opposition parties to build
a consensus for introduction of an electoral reform bill by
November.
   Japan now has 130 constituencies for elections to the 512-seat
lower house. Most elect three to five legislators.
   To win a majority, the governing party must field more than one
candidate in each constituency.
   Candidates from the same party thus cannot compete on policy
issues, said Isao Sato, a law professor at Tokai University and
co-chairman of the Electoral Review Committee.
   ``They inevitably vie for popularity by spending lavishly to
court voters,'' Sato said. ``That not only leads to corrupt money
politics, but also reduces the significance of policy debates.''
   The committee, formed in June, proposes creating 300 single-seat
constituencies and having 200 members elected to nationwide,
at-large constituencies in the powerful lower house. The lower
house can override the upper house and enact legislation on its own.
   The lower house proposals would limit each candidate to having
two fund-raising groups _ now there is no limit _ and require the
reporting of donations more than $64. The current limit is $6,400.
   The governing party was seriously shaken by public outrage after
the Recruit scandal came to light in 1988.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and three Cabinet ministers were
forced to resign, and the Liberal Democrats lost upper house
elections last July for the first time in their 34-year history.
   Liberal Democrats gradually regained enough support by February
to win a comfortable majority in national elections for the lower
house.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Crop Forecast at 9-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter wheat production is rebounding after
last year's drought-reduced harvest in the Great Plains, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Based on field conditions as of May 1, production could be a
nine-year high of 2.09 billion bushels, up 44 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.45 billion bushels.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said the average
yield based on current indications was estimated at 41.1 bushels
per acre, compared with 35.1 bushels last year.
   In Kansas, for example, winter wheat production was estimated at
460.2 million bushels, more than double the shriveled 1989 harvest
of 213.6 million bushels. Both the acreage and average yield were
up.
   Overall, farmers are expected to have about 50.8 million acres
of winter wheat for harvest this year, up 23 percent from 41.5
million in 1989, the board said in its report.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year.
It accounts for about three-fourths of the U.S. total wheat
production. The remainder is planted in the spring.
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers, said the larger harvest will ``put us
in a stock-building mode'' for some time in the future. At least
until something can be done about worldwide capacity for producing
too much grain.
   Schwensen said the United States has ``made a real
accomplishment'' by putting millions of acres of marginal land in
the Conservation Reserve Program, which takes it out of crop
production for 10 years. He said around 11 million acres of that
land has come from nation's wheat base.
   ``No other major producing and exporting nation has even
attempted to take the initiatives that we've had _ to set aside
marginal lands specifically from wheat production,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   The USDA's first official estimate of 1990 production of all
wheat will be issued July 12, with the first estimates for corn,
soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops scheduled for
Aug. 9, along with revised figures for wheat.
   Although no official estimates based on field surveys were
included, except for winter wheat, department analysts in a related
supply-and-demand report did project ``highly tentative'' 1990
production of all wheat at more than 2.69 billion bushels, up from
less than 2.04 billion last year.
   Projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather
the remainder of the growing season.
   The 1990 corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels, up
from 7.53 billion harvested last year. Soybean production was
projected at 1.925 billion bushels, virtually the same as the crop
of 1.927 billion bushels in 1989.
   According to the supply-and-demand report, the U.S. wheat
stockpile will be drained to a 15-year low of 442 million bushels
on June 1, the beginning of the new wheat marketing year. But with
the expected larger 1990 harvest, the wheat stockpile could be
rebuilt to about 765 million bushels a year from now.
   The projected larger 1990 wheat harvest could put pressure on
market prices, which were indicated in the range of $2.90 to $3.30
per bushel in 1990-91, compared with an estimated $3.71 this season.
   If corn production turns out at the projected level of 8.1
billion bushels, it still wouldn't be quite enough to match
domestic and export demand, the report showed. Thus, the U.S. corn
stockpile, which may be around 1.33 billion bushels next fall,
could edge lower by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Corn prices were projected at $2.25 to $2.65 per bushel in
1990-91, compared with the current season's forecast of $2.30 to
$2.40 per bushel.
   Looking at the global situation, the analysis said prelminary
indications ``point to larger crops in a number of countries and
continued growth in use.'' World wheat production is expected to be
record large in 1990-91, the report said.

<HEAD>Company Says It Will Begin Tests of Wireless, Personal Phones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York company said Thursday it will begin
testing within two years a revolutionary, wireless ``personal''
telephone system in Houston and Orlando, Fla., designed to compete
with wired and cellular systems.
   The lightweight, wallet-sized phones will use high-frequency
microwave signals to connect telephones over short distances, such
as in office buildings or within neighborhoods.
   The new systems, known as personal communications networks,
could be connected with PCNs in other cities to provide nationwide
communications. PCN owners would need dial only a code to let the
system know where they are at any time, said J. Shelby Bryan,
chairman of Millicom Inc., a New York-based international cellular
company.
   Shelby said a Millicom subsidiary, PCN America Inc., will
conduct a two-year test of the system in the Texas and Florida
cities. The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved
the experiment.
   Company spokeswoman Andrea Van Raalte said the test would begin
sometime in the next two years.
   Officials at American Personal Communications Inc. earlier this
year received FCC permission to test a similar type of phone, but
which would be unable to receive calls, in the Washington area. The
company has said when it hopes to begin testing next year.
   Because of the short range of high-frequency microwave signals _
as little as 600 feet _ the PCN, unlike regular cellular service,
will be able to share space with other private microwave users.
   This feature greatly increases the system's capacity _ and its
attractiveness to businesses that may find PCNs more convenient to
use in an office building than wired systems.
   A large number of users in small areas would greatly lower the
cost of the phone units _ perhaps to $100 or less, Bryan said.
   ``We can basically have many more subscribers per network so our
cost per subscriber will be lower,'' Bryan said in a telephone
interview.
   Officials at American Personal Communications told The
Washington Post they hoped the phones ultimately would cost $50 to
$75.
   The phones also will use much less power than cellular ones, and
should have battery lives of up to a week, Bryan said.
   ``I fundamentally believe that PCNs are going to be the first
serious means of competition for local communications,'' an AT&amp;T
official, Richard B. Snyder, was quoted as saying in Thursday's
editions of The New York Times.
   Bryan commented:
   ``We'll always have copper (wire) communications, but I think
it's going to be viewed over time as kind of an old-fashioned
technology. ... I think we will be in direct competition to
cellular.''
   Cellular phones use a few large radio towers to transmit calls
across what are known as ``cells'' in a metropolitan area. The
equipment automatically passes off calls as a caller in an
automobile, for instance, passes from cell to cell.
   The PCN system will rely on refrigerator-sized, low-power
transmitters that will transmit across a more limited area. Like
existing cellular telephones, the new service will be able to
``pass off'' phone calls as users move from one transmitter area to
another.
   The British government already has selected three consortia to
build nationwide PCN systems in Britain. Millicom is one of the
consortia; service is expected to begin there by 1993.
   ``We envision that by the turn of the century ... 25 percent of
the population of England will be on some form of radio
telephone,'' Bryan said.

<HEAD>Urban Lawmakers Band Together To Oppose `Anti-Consumer' Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diverse group of House members said Thursday
they will present a united front against agriculture subsidy
programs that they consider anti-consumer in the 1990 farm bill.
   The group led by Reps. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., includes liberals and conservatives who have two
things in common. None is a member of the Agriculture Committee and
all believe government farm programs are too expensive.
   Schumer, of Brooklyn, said many House members have been
interested in change but haven't banded together before to give
each other support.
   This year, ``we're working together,'' said Schumer, though
acknowledging they weren't all interested in the same subsidy
programs. ``In general we have agreement that agriculture has
gotten out of control.''
   Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., said she opposed the wool
subsidies while Reps. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y. and John Porter,
R-Ill., spoke out against the sugar program.
   Others opposed the peanut program or any subsidy for farms with
annual profits over $100,000.
   Other congressman at a press conference to introduce the
coalition were Reps. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., Dana Rohrbacher,
R-Calif., and Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   Armey said Reps. George Miller, D-Calif., Thomas Carper, D-Del.,
Jim Bates, D-Calif., Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn. also were a part of the group.
   Schumer said that rather than work through the agriculture
committee, the coalition decided the best strategy was to amend the
farm bill on the floor.
   Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, has acknowledged
that the Armey-Schumer opposition to farm programs gained a lot of
attention and will have ``some effect on the members.''
   He indicated, however, that plenty of support existed in the
House for the work the agriculture committee is doing.
   De la Garza is not likely to send a bill to the floor that will
be drastically amended, said a committee staff member.
   Frank said the multi-billion dollar farm bill was ``one of the
last vestiges of the bad old days when differences were worked out
by adding money to the budget.''
   He said urban lawmakers traditionally voted for farm programs
without question in exchange for legislation they wanted for city
dwellers.
   Frank said the government should save its money and let the free
market regulate agriculture.
   He called the government programs ``anti-consumer, anti-taxpayer
and over-regulated.''
   Since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government
has enacted laws to regulate the food supply and assure farmers
certain prices for their crops. Every five years, Congress approves
a farm bill that determines the way and degree in which tax dollars
will be used to support farmers.
   Both the Senate and House agriculture committees have been
approving sections of the 1990 legislation for several weeks and
are cognizant of the demands for reduced government support.
   Intense negotiations are under way in each committee over the
programs that will regulate the big money crops of wheat, soybeans,
corn, rice and cotton.
   The Bush administration has said that support for those crops
must be limited to $10.2 billion fiscal 1991.

   A computerized analytical center to help
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies combat drug money
laundering and other financial crimes opened Thursday.
   ``The U.S. drug trade alone is estimated to be a $100 billion
per year business,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said at a
ceremony marking the inauguration of the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network.
   ``If we are ever going to be successful in getting drugs off the
streets of our cities, we must hit the business side by taking the
profit out of drug dealing,'' Brady said.
   The Treasury center will gather information from prosecutors and
police around the country and overseas, process it and try to
identify potential targets for investigation.
   Center employees also will conduct research on money laundering
and serve as a liaison between local, state and federal officials.
   ``Some have talked about turf problems,'' said William J.
Bennett, White House drug policy adviser. ``Here is another example
of turf cooperation, indeed turf harmony.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the paper trail that
investigators once followed has become the electronic trail.
   ``Drug dealers are ... making a lot of money and they're moving
that money through sophisticated and complicated financial channels
not only across state lines but across international boundaries,''
he said.
   ``We will be matching, effort for effort, the kind of
sophistication the drug lords are imparting into their
operations,'' Thornburgh said.

   Does George Bush hurt himself politically if
he breaks his campaign promise not to raise taxes? Nonsense, says
Richard Nixon.
   ``My view is, he sits down with the leaders of Congress; he gets
them to agree to cut spending, and as far as he is concerned he
will agree to some kind of tax compromise,'' Nixon said Thursday in
a television interview with Larry King on Cable News Network.
   ``First, if the Congress agrees to it, he doesn't have a problem
because they are all in it together. But if he doesn't get
agreement, he goes before the American people, he has enormous
popularity.
   ``The purpose of popularity is not to hoard it, it's to use it.
And he can use that popularity to bring the Congress along and let
these lily-livered people come along with them.''
   Nixon was asked how Bush can overcome his ``read-my-lips''
campaign stance against raising taxes.
   ``No problem at all,'' he said. ``He can say, `I believed at the
time, but the situation has changed and I'm dealing with it.'''

   The Senate brushed aside a threatened veto by
President Bush and voted Thursday to allow federal civil service
and postal workers to take a more active role in partisan politics.
   On a 67-30 vote after eight days of debate, the Senate approved
a wholesale revision of the 1939 Hatch Act, which prohibits 2.9
million government employees from participating in political
campaigns.
   The law would still prohibit federal workers from engaging in
political activities on the job and from running for public office
or soliciting campaign funds from the public.
   But they could in their off time hold office in local, state and
national political organizations, attend political conventions as
delegates and solicit campaign funds from co-workers on behalf of
candidates or federal employee union political action committees.
   Thirteen Republicans joined all 54 Senate Democrats in passing
the bill despite an intensive effort by the White House to prevent
it from garnering the 67 votes it would need to override a veto.
   ``Hopefully we can sustain a veto,'' Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas said before the vote. Congressional Democrats
have been unable to override any of Bush's 10 vetoes in his first
16 months in office.
   A year ago, the House passed by a veto-proof 297-90 vote a
broader bill that also would remove the prohibitions on running for
public office and soliciting campaign funds from the public.
   Bush's senior advisers have said they would urge him to veto any
change in the law as ``undermining the integrity and independence
of the traditionally non-partisan civil service.''
   The legislation was sought by federal employee and postal unions
after the Reagan administration filed Hatch Act charges against
three union presidents for endorsing Democrat Walter Mondale in the
1984 presidential election.
   Before the final vote, minority Republicans tried to continue
the current restrictions on employees of the IRS, intelligence
agencies, the Justice Department and the Federal Election
Commission.
   ``Certain critical agencies of this govrernment need to be
beyond political involvement ... (and) not have any taint of
politics or coercion,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.
   His amendment to exempt all employees of those agencies from the
looser restrictions on political involvement and also forbid all
government workers from soliciting co-workers for campaign funds
was defeated on a 58-39 vote.
   The Senate did adopt on a 97-0 vote an amendment by Dole that
would maintain the current restrictions on the 240 employees of the
Federal Election Commission.
   But Republicans failed in several attempts to delete language
from the bill that would allow federal workers to spend their off
time soliciting campaign gifts from co-workers on behalf of union
PACs.
   Dole called the provision a ``pot of gold'' for the Democratic
Party, citing statistics that 88 percent money raised and
distributed by federal employee and postal union PACs in the 1988
election went to Democrats.

   Soldiers on Thursday shot and killed a
Palestinian and wounded 20 other Arabs in the occupied Gaza Strip,
and Jewish settlers rampaged through the West Bank town of Hebron,
firing on homes and smashing cars.
   Also Thursday, Ziyad Al Rugeeby, 14, died of a head wound
suffered in a Wednesday clash with soldiers, Arab reporters said.
They said he was buried in his hometown of Hebron.
   In the Gaza Strip village of Beit Hanoun, soldiers opened fire
at stone-throwing Palestinians, striking Fayez Mohammed Hamad, 24,
in the back. He was pronounced dead at Gaza City's Ahli hospital,
officials said. The army confirmed the death.
   About 1,500 villagers later marched in Hamad's funeral
procession, which developed into a nationalist protest, Arab
reporters said. Troops in a helicopter and 30 vehicles monitored
the ceremony and fired into the crowd, wounding at least 20 people,
when confrontations broke out.
   Most of the wounded, including a teen-age girl, were shot in the
head, hospital officials said.
   The girl, who was not identified, was rushed to an Israeli
hospital in serious condition, Arab reports said. Under army
regulations, soldiers are ordered to fire at the legs of protesters
if violence is unavoidable.
   Israel radio described the confrontation as ``serious,'' but an
army spokesman confirmed only five of the wounded and said there
were no special circumstances concerning the clash.
   The two deaths Thursday raised to 685 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli gunfire in the 29-month-old uprising against
Israeli occupation. At least 212 Palestinians have been slain by
their Arab brethren as suspected collaborators, and 43 Israelis
have died in the violence.
   In Hebron, about 30 settlers from the nearby Jewish enclave of
Kiryat Arba rampaged through the town using clubs and stones to
smash the windshields of Arab-owned cars and firing their
army-issued guns at Palestinian homes, Arab reports and the
national Itim news agency reported.
   `They smashed the windows of five cars and fired for two hours.
Come and see how many bullets they shot at my house. My wife and
son were beaten,'' Issa Baradai, a Hebron resident, said in a
telephone interview.
   Arab reports said the rampage began after settlers were earlier
stoned by Palestinians.
   Hebron police said they were investigating the incident.
   Hebron has been the site of repeated clashes between its 70,000
Palestinian residents and the 200 settlers living in the town's
center and 5,000 Jewish settlers living in nearby Kiryat Arba.

   Orange harvest prospects are forecast at 179.2
million boxes, up 4 percent from last month but still 14 percent
below last season, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Most of the reduction from last year was attributed to declines
in the Florida and Texas harvests, which were hit by December
freezes.
   The Florida crop was estimated at 108.1 million boxes, compared
with 146.6 million in 1988-89. Texas production was indicated at
1.2 million boxes, down from 1.85 million in 1988-89.
   California production, estimated at 68 million boxes, is up from
58.8 million last season, while the Arizona harvest was indicated
at 1.9 million boxes, up from 1.7 million last season.
   Total grapefruit production was forecast at 48.4 million boxes,
down 30 percent from last year, reflecting the freeze in Florida
and Texas.

   Congressional Democrats reacted angrily
Thursday to a suggestion by Chief of Staff John Sununu that White
House negotiators would reject all tax-increase proposals at next
week's ``no preconditions'' budget summit.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disavowed Sununu's
remarks, saying they did not reflect Bush's views, but the chief of
staff was defended by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said any more such incidents could
``threaten the success of these talks,'' which are deemed of major
importance in the face of growing federal deficit problems.
   ``What John Sununu was saying was that the president doesn't
want to raise taxes,'' Quayle said in an interview with Cable
Network News. ``Sununu was just simply reflecting what the
president's instincts are, what his stated policies are.''
   For his part, Sununu said, in a brief comment, ``The point is
that the position is as it always has been: that `no preconditions'
means no preconditions. There is nothing that has to be in the
agreement and nothing excluded from the agreement.''
   Democrats reacted sharply to published accounts quoting a
``senior administration official,'' later identified as Sununu,
saying that Bush would stand fast to his previous ``no new taxes''
pledge during budget negotiations.
   The comments appeared to directly contradict earlier
administration assurances that there were ``no preconditions'' to
the high-level talks, to get under way Tuesday.
   Sununu's assertion ``raises the potential it's all a political
trap,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Fitzwater told reporters the official was not speaking for the
president in making such remarks.
   President Bush relayed the same message to Foley by telephone,
assuring him that nothing was off the bargaining table at the
budget summit, Fitzwater said.
   However, Congress' top Democrats held a news conference to
denounce Sununu's remarks.
   ``It is a question of trust, of whether or not agreements are to
be honored, of whether or not the administration is prepared to
negotiate in good faith on this important matter,'' said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, reading a statement
bearing the names of 11 Democratic congressional leaders.
   Foley, D-Wash., said, ``We view this incident as an extremely
serious one, because it could, if repeated, threaten the success of
these talks.''
   Bush's reaction to the report of Sununu's comments ``was that
there are no preconditions. He wanted me to reiterate that toyou
today,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Bush proposed the summit last Sunday to deal with a budget
deficit that administration and other analysts say could be about
to explode. Officials blame rising interest rates,
lower-than-expected revenues to the Treasury and a
higher-than-expected cost of the savings and loan bailout.
   White House officials say that without action the federal
deficit for fiscal 1991 could be up to $100 billion higher than the
$64 billion shortfall allowed by law, causing huge automatic cuts
in programs throughout the government.
   The official later identified as Sununu was quoted in The
Washington Post as saying: ``We're allowing them (Democrats) to
bring their good arguments for taxes to the table. ... They were
not persuasive last time and they are likely not to be persuasive
again.''
   ``But if they want to come to the table and say they put (tax
increases) there, it is their prerogative to put them on the table,
and it's our prerogative to say no. And I emphasize the no.''
   Asked about such an assertion, Fitzwater said: ``That's crazy.''
   But the remarks caused an uproar among Democrats already fearful
of being trapped by the administration into supporting an
election-year tax increase.
   Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., a member of the House Democratic
leadership, said: ``We feel we're setting ourselves up for a sucker
punch.''
   But Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, shrugged off the remarks and said he assumes
higher taxes will be part of the negotiations ``unless George Bush
says again `no new taxes.'''
   Speaking to the National Press Club, Rostenkowski said it was
Bush _ not Sununu _ who invited congressional leaders to negotiate,
``and that's encouraging.''
   Still, Rostenkowski said, ``I have no intention of moving on
taxes until the president does. I will not repeat the partisan
warfare that marked last year's budget debate.'' He referred to
Bush's unsuccessful effort to win a reduction in taxes on capital
gains.
   Panetta, the House Budget Committee chairman, said Bush himself
has to clearly state what the conditions for the talks are.
   ``The time has come to hear from the president,'' Panetta said.
   Fitzwater said: ``The president's position is clear. I am
stating it. It comes directly from him. We will not prejudge
anything that comes to the table'' in the budget talks.
   Asked how Democrats could believe the White House was
negotiating in good faith when he was saying one thing and Sununu
was quoted as saying the opposite, Fitzwater said: ``I speak for
the president. It's as simple as that.''
   Asked if Bush had reprimanded Sununu for the remarks, Fitzwater
declined to say, adding, ``There is no sense getting sidetracked on
these sorts of things.''
   Twenty Republican senators, led by Sen. Connie Mack of Florida,
have sent Bush a letter urging him to not renege on his ``read my
lips'' campaign promise against new taxes.
   ``He understands their position. He's had a very strong position
as well on taxes,'' Fitzwater said. ``But the fact is that he's got
to try to solve the deficit problem and he's got to try to keep the
economy growing and he wants to continue economic growth and that's
a bigger problem that requires some long term thinking and requires
the political courage to take leadership now.''

   Here is a summary of the 14 charges filed
against Mayor Marion Barry:
   _One misdemeanor count of conspiring to possess cocaine and
crack cocaine.
   The charge covers an unspecified number of incidents between the
fall of 1984 and Jan. 18, the night Barry was arrested in an FBI
sting operation. It carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail
and a fine of up to $100,000 upon conviction. The indictment was
handed up Thursday.
   _Ten misdemeanor counts of possessing cocaine, covering a period
from Nov. 7, 1987, until Jan. 18.
   Four of the possession charges result from a probe of Barry's
ties to convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis. Each possession charge
carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and up to a
$100,000 fine upon conviction. Five of the charges were filed Feb.
15 and five Thursday.
   _Three felony counts of perjury alleging Barry lied to a grand
jury.
   Barry is accused of lying when asked by the grand jury whether
he knew of Lewis' involvement with cocaine, if he ever gave drugs
to Lewis and if he received cocaine from Lewis. The perjury
charges, returned Feb. 15, each carry a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine.
   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be barred from holding
office or running for re-election.

   Residents of Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan residents traded
swimsuits and garden hoes for parkas and snow shovels Thursday as
freak storm brought back winter in May.
   The spring shocker was worst in Wisconsin, where snowfall up to
8 inches shattered records for late season snow.
   Some communities had to reassemble snowplows that had been
stored for the season. Residents who broke out the lawn furniture
and headed for the beach when tempeatures reached the 70s and 80s
just two days before dug their coats out of mothballs.
   ``We expect anything up here,'' said police Officer Ron
Michelson in Marquette, on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. ``It was up
in the 80s for a while and I had my lounge out. It's still sitting
on the porch getting full of snow.''
   The Wisconsin snowstorm, accompanied by sleet and wind up to 30
mph, was blamed for hundreds of accidents and two traffic deaths.
Powerlines downed by wind or accumulated ice caused temporary
blackouts in more than 40,000 homes.
   The storm was caused by a low-pressure system that sucked cold
air down from Canada and moisture up from the south, according to
the National Weather Service.
   Weather service specialist Edmond Lowe said the snowfall, while
not the latest in Wisconsin history, was a record for spring,
surpassing the 5 inches recorded April 30, 1907. The latest snow
ever to fall in spring in Wisconsin was May 31, 1889.
   In Hartford, a city of 7,000 about 30 miles northwest of
Milwaukee, Mayor Dean Kirley declared a state of emergency,
ordering residents off streets and advising businesses and schools
to close after 8 inches of snow fell.
   ``It's not safe to be outdoors,'' the mayor said.
   Several cities in southeastern Wisconsin reported snowfalls
deeper than 6 inches. Milwaukee recorded 2 inches, Madison 3 inches
and Green Bay 3 inches.
   In Michigan, a May record of 12.8 inches of snow fell at
Marquette County Airport. But in downtown Marquette, 800 feet lower
and close to Lake Superior, only about an inch fell.
   ``It's terrible,'' said Bernice Haapala in Herman, Mich., where
4 inches of wet snow covered the ground. ``My tulips were blooming
and all that kind of stuff. Now, that's why a person gets
depressed.''
   In Waukesha County west of Milwaukee, a near-blizzard during
morning rush hour resulted in up to 100 accidents, authorities
said. Some 2,500 bus riders were stranded when the service shut
down.
   Flights at Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport were
delayed as runways were closed several times so slush could be
cleared, said Greg Hetzel, assistant operations manager.
   In Washington County, Wis., snowplows and salting trucks were
hastily retrieved from storage and assembled.
   ``We're strictly playing catch-up,'' said Frank Scharrer, the
county highway commissioner.
   The misery dipped south into Illinois, where more than 4 inches
of snow fell Wednesday night and Thursday morning on Chicago's
northwest suburbs. Heavy rain brought out precautionary sandbagging
crews along the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers, and a tornado
toppled a silo in Virden, 20 miles south of Springfield.
   The storms eased in the afternoon, and were expected to move out
of the area overnight. But that wasn't the last of the late winter
_ clear skies mean temperatures can drop, and frost warnings were
posted overnight in many areas.
   ``We're having normal May weather _ whatever that is,'' said
weather service meteorologist Jack Cooley in Michigan. ``It's
normal for the weather to be abnormal.''

   The three separatist Baltic republics strengthened
their solidarity Thursday, implementing an agricultural agreement
that allows them to bypass Moscow and weighing a plan to coordinate
their government policies.
   Estonia proposed reviving a Council of Baltic States that was
created in 1934 when the republics were independent. It would
include the president, prime minister and foreign ministers of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, said Valle Feldman, a spokesman for
the Estonian Foreign Ministry.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel invited Presidents Vytautas
Landsbergis of Lithuania and Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia to sign an
agreement with him in Tallinn on Saturday. They did not respond
immediately.
   The three governments also implemented an agreement for the
direct exchange of agricultural supplies and products, bypassing
the central Soviet ministries and trade organizations that usually
handle such transactions, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   Last month, the republics signed a package of agreements to
integrate their economies, and the deals are being implemented in
stages.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev opposes immediate
independence for the Baltic republics, which were forcibly annexed
by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   The proposed Council of Baltic States would further integrate
the republics politically but would not constitute a confederation,
said Leivi Sher, spokesman for Estonia's Supreme Council, or
parliament. It could make non-binding recommendations on the three
governments.
   ``So far, it's just an Estonian proposal,'' he said, adding that
the parliament's executive committee approved the measure.
   It was unclear whether Latvia and Lithuania would agree to the
proposal. Lithuanian spokesmen said no agreement was likely before
the return to Vilnius next week of Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene. She was in Paris as part of a tour of Western
capitals.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters in Paris that Lithuanian
officials want to negotiate their independence with Moscow
according to a formula proposed by French President Francois
Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They suggested
that Lithuania temporarily suspend laws implementing the
declaration of independence enacted March 11.
   The establishment of direct agricultural exchanges and the
proposed Council of Baltic States signal a determination by the
three republics to overcome Kremlin opposition to their separatist
aspirations.
   The agricultural agreement, ``which entered into effect today,
provides that each of the three ministries must have permanent
representatives in the other Baltic republics, who will perform the
functions of coordinators and assistants in joint efforts to
resolve agricultural issues,'' Tass reported.
   Gorbachev imposed economic sanctions against Lithuania after the
republic declared its independence. On May 4, Latvia declared its
independence after an unspecified transition period, and Gorbachev
is studying that action, according to Latvian officials.
   On Tuesday, Estonia dropped the symbols of Soviet power,
changing its flag and name, invoked sections of the 1938
constitution that declared independence, and proclaimed solidarity
with Latvia and Lithuania.
   Gorbachev has not responded to the Estonian actions.
   His embargo of oil and natural gas has taken its toll in
Lithuania. Private automobile owners in Lithuania have been
restricted to about seven gallons of gasoline per month, and
rations for the month of May already have been exhausted, according
to the unofficial Postfactum Information Agency in Moscow. It said
rations might be reduced further in June as supplies dwindle
further.
   Also on Thursday:
   _Lithuania's Parliament formally took control of the republic's
radio and television. Under Soviet law, the broadcasting system
reported to both the Vilnius government and Moscow. However,
Lithuanians have effectively controlled their own broadcasting for
some time.
   Shortly after declaring independence, the republic ordered one
of the three Russian-language channels to switch to Polish
television for the benefit of the 7 percent of Lithuania's
population that is ethnically Polish.
   _Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar will meet Friday with
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov to discuss the spring military
draft. Most Estonian youths up for the draft took advantage of a
new Estonian law allowing them to perform alternative service at
home, to the fury of the Soviet military.
   The newsletter Interfax, an affiliate of Moscow Radio, reported
that 1,500 young men chose alternative service and only 800 signed
up at draft offices.

<TEXT>
   Congressional backers of a proposal to
standardize state product-liability laws charged Thursday that
consumer groups have tried to thwart the legislation through a
campaign to ``trash anybody who stands in their way.''
   The legislation, backed by the Bush administration and business
representatives, would create a uniform federal standard for
imposing punitive damages in lawsuits involving products that cause
death or serious injury.
   Consumer groups have said the bill would unduly limit people's
ability to collect for deaths and injuries that result from
industry negligence or irresponsibility.
   Backers of the legislation argue that variations in liability
laws from state to state offer potentially limitless damages and
hinder product development and American competitiveness.
   The accusations against consumer groups came as Linda Lipsen,
legislative counselor for Consumers Union, outlined what she said
were misrepresentations given at previous hearings by the Senate
Commerce Committee's consumer subcommittee into the safety of a
never-marketed substitute for asbestos that was manufactured by the
Missouri-based Monsanto Co.
   ``The administration and the manufacturing community have
asserted before you that the product liability system prevented a
totally safe substitute for asbestos _ calcium sodium metaphosphate
_ from being marketed,'' said Lipsen, beginning her testimony
before the panel.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., interrupted Lipsen, noting that she
had not included her comments about Monsanto or its product in the
21-page written testimony she submitted to the panel for review
before Thursday's hearing.
   ``I think you wanted to catch people unawares,'' said Danforth.
``It is a sneak attack. It is a sneaky, sneaky move on your part,''
he added to the applause of many spectators.
   Lipsen responded, ``It is not our normal course of business to
impugn, even indirectly, members of this administration or
witnesses before you.''
   Lipsen was speaking on behalf of four organizations _ CU, the
Consumer Federation of America, Public Citizen and the Public
Interest Research Group.
   The last two groups were founded by noted consumer advocate
Ralph Nader. Consumers Union is the nonprofit membership group that
publishes Consumer Reports magazine.
   Asbestos is a fire-retardant fiber that was used widely in
building construction until it was found to cause cancer.
   ``I think this is very typical of the Nader organizations ... to
trash people, trash politicians, trash businesses, trash anybody
who stands in their way,'' added Danforth.
   Nader, who was not present at the hearing, was again mentioned
by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who angrily noted an open letter
to him from the consumer advocate. The letter, which questioned
Rockefeller's integrity, was sent to newspapers in West Virginia.
   According to Rockefeller, Nader's letter asked, ``Why are you
spending your time huddled in Washington with corporate lobbyists,
many of whom finance your campaign, gambling with the lives and
safety of millions of people by taking away rights'' to seek relief
by supporting federal product liability law?
   Completing her statement, Lipsen told the panel it had not been
informed in previous testimony about a 1986 review by the
Environmental Protection Agency that said there was reason to
believe the asbestos substitute also could be carcinogenic.
   The bill would place a two-year limit on most product liability
claims, with the exception of a 25-year limit on workers' injury
claims.
   The measure also would allow separate trials or settlements of
damage claims when a suit involves more than one company. Firms
would pay damages in proportion of their responsibility for harm.
   The legislation would exempt from punitive damages manufacturers
whose products had received pre-market approval from the Food and
Drug Administration or the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Asked later about the charges levied by backers of the bill,
Nader dismissed the criticisms as ``a side show'' designed to
distract attention from key liability issues.
   ``These senators don't want to concentrate on explaining why
they are siding with the corporations that are producing deadly
toxic materials that are killing and injuring hundreds of thousands
of Americans a year,'' he said.
   ``Furthermore, they don't want to answer the question to
document the reason for their supporting this Wall Street
legislation with specific numbers,'' Nader added.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday sent President Bush a
bill authorizing the government's subsidy of Amtrak rail passenger
service through. The White House has threatened a veto.
   The House-Senate compromise, approved by voice vote, envisions
more than $2 billion in federal money going to the railroad over
the three-year period between last Oct. 1 and Sept. 30, 1992.
   The actual dollar amount will be determined as part of Congress'
annual appropriations process.
   Bush administration officials have said they would recommend a
veto of the bill because of the high cost, which it said amounts to
about $29 a passenger, and because of a provision which would
require Interstate Commerce Commission approval of railroad
takeovers by non-railroad companies.

<TEXT>
   The Croatian Democratic Union, a
center-right group advocating the republic's independence from the
rest of Yugoslavia, has won 196 of the 331 seats so far decided in
the region's first free elections, partial results showed Thursday.
   The state news agency Tanjug, announcing the latest results from
a second round of voting in the republic completed Monday, said 25
seats remain to be decided in the 356-seat, tricameral legislature.
   But the CDU already has a clear majority with 196 seats, versus
a total of 83 for the republic's reform communists and their allies.
   Figures for a third group, a coalition of centrist forces that
failed to make good on promising showings in pre-election polls,
were not given by Tanjug.
   Political observers expect the CDU landslide to exacerbate
Croatian tensions with the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics,
Serbia.
   The victory also is expected to increase pressure for Croatia
and Slovenia, the two wealthiest republics, to pull away from the
rest of the federation.
   Croatia and Slovenia are the only republics that so far have
held multiparty elections. In both, the ruling Communists were
defeated by center-right parties emphasizing national interests
over preservation of Yugoslavia's fragile federation.

   A $3 million study aimed at breaking the
grip of poverty on the Mississippi Delta aims to shift government
spending from welfare to creating jobs, a commission member said
Thursday.
   A report on the study, prepared during the past 18 months by the
Lower Mississippi Delta Commission, will be presented to Congress
on Monday.
   A summary of the report shows that the commission will offer
more than 400 recommendations that include establishing a regional
bank for loans to area businesses, improving highways and schools,
upgrading regional health care and attracting more tourists, The
Commercial Appeal reported Thursday.
   The commission's study area took in 219 counties in Illinois,
Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   The region, where 20.9 percent of the residents live below the
federal poverty level, is one of the poorest in the country and has
one of the highest rates for infant deaths.
   Former Rep. Ed Jones, a commission member from Tennessee, said
he doubted the report would have many immediate, practical effects
but its benefit over the long run could be substantial.
   ``(Congress) will slowly try to do something about it, but it
will take time,'' Jones said from his home in Yorkville. ``The
report is going to have to be researched by the committees that
prepare the laws for Congress. A lot of it will be knocked out, no
doubt about it.''
   Jones, a Democrat who represented rural northwestern Tennessee
for 29 years, said the report tries to refocus government spending
because commissioners know that new federal and state spending will
be hard to come by.
   ``There's no new money. We know that. But there's money that can
be redirected,'' he said. ``Thirty to 40 percent of the people in
the Delta region are on food stamps or some sort of welfare. If you
could reduce that by half, look at the amount of money you would
save.''
   The commission, financed by a $3 million appropriation from
Congress, is scheduled to disband Sept. 30, but the report suggests
that states in the region create a successor organization to work
as ``advocate for the Delta initiatives.''
   ``Not only must the federal government find new ways to invest
in the Lower Mississippi Delta's future, but other levels of
government, the private sector, civic and non-profit organizations
must step forward,'' the report's summary said.
   Among its recommendations, the report calls for: a regional
development bank and community-based loan pools using federal,
state and private funds; an agriculture center in Memphis to help
educate Delta farmers on the latest farm technology; the addition
of 400,000 housing units for low-income Delta residents by the year
2001; federal funding for magnet schools in each Delta state; a
residential high school specializing in math and science; and an
agency to promoting tourism throughout the region.
   Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., said lawmakers from the region have
formed the Lower Mississippi Delta Congressional Working Group to
press their colleagues to deal with the commission's report.
   ``We've got to get off to a fast start,'' Espy said. ``This is
the road map.''

   Americans took out $2.6 billion more in
consumer credit than they paid off in March as borrowing to buy
automobiles rebounded from February, the government said Thursday.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent, up from a scant 0.1
percent rise in February. That represented a sharp revision from
the 5.7 percent rate estimated earlier reported for February and
made the month the weakest in a year.
   Credit grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in January rather than
the earlier estimate of 6.4 percent, the Fed said.
   With the dampening of economic growth this year, consumers are
borrowing less. The first quarter annualized rate of 2.7 percent
compares with 7.6 percent for all of 1989 and 8.5 percent for 1988.
   Economist Sandra Shaber of The Futures Group, a Washington
consulting firm, said the economy has been expanding for so long,
7{ years, that consumers have less appetite for ``big ticket''
items that are purchased with loans.
   ``I think there also has been an erosion of consumer confidence.
... People are worried. ... They read in the paper that the
unemployment rate went up or that interest rates are going up.
People pay attention,'' she said.
   Automobile loans in March advanced $1.8 billion, a 7.5 percent
annual rate, after falling at a 5.2 percent rate in February and
advancing at only a 1.7 percent rate in January.
   Credit card debt rose by $2 billion, or a 12.1 percent annual
rate, in March, up from a 4.7 percent rate a month earlier.
   Bank, thrift and credit union loans not secured by real estate
were down $1.2 billion, a 7.2 percent rate, after climbing at a 3
percent rate in February.
   Borrowing for mobile homes rose $17 million, a scant 0.9 percent
annual rate, after rising at a 1.7 percent rate.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of March
at $721.5 billion.

<TEXT>
   At least 100,000 men, women and children
marched through downtown Algiers on Thursday to protest the rising
trend of Islamic fundamentalism in this North African nation.
   The protesters carried banners reading ``Yes to Dialogue'' and
``Islam and tolerance'' as they marched two miles in a drizzling
rain through the center of town.
   The so-called ``March of Democrats'' was organized by four of
the nation's 24 political parties and was staged as an answer to a
huge demonstration held three weeks ago by the Islamic Salvation
Front. The Front is expected to capture almost 30 percent of the
vote in June 12 municipal elections.
   Absent from Thursday's march were officials from the National
Liberation Front, the party that has ruled Algeria since its
independence from France in 1962.
   The protest was briefly interrupted twice by followers of the
Islamic Front who tried to enter the march while shouting
fundamentalist slogans.
   In a Thursday interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Premier Mouloud
Hamrouche said Algeria was ``in an apprentice phase of democracy.''
   ``We must permit all people to express themselves,'' he said.
   The June elections will be the first elections since opposition
parties were legalized in February 1989.

<HEAD>Administration Modifies Position On Double Hulled Oil Tankers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration dropped its opposition
to requiring double hulls on oil tankers Thursday, announcing
support for a bill to require them on new vessels.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner outlined the new
administration position, which calls for some exemptions to the
requirement, in a letter to a House-Senate conference committee
mulling over two versions of oil pollution legislation.
   Skinner previously opposed a House version of the bill that
would mandate double hulls on all tankers within 15 years and said
the administration preferred a Senate bill which gave the secretary
some discretion to require them on new vessels.
   The oil industry complained that the costly retrofitting of
existing tankers would take too many out of service.
   The legislation was prompted by concern over last year's Alaskan
oil spill from the single-hull Exxon Valdez, which ran into a rock
ledge in Prince William Sound.
   Opponents of mandatory double hulls have said the 10 million
gallon Exxon Valdez spill probably would have occurred anyway and
might even have been worse with a double hull because the ship
could have capsized and lost all its cargo instead of 10 percent of
it.
   The new proposal would apply to tankers flying the U.S. flag and
foreign tankers serving U.S. ports. Many foreign-flag tankers are
owned by U.S. oil companies who register their ships under the
flags of Panama, Liberia and other ``flags of convenience'' to
avoid U.S. safety and wage regulations. Trade between U.S. ports is
reserved to U.S.-flagged ships.
   ``The administration generally supports requiring double hulls
on new construction of oceangoing tank vessels,'' Skinner said,
noting that a National Academy of Sciences study concluded that
double hulls are safe and give better protection to the environment.
   ``We believe that existing single-skin, oceangoing tank vessels
should be phased out after they are 25 years old ... beginning in
the year 2000,'' Skinner said.
   He said this would give U.S. and foreign tank owners about 10
years to replace their older vessels.
   The administration would not object to exemptions for vessels
serving deepwater ports until 2015, he said, unless an
international standard for double hulls is adopted before then.
   Tank barges plying only the Great Lakes could also be exempted
until 2015, Skinner said.
   ``This deadline is reasonable yet would serve as a strong
encouragement to owners to build only double-hulled inland barges
and Great Lakes tank vessels,'' he said.
   Skinner said the new position was prompted by a compromise
proposal by senators on the conference committee.
   He said the administration would work with the committee to
write a bill that ``will afford the greatest protection to the
environment without disrupting oil supplies, sending American
refining jobs offshore or imposing unjustified burdens on the
American consumer.''

   Kilauea Volcano came to life again early
Thursday after a rest of just a few days, officials said.
   A bright red glow in the night sky over the east flank of
Kilauea signaled the resumption of the movement of molten rock at
the surface in the area, officials said.
   Civil defense spokesman Rick Agan had said that the glow
appeared to indicate that the Pu`u O`o vent in the east rift zone
began erupting.
   But Christina Heliker, a geologist at the U.S. Geological
Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said later that the glow
visible around that vent was from lava just below the surface that
was moving to a second vent two miles away, known as Kupaianaha.
   Scientists and civil defense officials planned to fly over the
rift zone later Thursday to determine the extent of the activity
and direction of any new flows, she said.
   ``A lot of glow usually means there are lava flows on the
surface,'' said Heliker.
   An earlier eruption at Pu`u O`o produced a lava flow that caused
considerable destruction in the Royal Gardens subdivision. The
Kupaianaha vent is the source of lava that destroyed more than 60
homes in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision during the past six weeks.
   The Kupaianaha vent shut down Monday but small amounts of lava
were continuing to drain from the eight-mile flow into the ocean
next to Harry K. Brown Park at Kalapana.
   A total of 139 homes have been destroyed by lava flows since the
original eruption began Jan. 3, 1983. Damage to public and private
property has been estimated at more than $60 million.

   Bankers complain their business would be hurt
under a plan to offer college loans directly through student aid
offices.
   Three large student aid organizations are joining to form
CollegeCredit, a new program designed to offer college students
one-stop shopping for assistance. It will help aid officers to more
easily package loans with other forms of assistance.
   The partners in the joint venture are:
   _the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), a
federally-chartered, shareholder-owned company that buys student
loans from lenders and collects the payments.
   _The College Board, a non-profit group which administers
financial aid for colleges and provides a common aid application
form.
   _the Teachers Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities
Fund, a large pension plan for college and private school employees.
   CollegeCredit plans to offer $150 million in loans through The
College Board starting in the 1990-91 school year. Teachers Annuity
is setting aside $50 million and other lenders will supply the
rest. Sallie Mae will buy the loans, replenishing the money
available for future loans. All three groups will earn fee income
in the process.
   Banks complain the program will skim off the cream of the
student loan market degree-granting institutions, leaving them
loans to trade school and community college students, which have a
higher default rate.
   ``This program would service the most profitable part of the
student loan market, leaving lenders with a higher concentration of
higher-risk, low-balance loans to students,'' said Joe Belew,
president of the Consumer Bankers Association, the trade group
fighting the program.
   ``This process will further drive lenders out of the loan
programs, ultimately denying thousands of low-income students
access to student loans,'' he said.
   Bankers tried unsuccessfully to get Sallie Mae to drop the
program. Now they're lobbying members of Congress and threatening
to sue the organization.
   By law, Sallie Mae cannot originate student loans _ only buy
them from others. CollegeCredit is a scheme to circumvent the
restriction, Belew said.
   However, Gisela Valandigham, a spokeswoman for Sallie Mae, said
the company is only providing the CollegeCredit venture with the
same sort of support and loan servicing assistance it already
provides to banks.
   She said Sallie Mae purchased $5 billion in student loans last
year, mostly from banks, and the CollegeCredit program is not large
enough to be a competitive threat.
   Aides to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Labor subcommittee on education, had expressed concern about
CollegeCredit. But, Pell said in a letter to The College Board that
his concerns had been eased after the program agreed to limit
1990-91 lending $150 million.

   A car dealer criticized by Jewish
organizations said Thursday he's reconsidering a sales program that
offers discounts aimed at Christians.
   ``I don't want to give up my program, but I don't like to step
on anybody's toes,'' said Freddye ``Action'' Jackson, part owner,
president and general manager of Brown Lincoln-Mercury.
   ``Hopefully we can come up with a program that satisfies
everybody,'' he said after his nine-month-old Christian Members
Buyers Plan was called discriminatory. The program offfers
discounts to Jews as well as Christians.
   Jackson said he intended to meet next week with his business
partners and separately with the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, which has called for an end to the discount program.
   The Washington Post on Thursday quoted William E. Schuling,
chairman of Mid-Atlantic Cars Inc. of which Brown Lincoln-Mercury
is the major dealership, as saying he and Jackson had agreed to end
the program.
   But Jackson said, ``I haven't made a decision on it at all.''
   Shuling told the newspaper: ``No one's perfect. Everybody makes
a mistake. Freddye is a preacher and a salesman. He meant no harm.''
   A woman in Schuling's office said Thursday he was unavailable
for comment.
   Jackson started the CMBP last August. But the uproar began
Wednesday, to Jackson's surprise, after a local newspaper reported
on the incentive program.
   ``Any time you talk about Christianity, people blow it out of
proportion, people take it negatively. I don't know why,'' he said
Wednesday.
   Jews may get the discounts because, said Jackson, they believe
in God. Jews are the only non-Christians who can participate in the
program.
   Jackson spoke by telephone Thursday to the Anti-Defamation
League's David Friedman and they agreed to meet early next week.
   Friedman said, ``Fundamentally, he does not see anything wrong
with the plan. He doesn't understand why it would be divisive or
potentially discriminatory.''
   Jackson, Friedman said, is ``a deeply committed person who sees
this as a way of returning to the church money he has made as a
businessman. But he also sees this as a business proposition. It's
been very successfl.''
   Friedman added: ``He's clearly not been sold on a number of the
concepts I presented to him.''
   Under Jackson's program, people who prove membership in a
Christian church or Jewish synagogue may buy upscale Lincoln
automobiles for $600 over cost to the dealer and Mercury cars at
$250 over cost.
   Ministers pay $400 over factory cost for a Lincoln and $150
extra for a Mercury. In addition, the dealership donates to the
church of the buyer's choice $100 for a Lincoln and $50 for a
Mercury.
   Friedman said the inclusion of Jews ``doesn't change things one
bit.''
   ``The central point is that the customer should never have in
the back of his mind the message that you're going to receive
better or worse treatment because of the color of your skin, your
sex or your religion,'' Friedman argued.
   Jackson, who said he became deeply religious, recalled that
shortly after taking over the dealership last July, he prayed for
``a way of giving ... something from the dealership.''
   He said he donates 10 percent of his personal income to the
Shiloh Baptist Church in Landover, Md.
   Jackson said the CMBP was never intended to discriminate against
anyone, likening it to incentives for military personnel, members
of auto associations or employees of certain companies.
   ``If you're not a member of a buyer's plan, you can still get
the same discount. You just have to negotiate,'' he said.
   Ford Motor Co., which builds Lincolns and Mercurys, is staying
clear of the matter.
   ``The company knows about it. But Freddye Jackson is an
independent businessman,'' John Spelich, a spokesman for
Lincoln-Mercury in Detroit, said Wednesday.
   ``Ford Motor Co. has not and would not structure any of its
consumer incentive programs in this nature, but we don't address
those sort of things in our franchise agreement with our dealers,''
Spelich said.
   An Alexandria, Va., attorney has said he filed a Federal Trade
Commission complaint against Brown Lincoln-Mercury. FTC spokeswoman
Brenda Mack said she could neither confirm nor deny that the agency
had received it.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh invited
Mexican authorities Thursday to deliver more suspects accused of
participating in the 1985 kidnapping and murder of an American drug
agent.
   The attorney general defended the actions of Drug Enforcement
Administration agents who last month arrested a Mexican doctor
wanted in the case after he was whisked across the border to El
Paso, Texas, in an operation the Mexican government has bitterly
criticized.
   Thornburgh said the delivery of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain
into U.S. custody was ``initiated by high-ranking Mexican police
officials'' who offered to help the United States arrest those
accused of kidnapping and killing DEA agent Enrique Camarena.
   ``If they want to turn over more of the defendants who are
awaiting trial in this case _ I think it's probably unlikely _ we
would certainly receive them and bring them to trial,'' the
attorney general said.
   Asked if he had any objection to a repeat of the operation that
brought Alvarez to U.S. custody, Thornburgh said that ``we're not
dictators to how law enforcement operations'' take place in foreign
countries.
   ``So long as there is no conduct outside of this country by
other persons that shocks the conscience of the court, how a person
gets here within our jurisdiction is not a material concern,''
Thornburgh said, alluding to U.S. court decisions that uphold the
kidnapping of fugitives in foreign countries.
   ``Whatever actions that are carried out by Mexican authorities
in Mexico are of no moment to us,'' Thornburgh said.
   Fourteen other suspects wanted in connection with the slaying,
including two former high-ranking Mexican law enforcement
officials, are still in Mexico. The Mexican government has a
longstanding practice of not extraditing Mexicans to this country.
   Alvarez's defense lawyer has alleged that the Guadalajara
gynecologist was kidnapped at gunpoint by four armed men and flown
to Texas aboard a private airplane.
   The Mexican government, which accused U.S. authorities of
violating Mexico's sovereignty, demanded an explanation of the
DEA's role in the arrest. Six people have been arrested in Mexico
in connection with the kidnapping of Alvarez, who is awaiting trial
in Los Angeles.
   Mexico has also demanded the extradition of Antonio Garate
Bustamante, a former Mexican police officer living in Los Angeles
who told the Los Angeles Times that he directed the operation.
   Thornburgh said he ordered DEA to investigate the circumstances
of the arrest to counter Alvarez's claims that he was unlawfully
arrested by U.S. authorities.
   The attorney general, who met last week with Mexican
authorities, said, ``In an era of increased cooperation, it's my
view that our people regarded this in good faith as another example
of the type of cooperation that was being extended. And it's not
unique.''
   Thornburgh reiterated that ``no Drug Enforcement Administration
agents were involved in bringing ... (Alvarez) to the United
States. The first contact that DEA had with him was when they took
him into custody'' in El Paso.
   The attorney general said there was no evidence ``at this time''
that DEA agents violated any regulations and therfore he had no
plans to discipline anyone involved in Alvarez's arrest.
   Discussing the subject during a breakfast interview, he said,
``I place the integrity and the value of the life of American
citizens No. 1.''
   ``This case has to do with the prosecution of Dr. Alvarez
Machain, an individual who is charged with ... using his medical
skills to keep alive an American citizen who was being tortured so
that he could be tortured some more,'' Thornburgh said.

<HEAD>Winter Revisits Great Lakes; Rain Douses East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter revisited the Great Lakes on Thursday, bringing record
spring snowfall, while rain pelted much of the East.
   Flooding continued to bedevil some residents of Texas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas and Louisiana.
   A late storm that began Wednesday night and continued into
Thursday dumped wet snow on Wisconsin, Michigan and parts of
Illinois.
   Snow accumulations ranged from a trace in central Illinois to
four inches in Chicago's northwest suburbs to over a foot in some
high points on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Eight inches piled up in
Michigan's Marquette, Negaunee and Ishpeming counties, and 12.8
inches fell at Marquette's airport.
   Overnight snowfall across eastern Wisconsin ranged from half an
inch to nearly four inches. Three inches fell at Green Bay, Wis.
   Advisories for frost and freezing temperatures have been posted
Thursday night across western and northern Michigan and much of
Wisconsin.
   South of the late-season snowbelt, there were thunderstorms
scattered from southern Michigan and Wisconsin, across Illinois and
Indiana into Kentucky.
   In the East, scattered showers were reported from southern
Florida through New England.
   Marble-sized hail fell near Carbondale, Ill, and there was local
flooding elsewhere in the state and in Wisconsin.
   A flood warning was in effect over the Sabine and Neches river
basins in eastern Texas, the Brazos river in northern and central
Texas and the Trinity river in northern and southeast Texas. Also
flooding was the Red River, which forms the Texas-Oklahoma line and
flows into Arkansas.
   Flood warnings were posted for the Louisiana's Atchafalaya and
Black rivers and the Mississippi in Louisiana.
   On Friday, showers were predicted from Montana to Louisiana,
with thunderstorms possible over parts of Nebraska, Kansas and
Colorado. Showers also were forecast for northern New England, and
the rest of the nation was expected to get fair or partly cloudy
skies.
   During the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT, heavier rainfall
included 1{ inches at Camp Springs, Md., more than an inch at Fort
Belvoir, Va., and New Bern, N.C., and Richmond, Va., and almost an
inch at National Airport in Washington, D.C.
   In Valdez, Alaska, 9 inches of snow were on the ground Thursday
morning, the latest installment in a record-breaking season. Since
Oct. 23, 560.2 inches have fallen at Valdez, breaking the recored
of 517 inches set in the winter of 1928-29.
   Low temperature records were broken in Casper, Wyo., 20 degrees,
and Rapid City, S.D., 24.
   The low temperature in the lower 48 states was 10 degrees at
Pinedale, Wyo.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Chiefs Agree: Less Need for Battlefield Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with quotes from Cheney, Woerner,
final statement, details. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANANASKIS, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and other NATO military chiefs agreed Thursday that battlefield
nuclear weapons will be less important in a changing Europe, but
failed to back a Dutch call for a quick pullout of such arms.
   The officials repeatedly emphasized that NATO would continue to
need nuclear weapons in its arsenal.
   ``We think there will be no denuclearization of Europe,'' West
Germany's defense chief, Gerhard Stoltenberg, told German reporters.
   Cheney said the alliance may decide after careful study to make
unilateral cuts in nuclear-tipped artillery shells, mostly based in
West Germany.
   ``That's entirely possible,'' he told a news conference at the
end of two days of talks by NATO's Nuclear Planning Group talks in
the Kananaskis area, about 50 miles west of Calgary in the Canadian
Rockies.
   ``There's no need today to make that decision. We did not make a
decision here.''
   Dutch Defense Minister Relus ter Beek had urged his fellow
ministers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to eliminate
those weapons and challenge the Soviet Union to follow suit.
Stoltenberg, whose country is home to most of the alliance's
nuclear forces, supported him.
   With East-West tensions easing, NATO diplomats increasingly
believe they can safely cut back on both the artillery shells and
short-range nuclear missiles. The land-based weapons are deployed
to hit targets in East European countries, now no longer
adversaries.
   In their final statement, the ministers said, ``We agreed that
there is a diminishing need for nuclear systems of the shortest
range.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner reported ``clear
agreement to reduce or even ... eliminate'' nuclear artillery.
   But he said a decision would be made only after a detailed study
on the role nuclear weapons should play in the future.
   The ministers welcomed President Bush's decision last week to
cancel plans to develop a more powerful version of the Lance
surface-to-surface missile and modernize 155mm artillery shells.
   They supported his call for early negotiations between the
United States and the Soviet Union on trimming their stockpiles of
short-range nuclear missiles.
   NATO agreed last spring to start bargaining, but only after both
sides agreed on an accord to slash tanks, artillery, troops and
other non-nuclear forces in Europe, and began implementing that
accord.
   Bush said last week he would be willing to speed up the
timetable so nuclear negotiations could start as soon as an
agreement was signed. Negotiators for NATO and the Warsaw Pact are
pushing to wrap up a deal this fall.
   Woerner said Bush and other NATO leaders will set out objectives
for the negotiations at a summit, which he announced will be held
July 5-6 in London.
   The alliance has a limited arsenal of land-based nuclear weapons.
   There are 88 Lance launchers, with some 700 nuclear warheads,
according to analysts. The missile, expected to be obsolete in
1995, has a maximum range of about 75 miles.
   The Warsaw Pact has a 12-to-1 advantage in short-range
launchers, according to NATO estimates.
   The West has about 1,500 nuclear artillery shells. There are no
estimates on the Soviet arsenal, although analysts say the Kremlin
has tended to rely more on missiles than on artillery.
   The defense ministers urged Moscow ``to carry out substantial
reductions'' in theater nuclear missiles.
   Under the planning, NATO would rely more on air-launched nuclear
weapons. The United States is developing a tactical air-to-surface
missile, known as the TASM, to replace gravity bombs. It would be
launched from fighter aircraft capable of firing both conventional
and nuclear weapons.
   Woerner said the TASM, likely to be highly controversial in
Western Europe, was not discussed at this meeting.
   But he said dual-capable aircraft ``will acquire greater
importance as shorter range systems are phased out without
replacement.''
   Britain's defense chief, Tom King, said the alliance must make
sure its nuclear deterrence ``is credible, which means it's got to
work, which means that if necessary it has to be modernized.''
   The ministers hold nuclear strategy sessions twice a year.
   All 16 nations, except France, attend the sessions. France is
not part of NATO's joint military command. Iceland, which has no
armed forces, attends as an observer.

<HEAD>Iraq Insists U.S. Capacitors Were Imported Legally</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Saddam on 2nd reference is correct</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Thursday repeated its claim that
it legally imported electronic capacitors from the United States
for a university project. American officials say the devices can be
used as nuclear bomb triggers.
   A spokesman for Iraq's Foreign Ministry said some of the
capacitors displayed by President Saddam Hussein during a Tuesday
speech were ``imported from the United States in 1988 by the
University of Technology in a legal manner and in conformity with
U.S. regulations.''
   The anonymous spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi News
Agency in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus, said the capacitors were
imported solely for scientific research.
   The State Department said Wednesday it was asking Iraq for
``urgent clarification'' of Saddam's earlier claim that his country
had acquired the devices.
   ``We are certainly interested in knowing where these capacitors
came from and what their (Iraq's) intentions are,'' said Richard
Boucher, State Department's deputy spokesman.
   ``We have not authorized the sale to Iraq of any capacitors that
would be useful in a nuclear military program,'' Boucher said,
adding that the export of such devices to Iraq would violate U.S.
law.
   He said the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Gillespie, ``has
asked for urgent clarification of (Saddam) Hussein's comments.''
   Saddam asserted on Tuesday that Iraq circumvented a U.S. export
ban to obtain the devices, and that scientists at the Ministry of
Industry and Military Industrialization had succeeded in producing
two similar devices.
   The Iraqi president denied, however, that the devices were
intended as nuclear triggers. He said they are electrical
capacitors for use in research.
   Saddam said the Iraqi-made devices were completed in March, five
days after British authorities seized a consignment of 40 U.S.-made
capacitors at Heathrow airport near London.

killing 38 people and injuring 23, an official said.
   Fire department spokeswoman Carolina de Leon said the bus was on
its way from the capital to Antigua when the driver made a sharp

an embankment, 25 miles west of the capital, she said.
   The fire department and Red Cross workers said the dead were not

   Three Frenchmen and three Congo residents taken
hostage by rebels last month near the Congo-Angola border have been
freed, the foreign ministry said Thursday.
   The six, and a French colleague freed earlier this week, were
part of an oil exploration team working in the Congo near the
Angolan enclave of Cabinda. The oil-rich region is separated from
the rest of Angola by a strip of Zaire along its southern border,
and is bordered by the Congo on the north.
   The hostages were captured April 27 by rebels seeking
independence for Cabinda. The Frenchmen were being taken to Zaire's
capital, Kinshasa, to be flown back to France, the ministry said.
   The ministry said the French were in good health, and expressed
thanks to Zairean authorities for helping obtain their release. No
details were given about any negotiations.

   The first child witness in the retrial of the
McMartin Pre-School molestation case tearfully resisted testifying
Thursday, but she was persuaded by prosecutors and her parents to
go on.
   The 11-year-old girl then pleaded memory lapses and ended her
testimony on an inconclusive note, saying she couldn't remember if
she was sexually assaulted by defendant Raymond Buckey when she
attended nursery school.
   ``I don't remember if it happened or not,'' she said when asked
if Buckey touched her sexually.
   To the final cross-examination question about whether she was
sodomized, she answered, ``I don't remember.''
   The first McMartin Pre-School trial, the longest and costliest
criminal proceeding in U.S. history, ended in January when Buckey
was acquitted of 40 counts of molestation at the family-owned
school in Manhattan Beach. His mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was
acquitted of 12 charges.
   The jury, however, deadlocked on 13 counts against Raymond
Buckey, and the district attorney decided to retry him on eight of
those charges involving three children.
   The girl who testified Thursday did not appear at the first
trial, and the jury deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal on the charges
which involved her.
   The child witness offered one answer that seemed to conflict
with her earlier testimony that Buckey neither raped nor sodomized
her.
   The response came after a prosecutor read from grand jury and
preliminary hearing transcripts of testimony offered by the girl
six years ago.
   ``I don't recall but I remember it did happen,'' the girl said
when asked whether she was sexually hurt by Buckey.
   The prosecutor asked no further questions to clarify the answer.
   Deputy District Attorney Pam Ferrero read sections of the
transcript of a 1984 hearing in which the girl used anatomically
explicit dolls to show that she had been raped and sodomized.
   The youngster said repeatedly she couldn't remember giving any
of that testimony nor whether any of the events related happened.
It was only at the end of the long series of readings that she
appeared to change her mind.
   During questioning by Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, she said
she also didn't remember testifying that she was taken to a farm
where she saw a pig killed with a knife.
   ``I can't remember,'' she said.
   ``A pig killed with a knife would be pretty important to you?''
asked Davis.
   ``Yes,'' responded the girl.
   ``Knowing yourself, would that be something you would forget?''
he asked.
   ``I really can't remember that,'' she said.
   Nor could she remember that in 1984 she described a woman
teacher as lying on top of her nude and women teachers playing
``naked games.''
   ``I can't remember,'' she answered repeatedly.
   Charges against five women teachers, stemming in part from those
allegations, were dismissed after the preliminary hearing for lack
of evidence.
   Ms. Ferrero told Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg that the
girl's parents called her Wednesday night saying the child was
``extremely reluctant'' to return for more questioning. But the
parents agreed to bring her anyway.
   Ms. Ferrero said the girl expressed the same desire not to
testify when she arrived at court but ``was trying to be cheerful''
and agreed to cooperate.
   As Buckey's attorney began asking intimate questions about her
body, she suddenly announced, ``May I be excused? I have a stomach
ache.''
   Minutes later she was observed in the hallway sobbing in her
father's arms as he tried to comfort her.
   After and hour's recess, the child returned to the witness
stand. Her father was allowed to stand next to her and she clutched
a large stuffed toy snake. But during her testimony, the father
developed a nosebleed and had to leave.
   ``Oh God!'' the girl exclaimed as he left. Her mother replaced
him standing next to the girl for the balance of her testimony.

<TEXT>
   U.S. broadcast magnate Ted Turner said Thursday
that the Chinese government felt forced to call in troops last year
to put an end to a massive, pro-democracy movement.
   He also remarked that the hudnreds of thousands of students who
occupied central Beijing's Tiananmen Square for weeks ``were
breaking the law.''
   Turner, owner of the Cable News Network, criticized the United
States in a speech to foreign journalists for what he said was U.S.
interference in the affairs of other nations.
   ``The thing that drives me most crazy and makes me most
embarrassed is the fact that our leaders feel they have the right
to interfere in the affairs of other countries and tell them what
to do,'' he said.
   ``I personally don't feel that's done a bit of good.''
   Turner was asked what he felt the U.S. response should have been
to China's violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators on June
3-4, which left hundreds dead and thousands wounded in the streets.
   After the crackdown, the United States banned high-level
contacts, imposed economic sanctions, allowed Chinese students in
the United States to overstay their visas and criticized China for
human rights abuses. Beijing has repeatedly accused Washington of
``interfering in China's internal affairs.''
   Turner said, ``Whatever we are trying to accomplish, we would
accomplish more by saying that a tragedy occurred (and that) we
bleed for the students as well as for those in government and the
soldiers who felt forced to take that action.
   ``You catch more flies with honey.''
   Turner's CNN played an important role in showing the world the
events of last spring, when masses of students, intellectuals and
workers took to the streets every day for seven weeks demanding
political reforms and an end to corruption in government.
   When the army was called in, world viewers watched TV film of
bloodied victims being rushed to hospitals on flatbed tricycles,
columns of army tanks on Beijing's Changan Avenue and a tank, set
afire by furious students, blazing in the shadow of the Goddess of
Democracy, erected in the square days before.
   Turner is in Beijing for a meeting of the Better World Society,
a Washington-based group of which he is founder and chairman.
   On Friday, Turner and the society's board of directors are to
meet with Premier Li Peng, a conservative who supported the army
crackdown.

<HEAD>Novelist Walker Percy Dies At 74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walker Percy, whose deeply humane novels
and essays made him a unique voice in American letters, died of
cancer Thursday at his home. He would have been 75 on Monday.
   Percy's first novel, ``The Moviegoer,'' won him the National
Book Award in 1962 and set the themes that would occupy him for his
entire career: modern malaise in the New South and the tenuous,
often outlandishly comic, hope for human connection.
   His best friend and fellow author Shelby Foote was in Covington
at the time of Percy's death at his home here on the banks of the
Bogue Falaya river, across Lake Pontchatrain from New Orleans.
   In Jackson, Miss., author Eudora Welty said, ``I'm very grieved
and very, very hurt for all his family. His friendship meant a lot
to me and his work meant a great deal to me, too.''
   Services will be Saturday at St. Joseph's Abbey near Covington.
   After ``Moviegoer,'' Percy's novels included ``The Last
Gentleman'' (1966), ``Love in the Ruins'' (1971), ``Lancelot''
(1977), ``The Second Coming'' (1980), and ``The Thanatos Syndrome''
(1987).
   Once described by critic Alfred Kazin as ``the satiric
Dostoyevsky of the bayou,'' Percy claimed to have been influenced
more by the European existentialists, especially Kierkegaard, than
by fellow Southerners. He peddled his 1983 ``Lost in the Cosmos''
as ``the last self-help book'' and set out to ``explain why it is
that man is the only alien creature, as far as we know, in the
entire planet.''
   His other major piece of non-fiction was ``The Message in the
Bottle'' (1975), essays on the philosophy of language.
   Percy revealed his thoughts in the mid-50's as he contemplated
his future after two failed novels: ``It crossed my mind, what if I
did something that American writers never do, which seems to be the
custom in France: Namely, that when someone writes about ideas,
they can translate the same ideas to fiction and plays. ... So it
just occurred to me, why not take these ideas I'd been trying to
write about, in psychiatry and philosophy, and translate them into
a fictional setting in New Orleans, where I was living.''
   All six of his novels send upper-middle-class Southern heroes
out in hot pursuit of those ideas.
   Born in Birmingham, Ala., Percy was 11 when his lawyer father
killed himself. Two years later, his mother was killed in an
automobile accident. He and his two brothers went to Greenville,
Miss., to live with ``Uncle Will'' _ William Alexander Percy, his
father's cousin.
   Uncle Will was the author of ``Lanterns on the Levee,'' the
classic treatise on the best of the Old South. A famed World War I
infantry officer, poet, politician, lawyer, and planter, he
presided over a bachelor household that was a teeming crossroads of
Southern culture. It was ``visited regularly by other poets,
politicians, psychiatrists, sociologists, black preachers, folk
singers, itinerant harmonica players,'' Percy has written. The
young ward found him ``the most extraordinary man I have ever
known.''
   Percy graduated from University of North Carolina in chemistry
and got a medical degree from Columbia University in 1941. The next
year, working as a pathologist at Bellevue Hospital in New York
City, he caught pulmonary tuberculosis while performing autopsies
on derelicts.
   ``I've often said that getting a light case of TB was the best
thing that could've happened to me. It gave me a period of enforced
idleness,'' said Percy, who spent his three years of recovery
reading voraciously.
   By the time he was well, he had turned to a life of writing.
Inheritance allowed him to move to New Orleans and marry. He
converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1950, he settled in Covington
with Uncle Will's desk in his study. He raised two daughters and
became a grandfather.
   Between his recovery and the publication of ``The Moviegoer''
are 20 years that Percy joked about not remembering what he did
with.
   During those apprentice years, he wrote two failed novels and
numerous articles on language and psychiatry _ ``I felt more at
home on the psychiatric ward than anywhere else ... maybe it takes
one to know one.''
   Both his religious conversion and three years of Freudian
psychoanalysis during medical school played an integral role in his
writing. One book's subtitle is ``the adventures of a bad Catholic
at a time near the end of the world.'' Percy won the prestigious
Campion Award in 1986 from the Catholic Book Club despite
downplaying the role of the Church in his work.
   He insisted he was not a Catholic writer except that his writing
is informed by the Judeo-Christian view of man: ``But that's about
it.''
   Named by Pope John Paul II as the only American on the
Pontifical Council for Culture, Percy said, ``I understand it only
requires one trip a year to Rome. I do well just to get to New
Orleans.''
   The seclusion of Covington served him well. He often gave credit
to his ``original Presbyterian work ethic'' for the discipline and
steadiness he brought to his work. Mornings by the bayou he wrote,
left-handed, in a three-ring binder. Afternoons, he often typed
what he'd written. He said he had no terrors, he had no writer's
block.
   But he found it hard work. He could describe the maddening
frustration. He claimed no secrets or solutions. He told one
interviewer, ``It's a question of being so pitiful God takes pity
on you, looks down and says, `He's done for. Let's let him have a
couple of good sentences.'
   ``It's a strange, abject, little-understood profession.''
   He is survived by his wife Mary Bernice, two daughters Mary
Pratt and Ann Boyd and four grandsons.

<HEAD>Canadian Police Seize Drugs On Mohawk Reservation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian police seized
about $800,000 in drugs and cash on strife-torn Mohawk territory
Thursday, and some Indians complained of rampant drug smuggling by
the reservation's gambling supporters.
   Authorities said, however, that the raid was not connected to a
violence-filled struggle over gambling rights on the reservation.
   About 100 officers led by Ontario Provincial Police seized the
cocaine and marijuana from homes at Cornwall Island on the St.
Regis Indian Reservation and in nearby Cornwall, Ontario, said OPP
spokesman Peter West.
   The four pounds of cocaine and about a half-pound of marijuana
was worth nearly $1 million in Canadian dollars, or $800,000 in
U.S. dollars, West said.
   He said 21 people were charged with drug and weapons counts
under Canadian law, while 16 more were being sought. Police said
about half of the suspects lived on the reservation, which
straddles the U.S.-Canadian border.
   The 6 a.m. raid came after a 14-month undercover investigation
by Ontario and Quebec police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
New York state troopers, West said.
   Twelve guns were seized, including at least three automatic
rifles. Police also seized about $32,000 cash in U.S. dollars.
   Reservation violence had been quelled since hundreds of New York
and Canadian police swarmed onto the Mohawk land May 1, when two
Indians were shot to death in a 10-month-old casino gambling feud.
   The calm and the heavy police presence gave authorities the
opportunity to make the arrests safely, West said.
   ``We figured it was better to do it now, rather than waiting for
it to quiet down and us pulling our people off,'' he said. ``We
figured we had the resources there now.''
   Mohawks who resent the police presence said authorities used
excessive force in making the arrests.
   Pat Martin, who runs a clothing store on the reservation, said
police went to her daughter's and niece's homes by mistake.
   ``My niece is all bruised up,'' Martin said. ``They got her up
out of bed and made her run outside in just her nighty.''
   Broken glass was strewn around the living room at the home of
Elvis Thompson, where police smashed the door to arrest him, said
Thompson's girlfriend, Amanda Adams.
   Police ``said they knocked, but we got up and didn't get halfway
to the door before they broke it down,'' Adams said.
   Three of Thompson's brothers and two cousins also were arrested,
she said.
   Some tribal leaders say drug smuggling is widespread among
gambling supporters on the 28,000-acre reservation, where eight
casinos and bingo halls operate on the U.S. side. All but one of
the gambling halls has been closed since police took over the
reservation.
   Harold Tarbell, head chief of the tribal council that governs
the U.S. side of the reservation, said drugs, prostitution and
other crime associated with gambling is rampant.
   ``We need the support of outside police forces to remove the
criminal element'' from the reservation, Tarbell said in a
statement after the raid.
   Tarbell, who opposes gambling, and the other two U.S. chiefs
Wednesday asked Gov. Mario Cuomo to leave state police on the
reservation until a reservation police force can be created to
patrol the U.S. sector.
   Gambling supporters call the police an invading army that is
violating the reservation's sovereignty.

   A study indicating there are nearly 2.2
million hard-core cocaine addicts in the United States proves the
administration has adopted the wrong strategy in the drug war, the
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Thursday.
   ``This news is as alarming as it is tragic,'' Sen. Joseph R.
Biden, D-Del., said at a news conference.
   Biden released a report prepared by his committee that indicated
the number of hard-core addicts was more than double an earlier
estimate by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
   William Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, called Biden's statement ``ridiculous'' and said it was
designed to provide ammunition for next fall's congressional
elections.
   The administration, Bennett said, has assumed from the outset of
the drug war that there are about 4 million hard-core addicts and
that the national drug strategy is working.
   After being at odds in separate interviews throughout the day,
Biden and Bennett clashed Thursday night on the Public Broadcasting
System show, the ``MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour.''
   Bennett told Biden sharply that ``you are trying to discredit
our policy'' and ``we think this is just a bit disingenous.''
   ``I don't like this rhetoric, Bill,'' Biden shot back. ``I don't
like these cheap shots about being disingenuous.''
   Nearly one of every 100 Americans is a weekly cocaine user, and
some areas of the United States have ``extraordinarily high
concentrations'' of addicts, according to the report. The study
defined a hard-core user as someone who uses cocaine once a week.
   One of every 40 people in New York state uses cocaine at least
once a week, the study said. The nation's capital has the highest
per capita rate, 32.9 hard-core users among every 1,000 Washington
residents, according to the report.
   Biden said an an earlier estimate of 862,000 U.S. addicts made
by the National Institute of Drug Abuse was far too low.
   The Judiciary Committee findings, prepared under the supervision
of Mark A.R. Kleiman of the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard, underscored a dispute between Biden and a number of other
lawmakers and the administration about whether to aim the thrust of
the drug war against hard-core or casual users.
   Biden has said hard-core users should be the primary target,
while Bennett has advocated efforts directed mainly at stemming
casual cocaine use.
   ``Our consciences demand that we act, our pocketbooks command
that we do so and our safety demands that it be done immediately,''
Biden said, unveiling a $3 billion drug-fighting plan that includes
stepped up research to find new treatments and doubling
crime-fighting grants to $900 million a year.
   Dr. Edgar Adams of the National Institute of Drug Abuse
described the 37-page report, ``Hard-Core Cocaine Addicts:
Measuring and Fighting the Epidemic,'' as ``a good attempt to look
at what is a very complex problem.''
   Adams cautioned that it might be hard to figure the margin of
error in the Senate figures, but praised the study because it
``restates the fact that drug abuse is a very serious problem.''
   The report said that only one out of 10 hard-core addicts
receives drug treatment and that most who are arrested are quickly
back out on the streets.
   Bennett said in a telephone interview that he saw no way in
which the report contributed to the war against drugs and was
scornful of its claim that the government had undercounted.
   ``This is ridiculous,'' Bennett said. ``What official estimate
is he talking about? There is no official estimate. In the national
drug control strategy we use a number larger than the one he is
using. We use 4 million.''
   Adams said homeless invididuals were not counted in the the NIDA
study.
   He said the institute maintained a 95 percent confidence level
for its estimate of 862,000 hard-core addicts in households.
   The committee report said 1.5 million hard-core cocaine addicts
were arrested annually and represent about 20 percent of arrestees
nationwide.
   ``This suggest that cocaine is a major cause of crime in the
United States,'' it said.
   The report estimated that New York state had the most hard-core
addicts, 434,000, followed by California, 325,000; Texas, 144,000;
Illinois, 142,000; and Florida, 93,000.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic OK'd for Government Contracts Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said Thursday it had
agreed to let Bell Atlantic Corp. and a subsidiary, Chesapeake and
Potomac Telephone Co., bid on government contracts again.
   The department had suspended Bell Atlantic and C&amp;P on April 3
from contracting with the executive branch on the grounds the
companies had ``made a material misrepresentation in competing for
the contract'' in January to provide a new digital telephone system
for Treasury offices in the Washington area.
   ``We came to an agreement with them'' to lift the no-contracting
order, said Treasury spokesman Art Siddon. He would not elaborate
on what the agreement was or what the misrepresentation been.
   Bell Atlantic said it ``has since submitted information in
support of its position that it did not misrepresent any fact to
Treasury.''
   ``Treasury has agreed to terminate the suspension and all
related administrative action, and Bell Atlantic has agreed to
reemphasize to its employees, and to the employees of its
subsidiaries, the need to verify all information provided to the
government, including information supplied by subcontractors.''
   Bell Atlantic spokesman Ken Pitt said confusion arose over the
type of phones the company was offering. He said the subcontracting
equipment manufacturer, Northern Telecom, had several versions of
the phone being offered, all carrying the same model number.
   ``Treasury alleged we were offering one set, but really were
offering another,'' Pitt said. ``We submitted the manufacturer's
documentation but the manufacturer's documentation had not kept
pace with its market offerings.''
   Siddon said Bell Atlantic did not lose any Treasury business
during the suspension.
   The digital phone system contract at Treasury is valued at
between $60 million and $100 million. Treasury twice has awarded
the contract to the American Telephone and Telegraph Co., and Bell
Atlantic won appeals to reopen the bidding.
   Pitt said he did not know if Bell Atlantic was still in the
running for the contract.

   Two juries in the Bensonhurst racial slaying
deliberated a second day without a verdict Thursday as police in
riot gear stood guard at the courthouse, where demonstrators
attacked a defense attorney a day earlier.
   Separate state Supreme Court juries are considering the cases
against alleged gang leader Keith Mondello and accused gunman
Joseph Fama, both 19.
   The defendants, both white, are charged with second-degree
murder and other crimes in the Aug. 23 slaying of 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins, who was black. Each faces 25 years to life if convicted of
murder.
   Rain sent demonstrators in the courthouse square scurrying for
cover and their cardboard placards became sodden and smeared. A
police officer on the scene said 100 protesters gathered in the
square at one point Thursday but virtually no one remained by late
afternoon.
   On Wednesday, Mondello's attorney, Stephen Murphy, was punched
in the face by one of about 300 protesters demanding murder
convictions in the case.
   When Murphy took a lunch break Thursday he was surrounded
briefly by a handful of protesters shouting ``Yusuf, Yusuf,'' but
he returned to the courthouse without incident.
   Lines of blue police barricades were erected in front of the
courthouse and more than 50 police officers, many in riot gear,
were on hand.
   Inside, jurors considering the charges against Mondello and Fama
continued to rehear trial testimony and to re-examine evidence.
Thursday was the third full day of deliberations for the Fama jury
and the second full day for the Mondello panel.
   Both juries went home for the night Thursday without reaching
verdicts.
   Prosecutors allege Mondello organized a mob of bat-carrying
whites who surrounded Hawkins and his three companions, all black.
Fama allegedly stepped from the mob and fatally shot Hawkins in the
chest with a .32 caliber automatic.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens said the juries, which are sequestered
during deliberations, would work through the weekend if they fail
to reach a verdict earlier.

   The United States, France and Britain have
asked the Soviet Union to allow more air travel to and from Berlin,
a U.S. spokesman said Thursday.
   The four World War II Allies still retain control over air
travel in the once-divided city. The Western powers for several
years have been urging more access, to boost Berlin's status.
   ``In view of the significant changes in and around Berlin in
recent months, the Allies believe that greater aviation access and
greater coordination among Berlin's aviation authorities can and
should be achieved,'' said a statement from Anthony W. Sariti,
spokesman for the U.S. mission in West Berlin.
   It continued: ``Even prior to unification, the Four Powers can
work constructively with the two German states for greatly
improving Berlin's aviation links.''
   The statement said representatives from France, Britain and the
United States presented the proposals during a meeting with
officials from the Soviet embassy on Thursday.
   In addition to possible objections from the Soviets, the
proposals for more air traffic are likely to run into difficulties
with German environmental groups.
   Ecologists say Berlin's skies are already overcrowded with
commercial airliners, and have urged more use of rail travel.

   Gunmen killed four policemen in the last
24 hours in Medellin, raising to 42 the number of law enforcement
officers slain in that city the last two months, police said
Thursday.
   Authorities have blamed cocaine traffickers for most of the
attacks against police.
   Police said last month the cartel was offering $4,300 for each
police officer killed and $10,500 for each anti-terrorist squad
leader assassinated.
   The unit has been sent to the city to search for leader of the
Medellin drug cartel, Pablo Escobar.
   A police communique said unidentified assailants shot and killed
three officers Thursday and one policeman was killed Wednesday
night.
   Despite the violence, Colombian authorities continued their
crackdown on drug traffickers Thursday, arresting a lawyer who
relayed messages between the cartel and the government.
   Soldiers raided the Medellin home of Guido Parra and arrested
the lawyer on charges of aiding and abetting drug terrorists, an
army communique said.
   They also arrested Berta Mejilla de Serna, a councilwoman for
the town of Envigado, and an architect, Diego Londono White, on the
same charges, the communique said.
   Authorities have long suspected that Envigado, a town outside
Medellin, is a center of drug trafficking.
   The arrests are part of the an anti-drug campaign that has
netted 30,800 pounds of cocaine the past two weeks.
   The chief of Colombia's national police, Gen. Miguel Gomez,
warned that violence could increase as the May 27 presidential
election approaches.
   At a news conference Wednesday night, he said more than 230,000
members of Colombia's security forces would be deployed to prevent
election violence.
   Three candidates have been assassinated by suspected drug
dealers in the campaign.
   Also Thursday, the Supreme Court disqualified four minor
presidential candidates who did not meet eligibility requirements.
   The ruling reduced from 12 to eight the number of candidates
contesting the elections. Political analysts gave the disqualified
candidates no chances of winning.
   Colombian law requires candidates to have a university degree
and four years of work experience.

   The former president of a Manila bank testified
in Imelda Marcos' fraud trial Thursday that millions of dollars
from accounts secretly held by the Marcoses were used to buy
Manhattan real estate.
   Rolando Gapud, a key government witness, said he personally
managed a series of numbered accounts at his bank, Security Bank
and Trust Co., for Mrs. Marcos and her husband, former Philippine
president Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   Gapud said Marcos had secretly acquired control of the bank in
1980 and ordered the opening of the accounts a year later.
   Gapud testified that between 1982 and 1985, he transferred $50
to $60 million from the accounts for the purchase and maintenance
of four New York buildings _ 40 Wall St., the Crown Building at 730
Fifth Ave., Herald Center and 200 Madison Ave.
   The transfers were made on the instructions of Mrs. Marcos'
personal secretary, Fe Roa Jimenez, Gapud said.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of helping her late husband loot their
nation's treasury of more than $220 million to secretly buy the New
York properties identified by Gapud.
   She has pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with mail fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping
the Marcoses hide their ownership of the four buildings and artwork.
   Gapud described the complicated process by which the Marcoses'
involvement in the transactions was kept confidential.
   He said the accounts at his bank, which all had ``7700''
numbers, were opened through other numbered accounts at a Hong Kong
bank that were secretly held by the Marcoses.
   The money transferred from the Security Bank accounts went to
corporations controlled by the Marcoses, which were used to buy the
buildings, Gapud said.
   The banker also told of the means by which the Marcoses bypassed
Philippine Central Bank regulations that limited the amount of U.S.
dollars allowed out of the country.
   In one scheme, Gapud said he and Geronimo Velasco, Marcos'
former Minister of Energy, arranged to have the dollar profits from
exports of the government-owned Philippine National Oil Company
deposited into Marcos bank accounts in the United States.
   The oil company was reimbursed with the equivalent in Philippine
pesos from the ``7700'' accounts at Security Bank and Trust Co.,
Gapud said.
   These transactions took place between October 1982 and the
spring of 1983 and involved $70 million, he said. Part of the money
was used toward the purchase of 40 Wall St. in December 1982, he
said.
   Gapud said Philippine businessmen also were asked to submit
phony applications to the Central Bank for approval to transfer
dollars from the Philippines.
   In two instances _ one involving a $30 million transfer and
another $8 million _ Gapud said the businessmen were acting as
fronts for Marcos, who gave them pesos from the ``7700'' accounts
to pay for the U.S. dollars.

   Thirty-four tombs at a Jewish cemetery were
desecrated by vandals, and the body of an elderly man was dug up
and impaled on an umbrella, authorities said Thursday.
   Leaders across the political spectrum reacted with outrage at
the desecration, one of the worst such incidents ever in France. It
occurred two days after a nationwide telecast of a three-hour
documentary about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said several tombs in the
south-central town of Carpentras were left ``in conditions so
abominable that one can't describe them without embarrassment.'' He
traveled to the town to inspect the site.
   ``I learned with horror of this criminal act,'' President
Francois Mitterrand said in a telegram to Freddy Haddad, a Jewish
leader in Carpentras.
   Mitterrand later went to the Paris home of France's chief rabbi,
Joseph Sitruk, to express his distress and solidarity.
   ``I've come as one does for a family in mourning,'' Mitterrand
said.
   Sitruk said: ``A civilization that doesn't respect the dead is
headed toward destruction of the living.''
   Police said the body of an 81-year-old man who died about two
weeks ago was found impaled on an umbrella when the desecration was
discovered early Thursday. Grave markers were knocked over and
flower pots were trampled, but no graffiti were found.
   ``It is unimaginable that such deeds are possible in France,''
said Joxe.
   Jean Kahn, leader of a national coalition of Jewish groups, said
the desecration came at a time when racial hatred was being
encouraged ``by those who promote anti-Semitic rhetoric and fascist
themes.''
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose extreme-right National Front party has
been accused of condoning anti-Semitism, condemned the desecration
as ``barbaric behavior.''
   No one claimed responsibility for the desecration, and no
arrests were reported.
   Carpentras, with a population of about 26,000, is 60 miles north
of Marseille. Its mayor, Jean-Claude Andrieu, described it as a
quiet town in which the Jewish community lived harmoniously.
   Several incidents of vandalism have occurred at Jewish
cemeteries in recent years, most recently when anti-Semitic slogans
were scrawled on tombs near Paris late last year.
   In Los Angeles, Rabbi Marvin Hier, head of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, condemned the desecration as a ``despicable act that stains
the name of humanity. It shows that in the heart of Western
civilization there are those against us who given the opportunity
would operate once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz.''

   Israeli officials on Thursday criticized the
United States for creating an ``artificial storm'' over Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said he was concerned by reports
the Bush administration was coordinating with Arab states in
drafting a U.N. resolution opposing the settlement of Soviet Jews
in the occupied territories.
   ``I am troubled by the activity of the United States when the
Arab countries raise in the U.N. Security Council the issue of
immigration from the Soviet Union,'' Arens said on Israel radio.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said recent Israeli moves to build settlements in the occupied
territories had ``raised some resentment in the United States.''
   But, he added, ``We hope that this artificial storm will be over
very soon.''
   Arens summoned U.S. Ambassador William Brown to the foreign
ministry Wednesday night to protest the U.S. efforts to formulate
the U.N. resolution.
   He said the move encouraged ``the Arab attack on the right of
Jews to immigrate to Israel.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
said the United States strongly supported the immigration to Israel.
   ``We want to see immigration take place and will oppose efforts
by anyone to block it,'' Tutwiler said.
   But, she added, ``the government of Israel is well aware of our
concern that Soviet Jews not be encouraged to move into the
(occupied) territories.''
   A key paragraph of the working draft composed by non-aligned and
Arab states claims settlements in the occupied territories are in
violation of international law, a stronger wording than the U.S.
position that contends settlements are an obstacle to peacemaking.
   Israeli officials said there was no policy of settling Soviet
immigrants in occupied lands and no basis to suggest settlements
were illegal under conventions governing the conduct of occupying
powers.
   Other hard-line sections of the two-page document demanded the
right of return for Palestinian exiles, ``impartial protection''
for Palestinian civilians and a halt in aid that can be used for
settlements.
   The draft grew out of a March call by the Soviet Union for a
debate on the settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied territories.
   A U.N. vote on the settlement resolution, scheduled for
Thursday, was postponed with no new date set.
   Israeli officials said the United States should veto the
resolution because it is part of ``political warfare'' being waged
by Arabs, who were opposed to any immigration to Israel.
   They argued Western states could not support the resolution
without violating their stand in support of freedom of movement.
   In the past, the United States has vetoed most anti-Israel
resolutions, but officials said this time U.N. Ambassador Thomas R.
Pickering has been seeking a compromise with Arab states. He
proposed various changes earlier this week to soften the hard-line
sections, but details were not available.
   ``There's no doubt that at this moment we are going through a
period of tension with the United States,'' Arens said.
   Despite the concerns, Shamir's caretaker government helped fund
a Jewish settlement in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's Old
City, and began construction on two new settlements, one in the
West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip.
   ``One can say some mistakes were made by elements responsible''
for the Old City settlement, Ahimeir acknowledged, ``but it does
not justify a political campaign against Israel.''
   The Old City settlers were ordered out of the building they
inhabited after the Supreme Court decided it was purchased
illegally.
   More than 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and Gaza

   Gad Ben Ari, spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency
that assists immigrants, said only about 200 of the 30,000 Soviet
immigrants who arrived this year have chosen to live in the
occupied territories.

   Pope John Paul II on Thursday
criticized populous Mexico's family planning program, called for
freedom of religious education and demanded greater parental input
on sex education in public schools.
   John Paul backed Roman Catholic parents' groups pressing for
religious education. He said they have ``the right to freely
educate their children according to their own religious
convictions'' and to have the laws of their country ``explicitly
recognize that right.''
   Religious schools are constitutionally prohibited in Mexico,
although many exist and are tolerated despite the ban. Religious
education would probably expand quickly if the ban were lifted,
however.
   The pontiff noted in a speech before more than 100,000 people
that educational freedom is a right recognized by the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, ``even though serious legislative
limits still exist in some countries.''
   It was the fifth day of the pontiff's eight-day Mexican journey.
The crowd included thousands of U.S. residents who traveled by bus
and car to Chihuahua, 220 miles south of El Paso, Texas.
   The pontiff spoke from a platform on a dusty field with the
bare, brown Sierra Madre mountains in the background. Thousands in
the audience waved flags in Vatican yellow and white. Many wore
straw hats and caps.
   The sunny day was marred by word that a plane carrying pilgrims
crashed near Tuxtla Gutierrez, more than 1,000 miles away in
southeastern Mexico. The pope visits Tuxtla Gutierrez on Friday;
more than two dozen were reported dead in the crash, including the
bishop of Tapachula, Luis Miguel Canton Marin.
   ``May God grant the dead eternal rest and a rapid recovery to
the injured,'' John Paul said Thursday evening in the northern
industrialized city of Monterrey, in a brief comment on the
accident. He spoke before a crowd there estimated at more than
500,000, by far the largest of the trip.
   The pope changed his Friday schedule and will visit the
cathedral in Tuxtla Gutierrez to pray for the victims and offer
condolences to their families.
   In his homily at a Mass dedicated to workers, the pontiff again
condemned the materialism of the capitalist system.
   ``Without denying the good results obtained ... where a free
system reigns, we still cannot be blinded to the defects of an
economic system that not infrequently makes riches and consumption
its principle engine,'' he said.
   Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, is less than 100 miles
from Laredo, Texas, and the crowd included thousands of U.S.
residents. The service took place in the dry bed of the Santa
Catarina River.
   At Chihuahua, the pope reiterated the church's opposition to
artificial contraceptives.
   ``If, in the conjugal union, the possibility of conceiving a
child is artificially eliminated, the couple closed themselves to
God and opposed his will, '' John Paul said.
   The standard church message has political implications in
Mexico, where since the mid-1970s the government has encouraged use
of contraceptives to limit a mushrooming population. Government
health clinics distribute contraceptives and perform vasectomies,
but abortion is illegal.
   The program, one of the most succesful in the Third World, has
helped cut the population growth rate from nearly 3.7 percent in
1977 to 1.9 percent, according to government figures.
   Nearly half the married women in this overwhelmingly Catholic
country use contraceptives, according to International Planned
Parenthood figures. Still, the population has increased nearly 30
percent _ reaching 85 million _ since John Paul first visited in
1979.
   Strong religious restrictions were written into the 1917
constitution after liberals defeated church-backed conservatives
during the Mexican Revolution.
   The pope said that by using birth control, a husband and wife
``closed themselves to each other, in that they reject the mutual
giving in paternity and maternity, reducing the conjugal union to
an occasion for satisfying the egoism of each one.''
   The papal position has drawn fire in Mexico, where infant
mortality, illiteracy and malnutrition are major problems.
   John Paul also said sex education that ignores moral values
``constitutes an impoverishment of the person and contributes to
obscuring his dignity.''
   The pope attacked elements he said violated the human rights of
children, including abortion, malnutrition, lack of affection,
violence and drugs.
   He also paid a Mother's Day tribute to Mexican women; Mother's
Day is celebrated on May 10 in Latin America.

<TEXT>
   Lake Eufaula, the reservoir some call a
``gentle giant,'' has turned into a menace as farmers and residents
hundreds of miles away in Arkansas battle floods unleashed from the
lake because of heavy rains.
   But U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials, criticized about the
timing of the release of water from reservoirs, are standing their
ground. Were it not for reservoirs like Eufaula on the Arkansas
River and Lake Texoma on the Red River, the flooding downstream
could have been much worse, they say.
   Decisions made by the corps on how fast to release water from
the reservoirs it manages can have a crucial effect on who is
flooded, and how severely. A too-early release of water through the
dam's floodgates after a heavy rain increases flooding downstream,
while slower release can mean more flooding upstream if the
reservoir fills up.
   Questions about the management of the reservoirs was raised anew
Wednesday when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton met with a group of angry
farmers and agreed with a suggestion that a study of corps efforts
to control Red River floodwaters might be in order.
   But in the main, said corps spokesman Ross Adkins, the
reservoirs have done their job this past week.
   ``Our projects operated as they were designed to. We managed
them just exactly as they were designed to operate,'' said Adkins.
   ``What we do is capture all the water we can to minimize any
damages downstream. When Mother Nature dumps as much rain as we had
... (the reservoirs) took off a heck of a big bump that could have
gone downstream.
   ``If we had not been here, a lot more houses and perhaps lives
would have been lost,'' he said.
   The flooding on the Trinity, Red and Arkansas rivers was touched
off by severe storms last week. Some areas of eastern Oklahoma,
already saturated from a wet spring, had as much as 12 inches of
rain.
   Thirteen deaths were blamed on the storm, most of them in Texas.
   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, toured
hard-hit south Dallas on Thursday. She backed proposals to extend
levees that protect the hard-hit Rochester Park neighborhood.
   ``You will be in our prayers,'' Mrs. Quayle told residents whose
homes are still underwater.
   Complete damage figures for the region were not yet compiled,
but the Red Cross says as many as 600 homes in Oklahoma may have
been damaged by the flooding. In Texas, estimated damage to
agricultural production stands at $500 million and $700 million.
   A disaster declaration was expanded Thursday to cover nine north
Texas counties. Sixteen counties had already been declared disaster
areas, an action that leads to federal assistance and low-interest
loans for repairs.
   In Arkansas, preliminary figures from six counties and one
metropolitan area show flood damage to 251 homes and 13 businesses,
said Gary Talley, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency
Services.
   As the water moved downstream from here, Arkansas has
experienced some of the worst flooding in decades as the Arkansas
and Red rivers flowed over their banks. Hundreds of homes have been
damaged.
   The Arkansas crested at Pine Bluff in central Arkansas on
Wednesday, and the Red crested near Texarkana, Texas, at the
Texas-Arkansas line Thursday morning, but officials say rivers are
receding so slowly and the ground is so saturated that the
floodwaters will remain for days or even weeks.
   After the rains, Lake Texoma, built in 1944, reached a record
644.76 feet, almost 27 feet above the normal level, and water
roared over its spillway and down the Red River for the first time
since 1957. Lake Eufaula, completed in 1964, also reached a record
height.
   The resulting flooding downstream led some Arkansas farmers to
unleash their frustrations at the meeting with Clinton.
   ``So many of them down there felt, rightly or wrongly, that the
corps could have made different decisions over the last few months
(and) there would be less flooding,'' Clinton said afterward.
   One farmer asked if a task force could be established to
evaluate the corps' policies. Clinton said he thought that was a
good suggestion.
   But residents upstream from the lakes also have their questions,
wondering if the corps should have started to release water earlier.
   Jeff Van Cleave, who runs the Salty Pelican restaurant on the
shore of Lake Eufaula, said he had to close April 27 because water
had covered roads leading to the restaurant. He wasn't able to
reopen until Wednesday.
   ``It was a serious matter,'' Van Cleave said Thursday. ``There
were a lot of people concerned around here that they were holding
the water back too long.''
   But Van Cleave acknowledged that Eufaula is a flood control lake
and said corps officials must concern themselves with downstream
flooding as well as upstream problems.
   ``I wouldn't take that job for all the tea in China,'' he said.
   At Eufaula on Thursday, mist rose over the lake where 98,000
cubic feet of water was being released per second. The amount of
water being sent downstream was less than half the 230,000 cubic
feet per second released at the peak of the flooding last week, but
still more than twice the old record release rate of 40,000 cubic
feet per second, said Jim Holderfield, a corps supervisor at Lake
Eufaula.
   Barbara Craven, a spokeswoman in the corps' Tulsa office, said
water was coming into the lake at up to 490,000 cubic feet per
second because of heavy rains and runoff from three rivers upstream.
   Without the reservoir, she said, people and businesses
downstream ``would have had 490,000 cubic feet per second come
right at them.''
   ``By controlling the amount of water releases, we bought a
little time to prepare people downstream,'' she said.
   Officials said they are more concerned with what lies ahead in
the next six weeks, typically the rainy season in Oklahoma.
   ``May is our wettest month,'' Ms. Craven said. ``We're looking
at reservoirs that are filled to the brim right now. We're trying
our best.''

   Two Dutch F-16 jet fighters
collided three miles over Labrador on Thursday during NATO training
maneuvers. One pilot was injured while ejecting from his
single-seat craft, but there was no sign the second pilot survived.
   The mid-afternoon collision occurred at 17,000 feet, about 45
miles north of Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay and 8 miles west of
Grand Lake, the Canadian military said.
   ``One pilot was seen to eject and has been reached by a Canadian
Forces search-and-rescue helicopter,'' the Forces said in a
statement. Lt. Rein Sneek, based in Lewarden, the Netherlands, was
airlifted to a hospital in Goose Bay suffering from multiple
abrasions and bruises, a base spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Lt. Jeff Agnew, said they had no idea how the
crash occurred. He said the military was hoping to get more
information from the injured pilot, who was hospitalized overnight
for observation.
   The search continues for the second pilot, identified as Capt.
Leo Vogt. Agnew said a NATO aircraft in the area at the time of the
crash saw no parachute from the second plane and that there was no
evidence Vogt was able to eject.
   Asked if low-level flying _ a practice long protested by natives
in the area _ played a part in the accident, Agnew replied:
``Absolutely not.''
   A Forces statement said: ``The collision occurred at 17,000 feet
and was not due to low-level flying.''
   Jets on low-level flights often dip as low as 100 feet from the
ground _ the height of a tall tree.
   The Dutch aircraft were taking part in a NATO air defense
exercise.
   Known as the Falcon, the American-built F-16 is a single-engine
fighter used by the U.S. and Dutch air forces.
   The Netherlands is among several NATO countries that send
hundreds of pilots each year to CFB Goose Bay to train in low-level
flying and combat techniques.
   Innu who live in the area say the training flights, which take
place each year from April to November, are disrupting their way of
life and harming caribou herds. There have been numerous protests
to try to stop the flights.
   A board of inquiry will be convened by the Royal Netherlands Air
Force to investigate the crash, Agnew said.

   A plane carrying pilgrims to see
Pope John Paul II crashed Thursday and killed at least 27 of the 38
people on board, including a bishop and some government officials,
authorities said.
   The crash was near the military airport of the southeastern city
of Tuxtla Gutierrez, where the pope is to visit Friday.
   The Rev. Jorge Valenti, secretary to the bishop of Tapachula,
Monsignor Luis Miguel Canton Marin, said the bishop died in the
crash.
   The Dutch-made, propeller-driven F-27 Fokker crashed at about
8:55 a.m., just under two miles from the airport runway, said
Miguel Angel Guadarrama, manager of the airline Aviacion de
Chiapas, S.A.
   He said 38 people were aboard, including the crew. One of the 12
initial survivors later died of injuries, a Red Cross worker said.
   ``Many of the passengers, in fact most of them, were government
officials,'' Guadarrama said.
   The pope, who earlier flew to the northern city of Chihuahua on
Thursday, isolated himself en route to his next stop, Monterrey, to
pray for the victims.
   ``We pray that God will give eternal rest to the dead and for
the recovery of the wounded and we pray that God will console the
habitants of Tapachula so they keep the faith,'' he said.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The weather
appeared to be clear on television footage from the scene, but the
area is known for fog.
   The badly charred wreck lay scattered in a field, its propellers
twisted. Soldiers surrounded it, keeping back onlookers. Despite
the security, some looting of luggage occurred.
   ``Just imagine the scene, it was quite awful,'' Red Cross
volunteer Guillermo Diaz Gorodillo said in a telephone interview.
``Luckily, the plane crashed in an open field, surrounded by
private homes so that many people rushed out to help the
survivors.''
   Diaz Gordillo said the plane was in flames when he and about 18
other Red Cross volunteers reached the crash site. ``Five of them
were unscathed, including a mother and her newborn baby. The others
were badly injured, and one just died here at the Red Cross,'' he
said.
   The plane was on a scheduled run from Tapachula, on the border
with Guatemala. Officials said many of the government people were
coming for John Paul's visit to Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of
Chiapas state.
   Aviacion de Chiapas, or Avicsa, is a regional commercial airline
that operates in southeastern Mexico and uses the military base.
   The plane can carry up to 44 passengers and a crew of four.

<HEAD>Actor Charlie Farrell, Television Father of `My Little Margie,'
Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Charlie Farrell, silent film
star of ``Seventh Heaven'' and the TV father in the popular 1950s
series ``My Little Margie,'' died at his desert home, it was
disclosed Thursday. He was 89.
   Farrell died of heart failure Sunday at his Palm Springs home,
said Willim Broman, a deputy at the Riverside County Coroner's
Office. The coroner was involved because there was no attending
physician at the time of death.
   The actor was buried Wednesday at Welwood Murray Cemetery in
Palm Springs.
   Farrell ran an exclusive Palm Springs tennis club for years and
helped to boost the reputation of the desert resort as a Hollywood
mecca. He even dabbled in politics, serving as the city's mayor at
one point.
   Born Aug. 9, 1902, in Walpole, Mass., Farrell came to California
in 1923 seeking a show business career. He stepped into $3-a-day
extra roles, then leapt into stardom with a minor role in ``The Ten
Commandments,'' the 1923 Cecil B. de Mille production.
   Farrell retired from movies after making about 10 silents and
more than 40 talkies.
   It was in the 1927 silent ``Seventh Heaven'' that Farrell and
Janet Gaynor established themselves as the screen's top heartbeats.
   ``Janet and I were in the Top 10 box-office draws for two years
after that ... even into talkies,'' he said in a 1977 interview.
``We had a string of real good pictures. `Street Angel,' `Sunnyside
Up'... `Seventh Heaven' was the best, though.''
   ``Seventh Heaven'' walked away with the best director and
actress Oscars at the first Academy Awards.
   With the invention of television, Farrell was brought into
America's living rooms as a widower father opposite Gale Storm on
150 episodes of ``My Little Margie.''
   ``I had a helluva career,'' he said in a 1977 interview. ``The
truth of it was, I didn't get along with the studio brass. They
wanted that Cagney thing all the time. So I got out.''
   Before World War II, Farrell was a polo fanatic who would play
with Will Rogers at the humorist's Sunset Boulevard ranch. But he
eventually moved to the desert and concentrated on tennis.
   Farrell and his actress-wife Virginia Valli, who died in
September 1968, worked with partner Ralph Bellamy to develop the
posh Palm Springs Racquet Club, which became a popular refuge for
Hollywood elite.
   ``He was very affable, a wonderful friend,'' Bellamy said
Thursday after learning of Farrell's death. ``He was a great
greeter and a great back-slapper, much better than I was. He was
the perfect fella to run the club.''
   When they started the club in 1934, there were less than 200
people living there and ``no paved roads,'' said Bellamy.
   The Farrells were first citizens of the now-thriving desert
community 100 miles east of Los Angeles. They were probably as much
responsible as anyone for the growth of Palm Springs from an Indian
reservation into a famed playground for millionaires.
   ``There is no doubt about it, the club started the popularity of
Palm Springs. And everybody liked Charlie,'' said Bellamy.
   Farrell enjoyed running the club more than show business.
   ``The club is more fun, I'm playing tennis all the time and
socializing, but it's harder work,'' he said before selling the
Racquet Club in 1959.
   Farrell was mayor of Palm Springs for six years, from 1948 to
1953, and he successfully fought efforts of gamblers intent on
moving into the area.
   His movie roles included parts in ``Wings of Youth,'' ``Sandy,''
``Old Ironsides,'' ``The Rough Riders,'' ``Street Angel,''
``Fazil,'' ``The Red Dance,'' ``The River,'' ``City Girl,'' ``Lucky
Star,'' ``Sunny Side Up,'' ``Happy Days,'' ``High Society Blues,''
``Girl Without a Room,'' ``The Big Shakedown,'' ``Aggie Appleby''
and ``The World is Ours.''

<HEAD>Missing Chinese Farmers Send Letter to Host</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Chinese peasants reportedly kidnapped
shortly after they arrived in the United States for an exchange
program apparently slipped away for some sightseeing in New York,
officials said Thursday.
   The Massachusetts farmer who is hosting the rest of the group
received a letter from the missing Chinese, police said. It was the
first contact since the farmers disappeared shortly after arriving
at Kennedy International Airport on April 26.
   The letter says they arranged to slip away from the airport, and
have been afraid to come forward since for fear of being deported
as illegal immigrants, said Sgt. Thomas O'Reilly of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   The seven, part of a group of 16, had been hustled into a
waiting car at the airport, according to their host, Molly Aitken,
president of the World Energy Foundation. She said she believed
they had been abducted.
   The Port Authority, which operates the airport, has been
investigating the case as a possible kidnapping. But officers
suggested all along the disappearance could be a scheme to enter
the country illegally.
   Federal involvement has been minimal.
   The group, from the Fujian Province in southern China, was
headed to Ms. Aitken's farm in Athol, Mass., to study organic
farming for 11 months.
   The seven apparently wanted to see some of New York before
heading off to rural Massachusetts, according to the letter,
O'Reilly said. The letter was signed by three of the missing
peasants, and began by saying it was from all seven, O'Reilly said.
   The letter, with no return address and a New York postmark,
arrived at Aitken's Green Gables Farm on Wednesday and Aitken
telephoned Port Authority police.
   Investigators were always skeptical about the kidnapping theory,
questioning how three alleged abductors were able to grab seven
people without using any weapons, then stuff them into a small car.
   Apparently the missing Chinese made contact with their friend at
the airport and ran for the car, O'Reilly said. The letter said
they planned to stay in town for a couple days and see Chinatown,
but they have been unwilling to come forward for fear they may be
deported or never see their families in China again.
   O'Reilly said the Port Authority police haven't any legal
complaint against the seven, and suggested they could smooth over
any problems with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``Then their only problem would be with mainland China,''
O'Reilly said.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Government Workers Go on Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government workers declared an
indefinite strike and said they would take over state offices after
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro suspended a civil service law
on Thursday.
   The 60,000-member General Federation of State Workers said the
strike included ``immediate takeover of installations and blocking
of access by ministers and vice ministers of the government of Mrs.
Chamorro.''
   A Federation communique said the government is ``preparing
general conditions for massive firing of state workers.''
   Earlier Thursday, Mrs. Chamorro ordered another devaluation of
Nicaragua's currency, the fourth in three weeks, and steeply
increased prices for utilities and public services.
   Adding to her woes, in Miami, the Contra rebels accused lefist
Sandinista holdovers in her administration of failing to live up to
signed agreements and announced plans to stop demobilizing.
   The president ordered the value of the cordoba cut by 9 percent
in relation to the U.S. dollar, in her second devaluation in two
days.
   She also abolished government subsidies for transportation and
raised rates for many state-run public services.
   The price of running water was doubled, electricity rates went
up 300 percent and telephone service, 1,300 percent.
   In announcing the ``painful'' measures, presidential aide
Antonio Lacayo said 10 years of Sandinista rule left Nicaragua
``badly and seriously bankrupt.''
   Officials say there was only $3 million in the treasury and a
foreign debt of $11 billion when Mrs. Chamorro took office last
month in this country of 3.5 million people.
   The Sandinistas devalued the cordoba 41 times last year and
eight more times before leaving office on April 25.
   When the Sandinistas overthrew rightist dictator Anastasio
Somoza and seized power in July 1979, the cordoba was traded at 10
to the dollar. On Thursday, 196,472 cordobas bought $1 on the
parallel market, where most of the country's money is traded.
   Lacayo said the Chamorro administration had no idea Nicaragua's
economy was in such a shambles _ ``Consequently, measures will be
deeper, sharper, weightier and more painful for the people and the
country as a whole.''
   Inflation hit 33,600 percent in 1988, but dropped to 1,800
percent in 1989. There are no reliable estimates yet for this year.
   Mrs. Chamorro ordered a 60 percent pay increase for government
employees Wednesday. Workers protested it was not nearly enough to
catch up with soaring prices and labor leaders rejected it.
   Laborers average about $44 a month and white collar workers
about $100.
   Thousands of government employees at the national legislature,
the treasury, labor and foreign ministries and elsewhere staged
wildcat strikes.
   Hundreds of employees blocked the ministry entrance Thursday and
refused to let Construction and Transportation Minister Jaime
Icablzeta go in because he had fired an adviser, a civil servant.
   Jose Angel Bermudez of the new National Federation of Workers,
which claims a membership of 61,000, demanded a 200 percent
increase for all wage earners.
   The Council for Labor Action and Unity immediately backed him.
It is an arm of the Communist Party, which forms part of Mrs.
Chamorro's 14-party United National Opposition coalition.
   About 80 Contras turned in their weapons Tuesday to United
Nations troops, but spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said in Miami no
more rebels would do that.
   He said the procedure was ``being re-evaluated. This could slow
the process of disarmament.''
   The rebels, once backed by the United States, complain that the
demobilization agreement signed May 4 by their commanders and Mrs.
Chamorro was being subverted by former Sandinista officials who
still dominate many ministries, especially the military.
   Acevedo put the number of Contra fighters still holding arms at
more than 12,000, but most independent observers say their forces
have been reduced to a few thousand.

<HEAD>Official Vote Count: Vargas Llosa Won by Small Margin</HEAD>

   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa won the first
round of presidential elections by a slightly smaller percentage of
the vote than previously projected, according to the official vote
count Thursday.
   The National Election Board said the center-right Vargas Llosa
won 27.6 percent of the vote in the April 8 election while centrist
Alberto Fujimori captured 24.6 percent. The rest of the vote went
to other candidates.
   Post-election projections had shown Vargas Llosa winning 32
percent of the vote to Fujimori's 30 percent.
   The second round of elections next month pits the two
front-runners against each other. Polls indicate Fujimori leads
Vargas Llosa, author of such novels as ``Aunt Julia and the
Scriptwriter'' and ``The Green House,'' by 3 to 8 percentage points.
   The official vote tally took more than one month to release
because the results of 52,157 polling stations in this rugged South
American country had to be transported to the capital Lima to be
individually verified.
   The government had to await for the final election results to
announce the date of the final elections. Officials had said it
would probably be June 3 but many now say it may be held on June 10.
   The election took place in the midst of Peru's worst economic
crisis this century. The government is virtually bankrupt and the
annual inflation rate is above 2,000 percent.
   The balloting showed Luis Alva Castro, candidate of the ruling
populist Aprista Party of President Alan Garcia, received only 19.1
percent of the vote.
   Traditionally strong Marxist parties also faired poorly.
   Henry Pease of the United Left coalition took only 7 percent of
the vote while his former colleague, Alfonso Barrantes of the
Socialist Left alliance, finished with only 4.1 percent.
   Another 15.3 percent of the ballots were blank or declared
invalid and the remainder of votes went to smaller parties.
   The official results show 19.9 percent of the 9,823,062
registered voters did not take part in the election, despite the
threat of penalties including a $50 fine that almost equals a
month's wage for the average worker.
   Most of the absenteeism was in zones in the country's central
Andean mountains, where the Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrillas
launched a violent campaign to keep voters from the polls.
   It was not clear whether the high absenteeism was due to voter
fear or sympathy with the rebels, analysts said.
   More than 18,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path launched its armed insurgency on May 17, 1980, the
day before national elections ending 12 years of military
dictatorship.

   Radical students and dissidents fought
riot police in street battles in Seoul and other cities Thursday
for the second day, despite a government warning against violence.
   Riot police moved swiftly to disperse the groups of 200 to 500
students who chanted ``Down with President Roh Tae-woo!'' during
scattered protests in the capital.
   Thousands of riot police were deployed in downtown areas. They
tightened street checks and took away young pedestrians suspected
of participating in the clashes.
   Shortly before nightfall, riot troopers fired tear gas to
disperse 1,500 students carrying firebombs who had occupied a main
street on the eastern edge of downtown.
   News reports said thousands of radical students armed with
rocks, steel pipes and firebombs battled police Thursday outside
about 40 campuses or in the streets nationwide. Details were not
given.
   Police did not say how many people were arrested Thursday.
   Police detained 1,864 people in Seoul and 16 other cities during
Wednesday's street clashes, the largest and most violent since Roh
took office in February 1988.
   About 100,000 students and dissidents participated in
Wednesday's protests, and 247 police were injured. Protesters
demanded Roh annul the January merger of his ruling party with two
opposition groups and resign.
   On Wednesday, protesters attacked 24 police stations, governing
party offices and government buildings. An office of the U.S.
Information Service center in Seoul was gutted by firebombs.
   Country Director Eul Byong Yoon of U.S. Wheat Associates
reported when reached by phone that the Seoul office of the
international wheat promotion organization was in the same building
as the USIS and was destroyed in the fire there.
   Roh's government warned Thursday it would move swiftly and
forcibly to block labor and political violence.
   ``The government will mobilize all available resources to
restore law and order,'' Justice Minister Lee Jong-nam told a
televised news conference.
   Home Minister Ahn Eung-mo, who controls the nation's 130,000
police, told the same conference: ``The government will strictly
enforce laws to eradicate crimes and maintain social stability.''
   Dissidents said they would stage more protests.
   ``Let's destroy the pro-American fascist'' and ``Drive out the
Yankees,'' about 200 people shouted during a rally Thursday at
Myungdong Cathedral in central Seoul.
   The cathedral in 1987 was the focal point of nationwide
anti-government protests. That unrest involved hundreds of
thousands of demonstrators and forced authoritarian president Chun
Doo-hwan to carry out major democratic reforms, including the
presidential election that brought Roh to office.
   In southern Seoul, police firing tear gas clashed with about
1,000 honking taxi drivers who tried to rally to demand a 17.3
percent wage hike. The taxi drivers responded with rocks.
   Opposition and radical students say Roh's ruling Democratic
Liberal Party, formed after the merger of three parties, was a
``political coup d'etat,'' as it had not been ratified in an
election.
   Roh took office in 1988 after winning the country's first direct
presidential elections in 16 years. But his popularity has been
declining.
   Dissidents say the United States was behind a plot by government
conservatives to prolong their power through the merger.
   In the southeastern industrial city of Ulsan, 51 shipyard
workers ended a 13-day holdout on top of a 240-foot crane and were
admitted to a hospital for a medical checkup.
   Details were unavailable but the state radio, KBS, said the
workers were exhausted from a hunger strike begun five days ago. It
was unknown whether Thursday's government warning influenced the
workers' action.
   The workers fled atop the crane when 12,000 police firing tear
gas raided their shipyard on April 28 to end a strike. The workers
had threatened ``extreme action'' unless their demand for the
release of jailed union leaders was accepted.
   Officials of the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. in Seoul said they
plan to reopen the shipyard next week.
