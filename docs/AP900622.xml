   Allan Robert Bruce, veteran editor with
United Press International and often an official of the Wire
Service Guild, died at age 49.
   Bruce, an editor on the news agency's national desk in
Washington, had AIDS. He died Thursday at his home in the
Washington suburb of Alexandria.
   He joined UPI in 1963 in Buffalo, N.Y. and worked in
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida and in other bureaus in New
York before coming to Washington in 1985.
   Bruce was a former member of the national executive committee of
the union and served five times as a contract negotiator, including
the most recent talks that reached a tentative agreement with UPI.
   He is survived by three sisters.

   A 71-year-old woman was gored by
a bison near Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park.
   The slow-moving beast inflicted bruises and a four-inch cut on
Harriett Kimball's right side, and she was in stable condition
Friday, a day after the goring.
   ``It happened very fast,'' Kimball, of Medical Lake, Wash., said
in an interview from her hospital bed in Cody, Wyo.
   She said she was photographing an eruption of Old Faithful when
she noticed a large bison nearby and slightly behind her. The
animal appeared to be grazing and ambling along slowly towards her,
and ``he didn't look mean,'' Kimball recalled.
   Just after being warned by a friend that the buffalo was getting
too close, the bison walked towards her and knocked her over, then
walked away.
   It was the second reported bison injury this year in the park.
Earlier, a West German man was bruised when he was butted by a
bison.
   Park visitors are given leaflets warning that bison, which
appear docile, weigh up to 2,000 pounds, run up to 30 mph, and are
``wild, unpredictable, and dangerous.''
   The bison that gored Kimball is one of three large bulls that
have been near Old Faithful this spring, said to Tom Houghman, a
ranger-naturalist at the Old Faithful Visitor's Center. He said the
bull will be watched for further aggressive behavior.

   Diplomats, business leaders and celebrities
dropped all pretense of being jaded and demonstrated their
excitement Friday over Nelson Mandela, who later was the star
attraction at a celebrity fund-raiser.
   As the anti-apartheid leader strode to the podium in the
vaulted, green-carpeted General Assembly Hall at the United
Nations, several hundred delegates and dignitaries jumped to their
feet to cheer him.
   Earlier, he charmed about 150 top businesspeople at the World
Trade Center, where he expressed interest in U.S. companies and
foundations investing in a post-apartheid South Africa.
   ``There was a crackling excitement in the audience,'' said
Richard Leone, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey. ``I've spent a long time on Wall Street and you don't
usually see that in an audience of this type. It was quite an
exciting thing.''
   After the meeting at the skyscraper in lower Manhattan, Mandela,
still basking in the glow of euphoric crowds in Harlem and Yankee
Stadium a night earlier, told reporters: ``The reception has been
beyond my wildest dreams.''
   The U.N. speech came on the third day of Mandela's trip to the
United States and his last full day in New York, where he struck
deep emotional and political chords among the hundreds of thousands
who turned out to see him.
   Calling apartheid a ``crime against humanity,'' Mandela said:
``The sanctions that have been imposed by the United Nations and by
individual governments should remain in place.''
   The U.N. General Assembly has long been a leader in the battle
against apartheid. South Africa, a U.N. member, was ousted from the
General Assembly in 1974 and was not represented when Mandela spoke.
   Security has been extremely heavy in New York for the visit.
   In Johannesburg, South Africa, a newspaper reported Friday that
police arrested 11 whites in connection with a right-wing plot to
assassinate Mandela, President F.W. de Klerk and others.
   Authorities confirmed the arrests and said all were later
released.
   The Afrikaans-language weekly Vryeweekblad said that under the
plan, Mandela would have been shot at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts
Airport when he returned home July 18.
   Mandela, 71, finished the New York leg of his visit with a pair
of fund-raisers: one at the home of movie executive Arthur Krim,
the second at actor Robert De Niro's film production headquarters.
The Friday night parties were expected to generate more than $1
million for the African National Congress.
   Arriving at De Niro's party to cheers from the 200 or so
spectators behind police barricades were Denzel Washington, Eddie
Murphy, Bette Midler, Spike Lee, Robin Williams, Joe Piscopo and
Lou Diamond Phillips, among others. Madonna was among those
expected to attend but by the time the event started, she hadn't
been spotted by reporters outside the event, which was closed to
the media.
   The stars entered the restaurant under a banner reading
``Artists United Against Apartheid.''
   ``We're with him,'' said Little Steven Van Zandt. ``We'll do
everything he wants us to do. We're working for the South African
people.''
   Mandela left after about an hour to cheers from the hundreds of
people who waited outside in the rain.
   Lee reported: ``Nelson gave an inspiring speech. He stressed
that we should stay committed to the cultural boycott.''
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, taped an interview with Phil Donahue
that was televised in some areas Friday and will be broadcast
elsewhere on Monday. She reiterated that she would be the first to
resort to warfare if negotiations with the white rulers of South
Africa break down.
   Mandela started his day with an early morning walk through a
park adjacent to Mayor David Dinkins' residence, where he is
staying.
   During his Thursday stroll, Mandela, a former amateur boxer,
asked a police chief about where Tyson lives. On Friday, he met the
former heavyweight champion before the U.N. ceremonies.
   The 6-foot-4 Mandela towered over Tyson, who measures 5 feet, 10
inches, as the two locked in a handshake and chatted for about a
minute. They smiled broadly.
   ``He's a fighter in all aspects,'' Tyson said later. ``Truly he
is fighting the greatest fight, not only for himself, but for all
human rights.''
   Mandela's tour was being used to cement anti-apartheid actions
as well as raise funds for the ANC, of which Mandela is deputy
president. He was released from a South African jail four months
ago after serving 27 years for his activities on the ANC's behalf.
   The New York visit is expected to generate some $1.5 million,
said Suzanne DuBose, one of the mayor's financial advisers who is
handling fund-raising chores here.
   The city was still totaling how much of a strain Mandela's visit
would put on its already tight budget. Police overtime alone was
expected to cost $2 million, but Dinkins has said he expects the
State Department to pay that bill.
   Mandela is scheduled to leave for Boston early Saturday.

<TEXT>
   A candidate who appeared to have won the
Democratic primary for governor by a 32-vote margin asked the state
Supreme Court on Friday to block plans for a second recount of the
ballots.
   Candidate Ben Nelson asked the high court to certify him as his
party's candidate to challenge Republican incumbent Kay Orr in
November.
   Unofficial figures from recounts in the state's 93 counties
showed Nelson with a 32-vote lead over Bill Hoppner in the May 15
primary.
   Earlier this week, the State Board of Canvassers said there
should be a further recount of some ballots in 23 counties.
   On Friday, Nelson's attorneys asked the high court to take
jurisdiction from district court and order the State Board of
Canvassers to certify that Nelson won. They argued that the canvass
board failed to comply with its legal duty and certify the election
results submitted by the counties.
   Hoppner was on a fishing trip in Wyoming on Friday and
unavailable for comment.
   If the seven-member Supreme Court agreed to Nelson's request, it
would have to meet on or before the close of business Monday to
decide the question.
   The first recount was automatic because the contest was so
close. The second, partial recount sought by the state canvassing
board was expected to begin early next week.

   Lawmakers who defeated a proposed
constitutional amendment against burning the American flag are
bracing for a fierce fight on the campaign trail but say they sense
a change of heart among many voters.
   ``Something that folks loathe almost as much as flag burners is
politicians who demagogue, who wrap themselves in the flag for some
partisan votes,'' Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., said after the measure
failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority Thursday.
   Democratic lawmakers who voted against it told reporters they
detected a change among voters and said their mail is no longer
running so heavily in favor of the amendment.
   The House voted 254-177 for the measure, which President Bush
had been pressing since June 11, when the Supreme Court threw out
the 1989 Flag Protection Act as unconstitutional.
   However, the margin fell 34 votes short of the two-thirds needed
for approval of the amendment, which would pave the way for the
federal government and the states to ban burning or other
desecration of the American flag.
   Republicans voted 159-17 in favor of the amendment, while
Democrats were 160-95 against.
   The Senate remains committed to vote on the amendment before
leaving on a Fourth of July recess next week, but the House action
appeared to render that virtually meaningless. And Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., said there was no chance that the House would
return to the issue this year.
   Foley and other Democratic leaders campaigned hard against the
measure.
   The House action followed a day of emotional debate in which
more than 100 lawmakers paraded to the microphone to either praise
the amendment as protection for a national symbol and condemn it as
an attack on the Bill of Rights.
   Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., immediately renewed his
warning of earlier in the week that the battle will now move to the
campaign trail.
   ``I am absolutely confident that in those districts where the
member's values are clearly at variance with his district, where
you don't have a Hollywood-Greenwich Village-San Francisco kind of
value structure, that this will be a significant issue in debates
in October as candidates stand side by side,'' Gingrich told
reporters.
   Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., a chief sponsor of the
amendment, did not attend Gingrich's news conference but said in
debate that the issue was not a partisan one.
   Gingrich said he doubted if the flag-burning issue would be
decisive in any campaigns, but that in races where there is ``a
fight over values, it will be one more piece of evidence.''
   ``How can it avoid being a big political issue?'' he said. ``It
is a legitimate cultural values issue.''
   Critics portrayed their decision as a stand in favor of freedom
of speech despite warnings from Gingrich that their vote would be
used to inflame passions among Americans who grow emotional at the
sight of a burning flag.
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., said after the vote that ``there
were many individual acts of political courage on the floor.''
   ``Men and women have literally risked their political future on
behalf of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,'' he said.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., a leading critic of the amendment,
contended that despite recent public opinion polls that indicated
pro-amendment sentiment, voters are undergoing a change over heart
over the issue.
   Edwards said his mail was running as much as 30-1 against his
position a year ago but now is 50-1 in favor. ``The American people
are actually moving toward understanding better what they have in
the Bill of Rights every day,'' he said.
   Because he opposes the amendment, Jones said, his election
opponent is ``gleefully using it.'' But he said, ``It also seems to
me that I represent a district which is independent and thoughtful
and will make its decision in November based on a broad range of
considerations and a number of issues.''
   After the vote on the amendment, the House rejected, 236-179, a
narrowly drawn statute to punish people who burn flags to promote
violence or who burn flags on federal property or flags belonging
to the federal government.
   Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after GOP leaders
called it a political ``fig leaf'' to protect Democrats who opposed
the amendment.
   On the House floor, Michel said there was ``not a single phrase
in our amendment, not a single word ... suggesting this amendment
would or could lead to censorship of unpopular ideas by the
government.''
   Edwards, however, asked if the House would ``tell (visiting
South African black leader) Nelson Mandela next week ... that we've
had enough of unlimited free speech in this country? We don't trust
free speech anymore ... and last week we voted to cut back on it?''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Finish Work On Florio's Dramatic Tax and School Funding
Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to boost funding for poor and
middle-income schools at the expense of the wealthiest schools won
final approval Thursday in the state Assembly.
   The action came just two weeks after the state Supreme Court
ruled the system of school funding discriminated against children
in poor districts. New Jersey's system, dependent on the property
tax, is among a dozen that have been overturned by courts in recent
years.
   The Assembly vote on the proposal by Gov. Jim Florio on Thursday
morning followed all-night haggling and debate. The Assembly also
approved Florio's proposal for $2.8 billion in tax increases,
including income tax hikes for residents who make $35,000 a year or
more, and raises in sales, oil and tobacco taxes.
   The bills are now before Florio, who is expected to sign them
next week.
   The controversial school funding bill cleared the Assembly,
41-33, with just enough votes for passage. The state Senate passed
the school funding plan and income and sales tax increases about 15
hours earlier with the bare minimum 21 votes, all cast by Democrats.
   Higher income taxes will pump $1.1 billion more in state aid to
public schools, largely to poor and middle-income districts. Aid
will be sharply cut or eliminated to the wealthiest.
   The powerful teachers' lobby bitterly opposed the school funding
bill because it requires some wealthy districts to pay for pension
costs. The teachers representatives contend that shifting that cost
from the state endangers teachers' financial security.
   The state Supreme Court found the current school funding system
unconstitutional ordered that it be changed by the 1991-92 school
year. As in other states, schools in well-to-do areas were better
funded because local governments were able to collect more in
property taxes.
   Other states where courts have ordered changes in school funding
are Kentucky, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut,
Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   The 30 poorest school districts in the state would receive the
bulk of the new state aid, and about 350 suburban and rural
districts would also see more state money. At the same time, aid to
the 250 wealthiest districts would be reduced or abolished by 1995.
   Republicans bitterly opposed all the proposals. They charged the
school aid plan will decrease aid and raise property taxes in
middle class communities they represent.
   ``We don't need to penalize one set of school districts in order
to benefit another,'' said Assemblyman Robert Littell, R-Sussex.
   But Democrats said it was time to act before another generation
of youngsters from poor, urban communities is lost. They said that
while some districts will lose aid, there will be more state aid
for 73 percent of New Jersey's schoolchildren.
   ``This bill guarantees every child in this state will have a
quality education,'' said Assembly Speaker Joseph Doria, D-Hudson.
   Florio said he would take the package to the public, explaining
its benefits to property-tax payers and schoolchildren.
   ``This will not be a difficult thing for us to sell,'' he said.

<HEAD>City Officials Hope to Stem Rising Tide of Violence as Summer
Starts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the city's homicide rate up nearly 60 percent
during last year, officials hope beefed-up patrols, neighborhood
youth programs and an anti-gang task force can stem the violence of
summer.
   But with homicide rates on the rise in big cities like New York
and Dallas, no one is quite sure how to reduce the drug-related
gunplay and gang warfare on the streets as summer begins.
   ``It's troubling,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the Boston
Police Department, which reported 74 homicides so far this year,
compared with 51 from January to July 1 of 1989.
   In Boston, that means stepped-up police patrols in high-crime
areas like Roxbury and Dorchester, and the vigilance of a anti-gang
task force that has made 269 arrests of gang members since its
formation in March.
   The city's Safe Neighborhoods plan targets youth in the
inner-city by offering them hundreds of options to stay off the
streets.
   City officials, business and community leaders hope to guarantee
a summer job to every teen-ager who wants one. They also have
scheduled hundreds of activities, ranging from cookouts to
neighborhood clean-ups.
   More important is the city's decision to maintain the program
year-round, said Safe Neighborhoods' director Ted Landsmark.
   ``Violence went up last fall when folks went back to school so
we learned we have to keep it going all year,'' Landsmark said.
``We know it'll help during the summer and for the rest of the
year, too.''
   Federal drug czar William Bennett last week said anti-drug
efforts have caused a shortage of cocaine that could lead to
violence. ``There will be the same number of dogs fighting over a
smaller number of bones,'' Bennett said.
   In Texas, more than 150 elected Dallas-area officials, including
the mayor and chief of police, meet Friday to map an anti-crime
strategy for the summer.
   Dallas police, business and community leaders also instituted
``Project City,'' a program aimed at providing recreation and
employment for youth in the mostly black and Hispanic Oak Cliff
area.
   ``Historically we see a 10 to 15 percent increase in crime in
the summer and we like to do something about it beforehand,'' said
police Sgt. Jim Chandler. The homicide rate in Dallas is up 16
percent over last year.
   Chicago has added 50 officers to the police anti-crime unit for
the summer and has beefed up the narcotics unit.
   ``We can deal with the enforcement part but the jails are
overcrowded and people get out faster,'' said Tina Vicina, a
Chicago police spokeswoman. She said the 375 reported homicides in
Chicago is nearly even with last year's rate, but she said ``it
always gets worse in the summer.''
   In New York, where the homicide rate is up 29 percent over last
year, police aren't planning anything special for this summer.
   ``It's not good,'' said New York Police Det. Joseph McConville.
``We need more cops. But we got budgetary restraints. We'll just be
deploying officers where we think they're needed.''
   In Los Angeles, where 412 homicides were reported as of June 14,
compared with 386 for the same time last year, the police
department has announced no specific plans for the summer, said
Officer Don Lawrence.

   WHAT'S CHANGED:
   _Beaches are desegregated.
   _Inter-city trains no longer have carriages marked ``whites
only,'' but passengers can specify the race group with which they
wish to travel.
   _Hospitals are desegregated, but preference of admission to
white hospitals is given to members of the local community.
   _A law has been passed desegregating all public amenities such

   WHAT REMAINS:
   _The black majority has no vote in national affairs. Blacks can
vote only in tribal homelands and local black elections.
   _The Group Areas Act of 1950 mandates racial segregation of
residential areas.
   _The Black Land Act of 1913 prevents blacks from owning property
in the vast majority of the country.
   _The Population Registration Act of 1950 requires that all South
Africans be registered with the government by race. Without this
act, other apartheid laws would be difficult to enforce.
   _State-run schools are racially segregated.
   _Ambulance service is racially segregated.
   _Only white males are subjected to compulsory military
conscription.
   _Parents cannot adopt children of other races.
   _All judges are white.

   The durian is back in season and hawkers are
thinking up special names and twisting arms to sell a bumper crop
of the sweet but malodorous fruit.
   Calling the spiky green globe smelly does it injustice. It
stinks.
   Among the printable descriptions, one says it evokes ``rich
brimstone musk, whispering of depravity and month-old eggs. Durian
is to fruit what Limburger is to cheese and pornography is to
literature.''
   The stench allows no indifference: You love it or you leave the
neighborhood.
   No junk food, the much-loved, much-hated durian is high in
protein, carbohydrates and vitamins B and C. Experts say it thrives
in soil with a high sulfur content, which doubtless contributes to
its pungent odor.
   The telltale aroma now permeates sections of Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Durians ripen
twice a year, in December-January and June-July.
   They vary widely but many are about eight inches long and seven
inches wide. Durians weigh about 6{ pounds. The outer rind bristles
with tough thorns or ``duri'' which protect a creamy yellow-orange
pulp.
   The fruit is traditionally eaten raw after careful appraisal and
sharp bargaining by purists, who pride themselves on picking out
just the right one.
   That was more difficult this year as hard-sell tactics were used
by some Singapore vendors. Others tried to take the homely durian
up-market with designer labels.
   The police warned that strong-arm tactics would not be tolerated
after several shoppers complained they were intimidated by
aggressive fruit vendors. Durians are sold from outdoor stalls that
have a carnival atmosphere at night at the peak of the season.
``The best, the best, the very best from Malaysia!'' one hawker
chanted with the aplomb of a determined auctioneer.
   Other merchants try to turn top grade durians into something
special _ costlier anyway _ with names such as Lion Den and Tiger
Hill and XO. XO is on the label of some expensive cognacs.
   ``XO sounds expensive, like something with class. We want to
impress people,'' said Ben Teo, manager of Seh Sen Fruits. Imported
from neighboring Malaysia, XO boasts smoother texture and thicker
pulp, Teo said.
   While ordinary durians cost from $1.36 to $2.72 each, an XO
costs about $9 a pound.
   The bigger King XO fetches more than $27 a pound. The King has
smaller seeds than the ordinary XO and retains its smell longer,
Teo said.
   The powerful aroma is the perfume of prosperity for growers and
others in the trade. Wholesale prices vary widely according to
freshness, weight, shape and where they were grown, a market that
seems as delicately balanced as Wall Street.
   Related botanically to hibiscus, hollyhock, cotton and kapok,
durian is native to Malaysia and has been cultivated for centuries.
Unlike the shorter Thai plantation version, trees in Malaysia and
elsewhere are too lofty to harvest and the fruit crashes to the
ground when it is ripe.
   Fermentation that starts the moment it drops can change the
flavor perceptibly within hours. The fruit spoils within a week and
few will eat durian more than three days after they fall.
   Thailand is the biggest commercial grower, and old Asia hands
rate Thai durians as tops in consistency and flavor. The most
malodorous seem to be grown in the Philippines.
   Malaysian devotees regard it as a passion fruit capable of
stirring deep emotions. ``When the durians come down the sarongs go
up,'' according to local legend.

<HEAD>Halt In U.S.-PLO Talks Intensifies Pressure on Arafat</HEAD>

   President Bush's suspension of talks with
the PLO will strengthen the hand of Palestinian militants and
hard-line Arab states who oppose Yasser Arafat's peace effort. It
also will intensify growing anti-American sentiment.
   Bush's decision Wednesday to freeze the 18-month-old talks,
rather than break them off completely, has left the door open for
contacts to resume.
   But the breakdown raises the prospects of a resumption of
widescale terrorism at a time when passions in the Middle East are
flaring and moderate leaders are warning that a new Arab-Israeli
conflict may be looming.
   Bush suspended the talks because Arafat refused to condemn an
abortive guerrilla attack on Israel.
   The low-level dialogue began in December 1988 when the United
States ended a 13-year boycott following Arafat's renunciation of
terrorism and recognition of Israel's right to exist. It was seen
as a breakthrough in the tortuous Middle East peace process.
   But Palestinian leaders have become increasingly disillusioned
with Washington's inability to prod Israel into peace talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We'll not shed any tears over the U.S. decision,'' Arafat's
top lieutenant, Salah Khalaf, said in Tunis. ``The dialogue
produced no positive results.
   ``We recognized Israel. We did everything the Americans asked,
and Israel didn't give an inch,'' Khalaf said.
   ``The prospect of talking directly to the Americans may have
been the carrot that prompted Arafat ... to renounce terrorism and
explicitly recognize Israel, but ... the dialogue, or rather the
threat to break it off, has come to be seen by many Palestinians,
and not all of them radicals, as a stick brandished by the United
States to extract ever greater concessions from the PLO without
offering anything in return,'' veteran analyst Charles Snow wrote
in the Middle East Economic Survey a few days ago.
   The PLO leadership has not said what it will do. But Arafat's
peace initiative looks dead in the water along with the Bush
administration's effort to mediate a peace settlement.
   Saeed Kamel, the top PLO official in Cairo, said Thursday: ``The
Palestinian leadership is currently considering options to press
forward toward peace. This will be unveiled in the coming weeks.''
   He refused to elaborate. But his statement indicated Arafat is
not about to reverse course and opt for all-out violence.
   A government official in Cairo, which has mediated between
Israel and the United States, said Egypt will support Arafat and
his moderate policy and curb the Palestinian militants.
   Arafat said recently that if his peace effort failed, he would
call a meeting of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, submit his resignation as PLO chairman and say
``I am returning your mandate.''
   Kamel's statement appeared to indicate this point has not been
reached.
   However, it is unlikely that Arafat will bow to U.S. demands
that he discipline Mohammad Abass, maverick leader of the Palestine
Liberation Front, for launching the May 30 attack and dismiss him
from the PLO's ruling executive committee.
   Arafat insists that only the Palestine National Council can
dismiss Abass from the PLO's executive committee.
   With the dialogue suspended, Arafat may feel even less inclined
to punish Abass, whose small faction is part of the PLO. If he did
crack down on Abass, he risks alienating the PLO's radicals and
triggering widespread defections.
   There has been no indication so far that Arafat will respond to
the U.S. decision by unleashing his guerrillas against Israel again.
   But there is always the risk that the militants will take
matters into their own hands. With the dialogue on the rocks, they
no longer believe there is anything to lose.
   Despite the efforts of leaders like King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, moderation is in short supply
in the Arab world these days.
   Anti-American feeling is growing because of what many Arabs see
as Washington's political, military and economic support for Israel.
   A long-time moderate figure in Jordan, former foreign minister
Taher Masri said recently the Americans are ``too cowardly to do
anything.''
   The State Department on Thursday urged Americans traveling to
the Middle East and elsewhere to exercise ``extra caution.''
   The Arabs also blame the Americans for doing nothing to prevent
a wave of immigration to Israel by Soviet Jews. Israeli officials
expect 150,000 by the end of the year and say up to 1 million will
seek to settle in the Jewish state in the next few years.
   The Arabs fear many will settle in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza, land proclaimed an independent Palestinian state, pushing out
large numbers of Palestinians.
   The PLO is losing support in the occupied zones to the extremist
Islamic fundamentalists of the Gaza-based Hamas group who advocate
an all-out struggle against Israel.
   Arafat's credibility in the occupied territories, where
Palestinians have been waging an uprising for the last 30 months,
is likely to be eroded further because of his failure to achieve a
political breakthrough. The prospect of that is now more remote
than ever.
   Khalaf warned last month that the PLO leaders ``run the risk of
becoming generals without troops.''
   Arafat's critics stress that the uprising has neither persuaded
the Israelis to relinquish the West Bank and Gaza nor persuaded
them to consider peace talks with the PLO.
   In this climate of uncertainty and frustration, coupled with a
buildup of long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction,
what happens in the next few weeks will be crucial.

<HEAD>New AIDS Treatments Promise To Be Better, Safer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New AIDS treatments emerging from the National
Institutes of Health promise to be as good as existing treatments
but without many of the severe side effects, new studies show.
   Existing treatments revolving around the drug AZT may soon be
replaced by combinations of drugs that can kill the AIDS virus
without the damage to the blood-producing bone marrow often caused
by AZT, researchers said Thursday at the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS.
   The world's largest meeting on AIDS continued to be the target
of demonstrations. Several hundred demonstrators marched to City
Hall and about 50 were arrested when they blocked traffic in a
nearby intersection.
   An AIDS-infected doctor who delivered a moving talk to the
conference on discrimination against AIDS patients said that the
Johns Hopkins University medical school had taken the unusual step
of seeking a court injunction to bar his speech.
   Dr. Hacib Aoun, who contracted AIDS from a patient's blood in
1983 while in training at Hopkins, was forced to sue Hopkins to get
medical coverage, he said.
   The 1987 settlement of the suit was kept secret, and a Hopkins
spokeswoman said the institution was trying to be sure Aoun did not
violate that secrecy.
   The following were among the meeting's highlights:
   _ Tests by Dr. Gary Richwald and colleagues at UCLA of 246
prostitutes in a legal Nevada brothel found that none had acquired
an AIDS infection since 1986. That was the year the state made use
of condoms mandatory in its 35 legal brothels.
   ``Along about 1985, when the AIDS epidemic really hit and was a
news item, I really serious thought that perhaps the party was
over,'' said Russell Reade, co-owner of the Chicken Ranch in
Pahrump, Nev. ``I was pleasantly surprised that business
increased.''
   _ Ten years into the AIDS epidemic, some gay men are relapsing
into unsafe sexual practices that could lead to an even larger
second wave of deadly infection, researchers said.
   Maggie Reinfeld of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City
said the organization has established an educational and
advertising campaign to combat that. ``Safer sex gets a lot tougher
when you have to live with it your whole life,'' she said.
   _ More than 1 million African children who are not infected with
the AIDS virus have AIDS-infected mothers and are likely to become
orphans, said Eunice Kiereini of the World Health Organization.
Fifty percent of Africa's AIDS cases are in women, she said.
   Aoun's speech about AIDS discrimination included the charge that
Johns Hopkins had discriminated against him by failing to renew his
contract and trying to deny him health benefits. He did not mention
the institution by name, however.
   Paul Rosenberg, vice president and general counsel for the Johns
Hopkins medical school and hospital in Baltimore, said, ``We did in
fact seek guidance of a court with respect to Dr. Aoun's speech.''
He responded to Aoun's charges through a statement released by a
Hopkins spokeswoman.
   Hopkins also contacted the conference's program director to try
to get an advance copy of Aoun's speech. The program director, Dr.
Robert Wachter of the University of California, San Francisco,
wrote back to Hopkins to say that he didn't have a copy.
   ``It wasn't to prevent him from speaking,'' Rosenberg said. ``We
actually wanted to see his speech.''
   The studies of new AIDS treatments mostly dealt with drugs of
the same class as AZT, such as one called ddI and another called
ddC.
   ``We clearly need alternatives to AZT,'' said Dr. Thomas Merigan
of Stanford University. He was one of six researchers who described
experiments with the new drugs. He noted that patients react
differently to the drugs and said that ddC, for example, ``would be
especially useful for patients who have trouble with ddI or AZT.''
   While studies using combinations of the drugs look promising, it
is too early yet to begin widespread use of such combination
treatments, the researchers said.
   Continuing studies with AZT now suggest that the drug is best if
given as soon as possible after diagnosis of infection with the
AIDS virus, said Dr. Margaret Fischl of the University of Miami.
   She presented the strongest evidence yet that use of AZT early
in infection can significantly slow development of life-threatening
illness.

<HEAD>New President Willing To Try Military Officers For Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin says he would
allow the trial and punishment of any military officer, including
ex-President Augusto Pinochet, on human rights abuse charges if the
courts find legal grounds.
   ``The decisions of the courts will be complied with,'' Aylwin
told a news conference Thursday on his 100th day in office.
   There has been speculation the government will eventually decree
a pardon or amnesty. Aylwin's statements on Thursday appeared to
rule that out, although he said often ``justice is out of reach''
because of the time that has elapsed.
   Since Chile's return to democracy, authorities have found two
mass graves believed used by the army after a 1973 coup led by Gen.
Pinochet. In all, 23 bodies were unearthed, but 700 suspected
leftists who disappeared during military rule remain missing.
   Aylwin, who replaced Pinochet in March after winning free
elections, said he and his defense minister asked top military
authorities for information on any other hidden graves.
   ``The answer I received is that there is willingness to
cooperate on the matter, but that the high commands don't know
where these places really are,'' he said.
   Among the missing were more than 100 people summarily executed
by special military-led tribunals after the coup, according to
human rights organizations. The victims' families were notified of
the executions, but the bodies were not handed over. Most of the
other missing people also were believed to have been in military or
police custody.
   Aylwin has said he plans to pursue a reconciliation of civilians
and the military and that a special investigation launched by his
administration into human rights abuse would conclude with ``a time
for forgiveness.''
   Pinochet led a September 1973 military takeover that toppled an
elected leftist government.
   After 16 years of authoritarian leadership, on March 11 he
handed over the presidency but remained commander of the
60,000-member army. A constitutional clause bars Aylwin from
replacing him.
   While in power, Pinochet decreed an amnesty for atrocities
committed from the coup through March 1978.
   Aylwin questioned the validity of the decree, citing
international treaties that require Chile to respect human rights.
He said some jurists believe the treaties supercede any amnesties,
and can be applied retroactively.
   Aylwin also took issue with a recent army declaration that
called the atrocities the inevitable result of ``an internal war''
between the armed forces and militant leftists.
   Within three days of the takeover, Aylwin said, ``they (the
military) had the country under control. They can't cite a state of
war to justify excesses, abuse and human rights violations.''
   ``Even in states of war, some basic rules have to be
respected,'' he said.
   Despite clashes between the military and the government on the
human rights issue, Aylwin categorically rejected the possibility
of a coup.
   He said the military ``have made clear their loyal desire to
obey the constitution and the law'' while his government plans ``to
respect the institution of the armed forces.''
   He said he was trying ``to build as frank and as positive a
relationship as possible'' with Pinochet.

<HEAD>Corrections Officials Injure 16 Inmates After Scuffle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prison guards fired shotguns to quell a
racially motivated melee among 100 prisoners Thursday, wounding 16
inmates, officials said.
   The guards at the minimum-security Cimarron Unit at Arizona
State Prison fired shotguns into the ground after a warning shot
and tear gas failed to end the disturbance, said corrections
spokesman Mike Dominiak. The injuries were from ricocheting
pellets, he said.
   Eight of the injured were treated at area hospitals and eight
others were treated at the prison, Dominiak said. He was unable to
say how badly they were hurt. No guards were injured.
   The incident started about 5 p.m. with rock throwing between
blacks and Hispanics in a crowd of about 100 inmates, the spokesman
said. White inmates joined in, siding with the Hispanics and guards
moved in to try to break up the fight.
   Dominiak said a guard lieutenant ordered a shot fired into the
air and then tear gas fired into the crowd of fighting inmates, but
both measures failed to stop the fight.
   He said guards fired into the crowd of inmates only after the
group began to advance in what he described as a ``threatening
way'' toward the guards.
   Part of the unit was locked down and guards late Thursday were
working to return all prisoners to their cells, Dominiak said.

   Mayor Maynard Jackson has refused to post a
$1,000 bond to get his son out of jail.
   The bond would free Jackson's younger son, Maynard H. Jackson
III, 19, pending an appeal of a disorderly conduct conviction.
   The mayor said at a news conference Thursday he would not post
the bond and wouldn't say why not.
   The mayor's son is serving a 45-day sentence after being
convicted Tuesday in Atlanta Municipal Court on a charge stemming
from a Monday incident in which a sheriff's deputy watched him
throw his girlfriend to the ground.
   Jackson has been arrested three times this year and was
frequently the center of noise complaints during February at the
home of his girlfriend, Maria Norma Duarte, 30, police said.
   He is in the Atlanta Corrections Center, ``being treated
identically as all other inmates,'' said Tom Pocock, acting
corrections office director.

<HEAD>Cold War Over, Says House Panel in Seeking to Shift Aid Focus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declaring the Cold War over, a House committee
is pushing a $15.8 billion foreign aid bill that begins shifting
the emphasis in America's help from military toward more economic
aid.
   ``The West has won the Cold War, and we have a right to say
so!'' the Appropriations Committee trumpeted in its report on the
1991 aid measure, approved Thursday on a voice vote.
   The march toward democracy and free markets in Eastern Europe
and elsewhere brings Congress ``face to face with the
responsibility to reshape our foreign assistance budget,'' the
Democratic-run committee said, harshly criticizing President Bush
for drafting ``a sleepwalker's budget.''
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., foreign aid subcommittee chairman,
called Bush's request for $5 billion in military aid, an increase
of $300 million over the current level, ``particularly quaint,
given the changes in the world.'' Instead, the panel approved just
over $4.6 billion in military aid to friends and allies around the
globe.
   Obey mapped out a five-year agenda for changing the emphasis of
U.S. aid, beginning this year with a shift of $400 million from
military aid into programs for refugees, children and economic
development for Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
   He had sought even deeper cuts, but was forced to add back $144
million to the military aid account to buy at least the temporary
support of the administration and Republican lawmakers when the
bill goes to the full House next week.
   There will be plenty of other fights on the bill, including
battles over U.S. aid to El Salvador, to Cambodian rebels and to
international population control agencies. The bill remains subject
to further change when it goes to the Senate.
   On the most difficult issue, El Salvador, the bill would
withhold half of next year's expected $85 million in military aid.
The fate of the money would depend on progress in peace talks
between the government and leftist rebels who have waged a 10-year
civil war.
   If the FMLN rebels were to mount a major military offensive or
abandon peace discussions, the government's military aid would be
restored; if the Salvadoran government were to take such action, it
would lose the remaining half of its aid.
   The assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere,
Bernard Aronson, met late Thursday with key lawmakers of both
parties to begin forging a compromise bipartisan policy toward El
Salvador that could be substituted for that part of the bill.
   Aronson brought a counterproposal to the meeting, calling for
similar conditions on the U.S. aid money but restricting a smaller
portion of it, perhaps 25 to 30 percent. Democrats, however, were
coming under pressure from liberal members to hold the line and
make no concessions to the administration.
   To win GOP support for the package, Obey also agreed to provide
$50 million for the World Bank, just less than half of what Bush
had asked. Obey has fought what he sees as the practice of giving
money to international lenders that ends up going to bail out large
commercial banks from loans made to Third World countries.
   And in another concession to the White House, the Appropriations
Committee agreed to raise aid ceilings for three countries that
host U.S. military bases.
   Turkey would get $430 million, up $30 million from the earlier
version of the bill; Greece would be increased from $280 million to
$301 million; and Portugal would go from $90 million to $95
million. All remained substantially below current-year levels.
   Another fight loomed over a section barring any aid to the
non-communist resistance coalition in Cambodia that includes the
Khmer Rouge, the group believed to have massacred about 1 million
people when it ruled Cambodia in the 1970s.
   About $7 million a year in U.S. humanitarian aid now flows to
the resistance coalition, which is fighting the
Vietnamese-installed government of Cambodia. The United States
supports the faction of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and provides aid
even though some of it finds its way to the Khmer Rouge, the
militarily strongest part of the coalition.

<HEAD>Farm Families Depend on the Supermarket Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1910, it was an ordinary summer event in
the preparation of dinner on the farm _ the noon meal _ for a
chicken to be caught, its neck wrung and then dressed, cut up and
plunked in the frying pan.
   Today, descendants of the 1910 family, if they still are
farmers, shop at supermarkets, often for the same convenient items
enjoyed by city families.
   There is still a significant amount of home butchering,
vegetable growing and other use of farm-grown products. But not
like it was when automobiles and airplanes were new, when horses
and muscle-power were the prime movers.
   A new report by the Agriculture Department tells in stark,
unemotional numbers what has happened.
   For example, in 1910, the estimated value of ``home
consumption'' by farm families _ items, mostly food, that are
produced themselves _ was $1.27 billion. In 1988, the value of
those items was $810 million.
   The figures are not adjusted for inflation, so a few more
comparisons may help. And keep in mind that the number of farmers
has dropped sharply in the past 80 years.
   According to USDA records, there were 32 million people living
on 6.36 million farms in 1910. The 1988 tally was 4.95 million
people living on fewer than 2.2 million farms.
   In 1910, farmers sold about $5.78 billion worth of products. In
other words, the value of ``cash marketings'' that year was only
4.5 times as great as the $1.27 billion value of home consumption.
   But in 1988, cash marketings totaled more than $151.4 billion,
or nearly 187 times larger than home consumption reported at $810
million.
   ``There has been a decrease in the number of farm families, and
there's more prepared food that people can buy outside the farm,''
said Cheryl D. Johnson of the department's Economic Research
Service, the report's author.
   At the same time, she said Thursday in a telephone interview,
farm production has increased, while total ``input'' items used by
farmers to produce crops and livestock has generally declined.
   In other words, farmers today are actually ``producing more with
less'' than they were before World War I, Johnson said.
   The report's section on productivity used 1977 as a base year
for comparison. In 1910, the output of crops was 42 percent of the
base. Although 1988 was a drought year of severely damaged crops,
production was still 92 percent. The record was 118 percent in 1985.
   Livestock production in 1910 was 39 percent, compared with 115
percent in 1988, the record high.
   On the input side, farmers purchased only 32 percent of the
items needed to produce in 1910, compared with the 1977 base year
of 100 percent, while their ``non-purchased items'' were reported
at 175 percent.
   In 1988, farmers purchased 92 percent of what they bought in
1977, reflecting the downturn in the farm economy since the late
1970s and early 1980s when the purchased inputs peaked.
   Non-purchased inputs in 1988 were reported at 78 percent of the
1977 base, representing a part of the general downturn since the
early 1930s, a period when mechanization, chemicals, hybrid seeds
and scores of other items finally crowded out the homespun
environment of the American farmer.
   The peak year for the use of non-purchased items, incidentally,
was 1920, when those represented 198 percent of the 1977 base year.
In 1932, those still totaled 191 percent but dropped rapidly after
that.

   James Cason, who was rejected last year by the
Senate for a top job in the Agriculture Department, is working as
deputy manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corp.
   Cason, 35, asked the White House last November to withdraw his
nomination as assistant secretary for natural resources and the
environment.
   Cason's withdrawal effectively ended an eight-month battle
between President Bush and environmentalists, who were supported by
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee.
   Opposition was led by the Sierra Club, National Wildlife
Federation, Wilderness Society, League of Conservation Voters and
National Audubon Society.
   The groups alleged Cason's record in several top Interior
Department positions during the Reagan administration showed
favoritism toward development of public lands, despite
environmental concerns.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who cleared Cason for the
new $79,200-a-year USDA job, had strongly supported the nomination
and had characterized the opposition as ``both misguided and
unfair.''
   The Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which provides subsidized
insurance to farmers to help protect them from losses due to
drought and other natural disasters, said Thursday that Cason
joined the agency on May 6.

   In this day and age, when countries argue less
and cooperate more, when armies are trimmed and East-West divisions
erased, the Arab-Israeli conflict stands out as an anomaly.
   The prospects for a settlement are at another low point. Some
people are talking openly about the possibility of yet another war
in the region. It is the only major conflict in the world in which
there is no serious peace process under way.
   Palestinians have an understandable desire to have a nation of
their own. Israelis have an equally understandable yearning to be
free from external threat. Palestinians feel oppressed. Israelis
feel insecure.
   Mistrust is everywhere. The fledgling U.S. dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization has lapsed while still in its
infancy, victim of an abortive terrorist raid near Tel Aviv that
the PLO leadership refused to repudiate.
   President Bush's decision to scuttle the dialogue won plaudits
in Jerusalem. Still, the U.S.-Israeli dialogue is about as
corrosive now as it has been at any time since the early Carter
years.
   The contrast with the situation elsewhere on the globe could not
be greater. Perhaps for the first time, the Soviet Union has a
leader almost universally regarded as a man of peace. There is now
even talk of Western economic aid for the Kremlin.
   In Europe, it's doubtful that the people of that continent have
ever gotten along better than they do now. The main agenda item
this week is German reunification. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III is in Berlin for those discussions.
   In the post World War II era, Baker, more than any of his
predecessors, has had the luxury of being able to reconcile old
conflicts as opposed to confronting new ones. Consider the remark a
generation ago of Secretary of State Dean Rusk: ``When I'm asleep,
two-thirds of the rest of the world is awake stirring up trouble.''
Baker sleeps easier than Rusk did.
   Just this past Monday, Baker concluded a visit to Guatemala,
where five Central American presidents talked about integrating
their economies. It was the first time these presidents got
together to talk about managing peace instead of war.
   Much of the wariness of U.S.-Mexican relations has dissipated of
late. With luck and hard work, the once unthinkable notion of a
free trade agreement will be a reality in a couple of years. The
idea of a free trade zone in the Caribbean also is gaining
momentum. A decade ago, that region seemed ripe for ideological
conflict.
   The tensions in southern Africa seem tamer than before. Cubans
are leaving Angola and the South African government has taken long
strides toward ending its status as a pariah state. The tumultuous
reception being given to former prisoner Nelson Mandela on his U.S.
visit demonstrates how deeply rooted the concept of equal rights
under law has become.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk has yet to dismantle some
of the most objectionable aspects of apartheid, such as the
restrictions on where blacks can live.
   But South Africans can take some encouragement from the peaceful
evolution to democracy in Namibia, a former South African colony
where the white minority lorded it over the black majority for
decades. Amid the hubbub over Mandela, Namibia's president, Sam
Nujoma, passed through Washington on Monday almost unnoticed.
   Mandela seems to be on everybody's most admired list these days
with the exception of some worried whites back home. Not the least
of his feats has been the ability in his travels to charm both
Palestinians and Jews, one of the few things both groups have been
able to agree on.

   Little Richard, usually never at a loss for
words, choked up when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame.
   The flamboyant rock idol and lay evangelist wore dark sunglasses
and an all-black outfit Thursday, when he was greeted by hundreds
of shouting well-wishers at a ceremony.
   He lost his composure moments after he was introduced. With his
face hidden in his hand, he took about a minute to recover.
   ``I just want to say I'm really grateful to be here. I've been
waiting a long time,'' he said.
   Little Richard, 57, whose real name is Richard Wayne Penniman,
became a legend with such hits as ``Tutti Frutti,'' ``Lucille'' and
``Good Golly Miss Molly.''
   He also has appeared on television and in movies, including
``Down and Out in Beverly Hills.''

   Isiah Thomas couldn't resist a little Dan
Quayle bashing during a trip to the White House with his fellow
Detroit Pistons.
   Thomas, most valuable player in the NBA finals, poked fun at the
vice president during a ceremony Thursday for showing up at two of
the team's worst games all year.
   ``Thanks for all your support,'' Thomas said. Quayle grinned and
waved his arms in protest.
   President Bush paid tribute to the Pistons for their second
consecutive championship victory. The team got to go to the White
House the first time, too.
   ``I think they're going to have to give us a wing,'' Thomas
said. ``They have an East Wing and a West Wing, Now they'll have a
Piston Wing.''
   Bush got a few good-hearted licks in during a Rose Garden
ceremony.
   Bush called Piston bad boy Bill Laimbeer ``my old friend Mr.
Congeniality.''

   A model and a boxing promoter
have been accused of attempting to extort money from the father of
tennis star Steffi Graf, newspapers have reported.
   Nicole Meissner, 22, allegedly tried to extort $295,000 from
Peter Graf, claiming that he fathered her child born in January,
the West German newspaper Bild quoted a Frankfurt prosecutor as
saying.
   Meissner and boxing promoter Eberhard Thurst were arrested
Tuesday at a Frankfurt airport, the newspaper Berliner Morgenpost
said.
   Bild said Meissner later withdrew the allegations after an
investigation was launched. The two remained in custody Thursday,
pending the outcome of the investigation.
   Graf, 21, who is from West Germany, is the world's No. 1 player.

   David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the designers who
soared to fame with the wedding dress they created for Princess Di,
are ending their marriage and their professional relationship.
   British newspapers reported Thursday that Elizabeth will
continue to design under the Emanuel label and wants to launch a
ready-to-wear collection, while David wants to start his own
couture label and hopes to expand his interest in photography.
   A statement issued by the couple Wednesday night said only: ``In
due course we will announce our individual plans for the future.''
   The commission to make Diana's dress for her 1981 wedding to
Prince Charles made the Emanuels household names. They amassed an
array of celebrity clients.

   Home writer Martha Stewart has angered
some in her hometown for refusing to disclose how much she raised
for charity through a benefit decorator show house.
   The show house was open for 20 days last month to benefit the
Hole in the Wall Gang Camp Fund, a charity for seriously ill
children and their families founded by Stewart's Westport neighbor,
Paul Newman.
   The show house and other events raised $210,000 for the charity,
Stewart told The Advocate of Stamford. But she won't say how much
was raised specifically through the show house.
   About 9,000 people visited the show house for $15 each, which
would make the gross proceeds $135,000. Stewart said the show house
turned a profit for the camp, but that volunteers and visitors
don't have a right to know what it is.
   ``I don't think we should give the dollar amount,'' Stewart
said. ``They all got $15 worth of information out of that house.
Think of it this way: It's like going to the movies.''
   Stewart has written several books on home decorating. She is a
lifestyle consultant for K mart Corp. and plans to launch a how-to
home magazine Nov. 15 with backing from Time-Warner Inc.

   The first time Richard Nixon saw
Pat Ryan, she turned him down for a date. But he boldly predicted
that one day they would marry.
   On Thursday, the former president and his wife celebrated their
50th wedding anniversary, surrounded by their children and
grandchildren.
   There was nothing grandiose about it, just a family gathering at
the Nixon home tucked away in the woods. Nixon celebrations are
usually low-key and private.
   On this occasion, they allowed an Associated Press reporter and
photographer to visit, providing a rare glimpse of the former first
lady who has been out of public view since Nixon resigned from the
White House in 1974.
   Despite illnesses over the years, including a major stroke in
1976 and a mild one in 1983, Mrs. Nixon looked well, still slender
and wearing her blond hair in much the style it was in the White
House. She walked unaided, carried on a genial conversation and
smiled readily for the camera.
   The Nixons' two grandsons and two granddaughters cavorted around
while the golden anniversary picture was taken. A few minutes
later, relieved of having to pose any more, two of the children
were in bathing suits and splashing in the pool.
   The Nixons allowed the outsiders to visit only on ground rules
that their remarks were not to be published.
   They usually celebrate special occasions with only their
immediate family, Edward and Tricia Cox and their son, Christopher,
11; and David and Julie Eisenhower and their children: Jennie, 11;
Alex, 9; and Melanie, 6.
   The pictures were made in the woodsy panorama that extends from
the back of the Nixon house _ down from a natural deck, past the
garden that Mrs. Nixon tends, past the swimming pool where the
former president swims laps each evening, to the tennis court used
most often for basketball practice by the two grandsons.
   Mrs. Nixon wore a pink and white Adele Simpson suit for the
anniversary portrait. Her daughters said the suit was a favorite
from the White House years.
   The former president and his wife will move soon to a town house
in Park Ridge, about a mile away to escape the burden of caring for
a four-acre estate.
   The Nixons met in Whittier, Calif., in 1938 at the casting
tryouts for ``The Dark Tower,'' a play by George S. Kaufman and
Alexander Woollcott.
   ``I thought I knew everyone in Whittier, but that night a
beautiful and vivacious young woman with titian hair appeared whom
I had never seen before,'' Nixon said in his memoirs. ``I found I
could not take my eyes away from her. For me it was a case of love
at first sight.'' He got the part of Barry Jones and she played
Daphne Martin.
   ``I got a friend to introduce us and then offered them both a
ride home,'' said Nixon. ``On the way I asked Pat if she would like
a date with me. She said, `I'm very busy.' I said, `You shouldn't
say that because someday I'm going to marry you.'''
   Nixon was then a young partner in the law firm of Wingert,
Bewley and Nixon and Pat taught business courses at Whittier High
School for $190 a month. They were married on June 21, 1940, in
what he describes as ``a small family ceremony'' at the Mission Inn
in Riverside, and honeymooned in Mexico.
   Pat was the name she substituted for the name she was born with
and disliked, Thelma Catherine.
   Mrs. Nixon has consistently been on lists of America's most
admired women even though she is seldom seen. Her husband has
emerged as a prolific commentator on world events and a political
prognosticator. He has written eight books, seven since the
presidency.
   Although Mrs. Nixon's 1976 stroke left one side paralyzed, she
recovered fully. Her health, however, has been fragile and she has
been hospitalized several times.
   In a biography of her mother, Julie said the first stroke came
on the day her mother read ``The Final Days'' _ the Bob Woodward
and Carl Bernstein account of Nixon's resignation.
   ``For mother, the most unbearable part of the book was the
analysis of her marriage as loveless,'' Mrs. Eisenhower wrote. And
she said of her parents' marriage:
   ``Together they traveled far, but by a turn of fate, most of
their journey was taken in the public eye. ... The political road
was not easy for one who had always valued her privacy and
independence.''

<HEAD>Homeless Advocates Turn to Coupons to Break the Spare Change Habit</HEAD>

   The Center Cafe seems like many other
restaurants. There's piped-in music, white tableclothes and vases
with yellow carnations.
   It is different. Mike, who is homeless, is welcome there with a
coupon someone handed him on the street.
   ``I don't know who he was. Just some dude give me this coupon.
So I came in,'' he said as he poked at a helping of cole slaw
during a recent lunch.
   ``This food is pretty good.''
   Mike got his hot meal through a food coupon program on Skid Row
designed to give people an alternative to handing out spare change
that may go for cheap wine or drugs instead of food.
   Houston has a similar program and one is planned for the fall in
Philadelphia using tokens.
   The Los Angeles program is operated by the Weingart Foundation,
which runs a health clinic, housing programs and offers drug and
rehabilitation from the Weingart Center near the cafe on Skid Row.
   ``We needed a way to help people deal with panhandlers and that
uncomfortable situation people run across every day of not knowing
what to do when people are asking for money,'' said Elizabeth
Bailey, Weingart's vice president of development and public
relations.
   The program, which is considered a model, was started in March
1989. Since then, 22,000 of the coupons have been distributed.
   Besides hot meals, the recipients are encouraged to use other
Weingart services.
   Many of the coupons are purchased by businesses, which hand them
out to employees to use when approached on the street for money.
Some companies buy a batch of coupons and give them back to
Weingart to help the foundation raise money.
   The cafe, set up by Weingart to purposely not look like a soup
kitchen, also serves free meals to people in other Weingart
programs and offers meals at a low cost to people who stroll in off
the street.
   Despite the success, the plan has some drawbacks.
   The coupons can only be redeemed at the cafe. Giving them to
homeless people elsewhere in the sprawling city would do little
good because they might never get to the Skid Row cafe.
   The program doesn't prevent people from buying drugs or alcohol
by selling the coupons on the street, where they are said to be
worth $1.50.
   Still, homeless advocates see the coupon program as one of the
better ways to help both the homeless and those who are approached
by panhandlers.
   ``People feel a little better about giving a homeless person a
ticket if they know that it is being used for something good,''
said Steve Bryant, operations director of the Search Homeless
Project, which started the food program in Houston.
   The Los Angeles cafe offers a different main dish each day to
the holders of coupons, but they have a choice of side dishes
offered up on steam tables. A breakfast of bacon and eggs is
available to people without coupons for less than $1.
   Many of the cafe's customers don't have coupons and pay the low
price for meals.
   In Philadelphia, businesses and homeless advocates are gearing
up for a food token program in the fall. Organizers hope to sell
tokens in local stores with window stickers advertising token
outlets.
   The tokens will be good for meals in dining rooms to be set up.
   ``The whole thrust of the program is to get the panhandlers up
off the street,'' said Nancy Gold, head of the token program.
``When people give them money, what they're doing is supporting
them staying there.''

   Democrats, unable to override President Bush's
veto of a bill to let federal workers join political campaigns, now
want to extend the ban to Bush's Cabinet and hundreds of other
presidential appointees.
   ``What's good for the goose is good for the gander,'' Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., said in introducing the new bill Thursday. Earlier,
the Senate failed by two votes to override Bush' veto of the
legislation to broaden federal workers' political rights.
   Pryor's new bill would extend the 1939 Hatch Act's ban on
federal workers' political activities to the more than 350
employees on the White House payroll and another 600 presidential
appointees.
   In vetoing the earlier bill Friday, Bush said that allowing
federal workers to participate in campaigns ``would inevitably lead
to repoliticizing the federal work force'' and ``destroy its
essential political neutrality.''
   ``If that's your big concern ... stop appointing those
ambassadors who simply gave $100,000 to the Republican Committee,''
said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., who with Rep. William Clay,
D-Mo., introduced Pryor's bill in the House. ``Over the last dozen
years, the number of political appointees in the federal work force
has increased almost 60 percent.''
   The Senate override attempt failed on a 65-35 vote, with three
Republican supporters switching their votes to deny the needed
two-thirds majority. All 55 Democrats voted to override.
   When the bill was passed by the Senate in May with a potentially
veto-overriding 67-30 majority, 13 Republicans had supported it.
Reversing their earlier votes Thursday were Sens. Alfonse D'Amato
of New York, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Trent Lott of
Mississippi.
   The White House also picked up the support of Republican Sens.
Pete Wilson of California and Kit Bond of Missouri. Both had missed
the vote in May.
   The House, with nearly half of its Republicans bolting the
administration, voted 327-93 Wednesday to override Bush's veto _ 46
votes more than needed.
   Democrats attributed the Senate loss to White House pressure on
Republicans to maintain Bush's perfect record of overpowering
Congress in all 11 previous veto showdowns his first 17 months in
office.
   ``All of us regret that the merits of this struggle were
overshadowed by partisan appeals to preserve the president's
unbroken string of consecutive vetoes sustained by Congress,'' Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said.
   The closest Bush has come to losing a veto override was last
July, when 34 senators by a single vote upheld his veto of a bill
to impose conditions on his sale of FSX jet fighter technology to
Japan.
   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas offered another explanation
for the vote switch: Democratic desires to bolster the political
action committees of federal employee unions, which funneled 88
percent of their campaign contributions in the 1988 election to
Democrats.
   ``The PAC heads of the Letter Carriers and others (unions) want
more power to raise more money to give to Democrats,'' Dole said.
``That's how it works around here: Money is power.''
   The legislation would have allowed 3 million federal and postal
workers, for the first time in 51 years, to attend political
conventions and caucuses as delegates _ on their own time _ and
speak at rallies on behalf of candidates.
   It also would have removed a ban on government workers holding
offices in local, state or national political organizations or
soliciting donations from co-workers for federal employee and
postal union political action committees.
   Federal workers, however, still would have been prohibited from
taking leaves of absence to seek elected public office or
soliciting campaign contributions from the general public or on
behalf of a specific candidate.
   In introducing his bill, Pryor said that under current law, ``A
federal employee who cannot stuff envelopes of his own volition
can, in effect, be required to write a partisan political speech
for his boss, the agency head.''

   Outside the door, a red light shines to show
the Navy's emergency coordination center is at work. Inside, the
names of the dead and wounded from the fire and explosion aboard
the USS Midway are printed on a white board for all to see.
   The names of the dead are highlighted in blue.
   Hunched over rows of telephones, scribbling names and phone
numbers, some 20 Navy officers and enlisted men and women speak
calmly to frantic relatives unsure about their loved ones half a
world away.
   ``May I have your son's name? Do you know his Social Security
number?'' a young officer asks.
   She pauses, searches the board in front of her, and offers the
best news a worried mother could hear: ``Ma'am, his name is not on
the list.''
   In the first 30 hours after the center opened, the Navy logged
more than 6,100 calls from friends and family concerned about the
4,500 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier stricken in the ocean off
Japan on Wednesday.
   Even after the fire that broke out deep inside the huge ship was
put out and news reports about the incident abated, the calls
continued to pour in.
   As the other services do in such times of tragedy, the Navy
geared up its phone bank in the basement of the Navy Annex on a
hill above the Pentagon soon after the Midway fire broke out.
   ``We just grabbed people out of the hall,'' to staff the first
calls coming in, said Rear Adm. Frank Gallo, who heads the Naval
Personnel Command and is in charge of the center. ``We've got a lot
of good people _ they pitch in and help and do what needs to be
done.''
   One volunteer who helped take calls, Lt. Synthia Jones of
Daphne, Ala., said she was just as nervous as some of the callers.
   ``Then I thought, if it were my family, how would I treat them?
... They were comforted, just to know they could talk to someone,''
she said.
   Petty Officer James Newsham said he sometimes felt hampered,
knowing that fires on board ships are so critical and that
information wasn't easy to come by in the first hours of the crisis.
   Newsham, an electrical technician from Bay City, Mich., said he
was sometimes taken aback by the reaction to his news on the other
end of the line.
   ``You'd say, `No ma'am, that name's not on our list,' and you'd
hear a yell like the home team just scored a touchdown,'' he said.
   Even though Newsham said he tried to answer each and every
question, he knew he had to be brief because there were so many
callers waiting.
   ``Several said they were frustrated with trying to get through
... but as a sailor, it's reassuring to know that America does
care,'' he said. Over an eight-hour period, Newsham said, he
answered 450 to 500 calls.
   Another phone bank is set up so Navy officials can get in touch
with the families of those who have been identified as casualties,
and help make arrangements if two family members choose to travel
to them.
   If a family member calls in who has not yet been notified by the
Navy that a relative has been identified as wounded or deceased,
their telephone number and location is taken and the case is handed
to the officials in the Navy Casualty Assistance Division, Adm.
Gallo said.
   Death notification is only handled by officers from the division
in person, he said.
   That office is headed by Joe Greer, a civilian who has worked in
helping families deal with such crisis for 18 years.
   ``We go to great lengths to get in touch with the families. We
even enlist the state police, anyone who might help us,'' Greer
said.
   Gallo said the phone lines ``very quickly got swamped'' and many
families had to try repeatedly to get information.
   ``We learned something here,'' the admiral said, saying he will
be meeting with the telephone company next week to see if the
process can be made more flexible so that they can add additional
lines in such times of crisis.

   The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought
reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
   Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake
in Armenia killed about 25,000 people. Most died in structures that
collapsed when the quake hit.
   ``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' said Russ
Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
   The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but
Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7
according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
   In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the
fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after
midnight. Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a
ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
   In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later
blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
   ``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something
falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from
Golden, Colo.
   The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are
built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an
earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.
   The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that
area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said.
   ``Iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and that
there have been many smaller quakes.
   Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in
Iran during the last 30 years, Needham said.
   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable
of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

   But news anchors showed little emotion at the film clips of
death and destruction. The quake killed an estimated 25,000 people
in northern Iran.
   Iranian media, monitored from Nicosia, were quick to report
Thursday's earthquake. Within a half-hour, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported the tremor had been felt in Tehran,
the capital.
   But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the
damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions
that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces.
   The only color reported for hours was that when the quake hit,
Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer
match between Brazil and Scotland.
   Devastating quakes are not new to the country. About 25,000
people died in eastern Iran in a 1978 earthquake. Roughly the same
number died in a December 1988 quake in nearby Soviet Armenia.
   Iran has endured other large-scale tragedies in recent years. An
estimated 1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the
eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988. And the Islamic
revolution that in 1979 toppled the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
   Official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck.
During the Iran-Iraq war, it would come back on the air after
signoff to report important news, but there was no such move
Thursday.
   Iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main newscast
6{ hours later.
   The radio, like IRNA, also kept listeners informed about the
areas hit and the number of casualties. But again, the reporting
lacked color and description for hours.
   The television's first shots from the stricken north were
screened 12 hours after the quake with no comment from reporters.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared three days of
mourning for the quake's victims.
   During the 40-day mourning period declared after the death of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last year, only recitations from the
Koran, Islam's holy book, and documentaries on the revolution were
allowed on televison.
   But on Thursday, cartoons and an educational program for
children were aired, and the television ended its programming with
live transmission of a World Cup soccer match between Egypt and
England.

<HEAD>Dispute Within Administration Holding Up Nutrition Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A states' rights dispute among administration
officials could hold up a proposal to require nutrition labeling on
nearly all packaged foods, government sources say.
   White House officials oppose the Health and Human Services
Department's efforts to set up a uniform, national food-labeling
system that would supersede state rules, said the sources, speaking
Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   The food industry has been lobbying strongly for the
administration to propose national labeling regulations that could
not be disturbed by the states, although California is the only one
that currently might be affected.
   ``We have a national food system,'' said Roger Coleman, a
spokesman for the National Food Processors Association. ``We need
to have a free flow of these goods throughout the country, and to
avoid consumer confusion we need to have a national, uniform system
of food labeling.''
   Legislation pending in the House and the Senate would pre-empt
any state nutrition-labeling requirements.
   In announcing last March that the Food and Drug Administration
would propose food-labeling changes, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan
said states would be able to add to the federal requirements.
   But Sullivan recently sent to the Office of Management and
Budget proposed regulations for uniform national rules, government
and industry sources familiar with the regulations said.
   The department had hoped to announce the regulations and publish
them in the Federal Register next week.
   However, OMB officials argue the philosophical principles of
federalism in opposing pre-emption of state rules, the sources said.
   ``There is opposition from a number of agencies,'' one source
said.
   OMB spokeswoman Dede Spitznagel said officials at the agency
could not comment on the HHS proposal because it was still under
review.
   It was not clear whether the disagreement over pre-emption would
hold up the regulations. One source said, ``I think it will resolve
in the near future.''
   Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America, said the food industry supports labeling regulations as
long as they are applied uniformly across the country, as are
labeling rules for meat and poultry.
   Food industry officials have argued that if states are allowed
to add their own labeling requirements on top of federal labeling
rules, food companies could face as many as 50 different sets of
requirements.
   ``There is neither a medical nor a health reason why consumers
in one state need different health information about products than
people living anywhere else in the country,'' Nedelman said.
   Without uniformity nationwide, consumers would be confused and
manufacturers might decide not to market their products in states
where requirements varied from the majority, he said.
   California could be affected most directly by a federal
pre-emption, because that state's Proposition 65 allows officials
to require consumer warnings on products they deem to pose a risk
of birth defects or cancer. The cancer-warning is being challenged
in court.
   However, some observers say the California initiative would not
be affected because the regulations being drafted apply only to
nutrition content.
   Other pending regulations, though, would cover health messages
or claims, and some believe that if federal nutrition labeling is
deemed pre-emptive, that will be extended to health messages as
well.

<HEAD>`Watch List' of Foreigners Barred from U.S. Turns Out to Be Long</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's list of foreigners barred from
the country for political reasons is far longer than previously
thought, and most names were added since the Reagan administration,
documents show.
   Details of the so-called ``lookout book'' emerged in documents
released in response to a lawsuit brought by a prize-winning
Colombian journalist who was turned back at a New York airport four
years ago.
   The list, previously estimated by immigration lawyers to have
some 40,000 names, has 353,324 entries from 146 countries,
territories and other areas. More than two-thirds of the entries
appear to come after 1980.
   Officials cautioned there was no way of knowing how many
individuals were on the list, because some of the names are entered
more than once.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Chad Vignola, who handled the
government's case, said that an estimate by a lawyer for the
journalist, Patricia Lara, of more than 300,000 individuals is
``simply wrong.''
   Nevertheless, ``It's the first time that concrete dimension has
been given to the magnitude and scope of this lookout system,''
Lara's lawyer, Arthur C. Helton, said Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge John M. Walker, ruling last September in
Lara's case, ordered the list turned over to her lawyers. He said
the names of people on the list should remain secret to protect
them.
   The list, called the National Automated Immigration Lookout
System, was turned over to Helton earlier this month after more
legal wrangling.
   In the past, the list usually came to light only when the
government excluded famous people, including many whose writings
and movies were widely available here at the time the artists
themselves were barred.
   They included Nobel laureates Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Pablo
Neruda, authors Graham Greene, Doris Lessing and Carlos Fuentes,
French actor Yves Montand and former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian
Smith.
   The entries on the list date to 1904 but the vast bulk of
entries come under three sections of the 1952 McCarren-Walter Act.
The sections roughly cover security risks, political beliefs, and
subversion and violent activities.
   Most of the individuals _ at least 341,000 entries _ were barred
because of their political beliefs, according to Helton, an
attorney at the New York-based Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights.
   ``I think the disclosure is astounding both in terms of the
magnitude of the listings and the high level of current denial,''
Helton said.
   He said that more than two-thirds of the book's entries _
238,140 _ were made since 1980, and 4,399 in the first three months
of 1990.
   The increased number of exclusions came at a time when both
Congress and the courts were trying to narrow the scope of who
could be excluded, Helton said.
   That goal was achieved in February, when President Bush signed a
law prohibiting the exclusion of visitors on the basis of political
belief in the case of anarchists, Communists, or adherents to
totalitarian beliefs.
   Many immigration lawyers claim that the State Department is
ignoring the spirit of the law and continuing to exclude aliens for
political reasons.
   The government is not obliged to justify its exclusion
decisions. In the most recent entry on the ``watch list,'' for
example, dated March 1, the State Department excluded 46 people
under the political provision.
   A State Department spokesman, Philip Covington, acknowledged
that exclusion decisions have been subjective.
   ``Obviously, the law is interpreted in different ways at
different times,'' he said.
   The highest number of exluded visitors were from China, with
106,777 entries. The Soviet Union was in the middle range, with
33,064.
   Ms. Lara, a 1980 graduate of the Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism, came to New York in 1986 to receive the Maria
Moors Cabot Prize, awarded for advancing inter-American
understanding and freedom of information. She was detained at
Kennedy International Airport, her visa was revoked and she was
sent back to Colombia without a hearing.
   Authorities alleged she was linked to a Colombian terrorist
group. Ms. Lara maintained she was barred for writing articles
critical of U.S. policy in Central America.

<HEAD>Administration Dropping Plan for Limited Clinics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is abandoning plans for
limited-service methadone clinics that provide the drug but little
else to heroin addicts waiting for an opening in a comprehensive
treatment program.
   Officials at the Health and Human Services Department decided to
withdraw the ``no-frills'' proposal because of hefty criticism,
Mona Brown, a spokeswoman for the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
said Thursday.
   ``The comments and testimony (at public hearings) didn't support
going ahead,'' she said. ``We are rescinding those regulations.''
   Interim methadone maintenance clinics were proposed by the
institute and the Food and Drug Administration to help curb the
spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users, who can transmit the
virus when they share needles.
   In some cities, drug addicts have to wait for six months or more
to get into a comprehensive methadone treatment program that
provides support and counseling.
   Without the regulations, however, drug abuse treatment centers
can still apply for a waiver to allow them to set up an interim
clinic and dispense methadone on an outpatient basis, Brown said.
   Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City is the only
health-care facility currently operating an interim clinic under a
waiver.
   The proposed regulations would have eliminated the waiver
process and made it easier for treatment centers to operate interim
programs. In these programs, heroin addicts unable to get into a
comprehensive program can get methadone daily at outpatient clinics
and from mobile medical units.
   But critics disputed the effectiveness of methadone treatment to
wean addicts from heroin, and some feared that because of tight
budgets the limited-service programs would gradually replace
comprehensive programs.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control who opposed the proposed
regulations, praised the move by the Health and Human Services
Department.
   ``What addicts need and seek is comprehensive treatment allowing
integration into a fully productive life with education, job skills
and emotional support to stay drug free,'' Rangel said in a
statement.
   ``Just sending addicts back into the street with a different
drug is no answer,'' he said. ``Now I hope we begin developing a
strong comprehensive national treatment strategy.''
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan told Rangel's
panel last August that methadone programs were ``not ideal ... but
this we feel is better than nothing for those individuals.''
   However, studies by the congressional General Accounting Office
and the Drug Enforcement Administration questioned the wisdom of
the department's plan. They cited continued drug abuse by many
patients in methadone treatment and illegal diversion of the drug.

<TEXT>
   Texas developer Leonard Briscoe refused to
answer questions before congressional investigators looking into
the housing scandals, citing his constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   Briscoe, of Fort Worth, on Thursday became the sixth witness to
invoke his Fifth Amendment right in spurning questions from the
House Government Operations subcommittee on housing.
   He is the first such witness, however, who was not a former
official of the scandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban
Development. Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., now the
object of a special prosecutor's investigation, was among those who
would not answer questions.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said he intended to
provide special prosecutor Arlin Adams a letter requesting that his
inquiry be expanded ``and setting forth in detail evidentiary
support.''
   Briscoe contended that his attorney had not been given enough
time to prepare for the testimony and had been refused a delay in
his appearance under subpoena.
   But Lantos said Briscoe had initially agreed to testify
voluntarily and waited too long to obtain a new lawyer after his
first one withdrew because of a conflict of interest.
   He posed five questions to Briscoe, mostly about his
relationship with Lance Wilson, a former top HUD official who later
became a housing consultant and was involved in several projects
receiving lucrative HUD grants.
   Briscoe declined to answer each question. His attorney, Irvin B.
Nathan, angrily denounced Lantos outside the hearing room.
   ``The chairman's conduct today clearly indicates it was not a
fair hearing,'' Nathan said.
   DuBois Gilliam, a former deputy assistant secretary of HUD now
serving a prison sentence, testified under immunity last month and
named Briscoe in describing how lucrative federal housing and
community development grants were steered to favored developers.
   Wilson was involved in four low-income housing projects in
Florida and Texas in which he provided assistance or was paid
consulting fees or given a percentage interest. One of the
questions Briscoe refused to answer was why he gave Wilson a 15
percent interest in one project in Riviera Beach, Fla.
   Outside the hearing room, Briscoe denied making any improper
payments or gifts to Wilson or Gilliam.
   Wilson is a former executive assistant to Pierce and has also
invoked his constitutional right to avoid testifying.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves 1990 Farm Bill With Support From Key
Republicans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 farm bill goes to the Senate without
the boost in financial guarantees many Democrats wanted to give
farmers, but with a promise of support from key Republicans.
   ``There's not everything in here that every member would want
and I appreciate that,'' Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Thursday after the panel approved the
bill. But he said the measure ``makes sense for farmers and
consumers and is within the budget.''
   Leahy had worked particularly hard to strengthen environmental
provisions, including research to help farmers reduce chemical
additives, and revise agricultural trade policies to better assist
poor countries and governments moving toward democracy.
   A section that would protect private forest land also was added
to the measure that sets farm policy for five years.
   The estimated cost of the price supports over the life of the
bill is $55 billion.
   Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the committee's ranking
Republican, said both he and Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas
would support the measure on the floor.
   The House Agriculture Committee finished work on its version of
the bill last week with floor action expected early in July.
   The committee approved the bill on a 15-4 vote, with Sens.
Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., Max Baucus, D-Mont., Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
and Slade Gorton, R-Wash. opposing it.
   Lugar had said he would cause trouble for the legislation in the
Senate if the Democrats raised subsidies and moved the bill out of
committee on a party line vote. The Democrats have a 10-9 majority
on the panel.
   ``In order to get something to the floor, we had to make some
compromises,'' said Sen. Thomas Harkin, D-Iowa, who said he would
fight to increase target prices and loan rates once the Senate
debate begins. ``Senator Lugar and the Republicans dug in their
heels.''
   Heflin said target prices won't keep up with inflation under the
legislation and should have been higher. Baucus and Daschle also
wanted higher supports.
   Gorton said he voted against the bill because of its soybean
program and the committee's ``refusal to reform secondary programs
like honey, wool and mohair.''
   The plan on loan rates accepted by the committee gives the
agriculture secretary two options.
   The loan rate is the amount of money the government pays the
farmer in advance to cover production, using the expected crops as
collateral. If the market price is lower than the loan rate, the
farmer can forfeit his crops to the government instead of paying
back the loan.
   The secretary's first option would be to make loans under
existing formulas, though never dipping below the 1990 level. He
would not be able to activate the so-called Findley provision _ a
method used to reduce loan rates to bring U.S. prices for
commodities in line with the world market.
   The secretary's second option allows him to use the Findley
provision, but requires that he pay the farmer in advance three
quarters of a cent for every penny he reduces the loan rate. This
would be in addition to any other advance payments and would have
to be repaid by the farmer nine months after the start of the
marketing year.
   If the secretary selects the second option he would have to give
the House and Senate agriculture committees an explanation why,
based on budget implications, farm income, orderly marketing, price
competitiveness and avoidance of excess stocks.
   Acceptance of this loan rate provision was viewed as a
concession by the Republicans, but barely better than nothing by
the Democrats.
   Some other provisions of the bill:
   _Milk price supports at a minimum of $10.10 per hundred pounds,
the current rate.
   _A soybean marketing loan rate of $5.50 per bushel.
   _If malting barley prices exceed feed barley prices by more than
22 cents, the excess above 22 cents would not be considered in
establishing the barley deficiency payment.
   _For every 10 percent decrease in final deficiency payments that
result from an increase in prices, the agriculture secretary would
give 2 percentage points of the decrease back to the farmer.

   Maybe it was the coming of summer. Whatever
the reason, 150 to 200 Holstein cows broke loose from a farm and
strolled into this suburban community south of Seattle.
   The cows fanned out after escaping from Joe Neff's Auburn farm
just before midnight Wednesday. But most headed south along the
Valley Freeway.
   ``I couldn't believe it. They busted out of the barn and broke
through a half-inch-thick steel gate,'' Neff said.
   The cows didn't make it to downtown Kent or Auburn but their
proximity was sensed.
   ``When I came to work at midnight, it smelled like the Chicago
stockyards,'' said Auburn Jail officer Jim Miller.
   It took police in cars and on foot several hours to round up the
strays. The last of them were returned to the barn by 6:30 a.m.
Thursday.
   ``The police are very good cowboys,'' Neff said.

   A short elderly man's propensity for

threatening to impose fines if he doesn't change his ways.
   Even Abraham Cohen's lawyer was unable to explain the behavior
of his five-foot client.
   ``He's addicted to chatting up tall girls _ you'd think he would
be burnt out at 66,'' attorney Ron Cannon told Magistrate Malcolm
Whitely this week.
   Cohen pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault for feeling
the thigh of a woman sitting next to him on a shopping mall bench.
   In placing Cohen on bond, Whitley told him: ``If this happens
again, it's going to cost you 3,000 dollars ($2,400 U.S.). Explain
that to your wife.''
   Cannon said Cohen was one of his ``most persistent clients''
with a long record of similar offenses dating back 20 years, and
that he always paid his legal fees in advance to keep his wife from
finding out.

   The State Department, in a follow-up to
President Bush's suspension of the U.S. dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Thursday urged Americans traveling to the
Middle East and elsewhere to exercise ``extra caution.''
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher attributed the advisory to
rising tensions in the area but said he was unaware of any specific
threats.
   He said it was possible that the tension might increase as a
result of Bush's announcement but he stressed there were other
reasons for the warning as well.
   He recalled that on May 31, the day after the abortive attack by
the Palestine Liberation Front on beaches near Tel Aviv, the
department had said it was concerned about tensions in the region
and that terrorists had threatened to attack American citizens or
interests.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Increase in Airline Liability Payments</HEAD>

   Airlines would have to increase liability
payments to passengers who die in crashes under treaty protocols
approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The protocols to the Warsaw Convention, created in 1929, would
raise to $130,000 the per-passenger limit on liability regardless
of circumstances of the crash.
   The current limit is $75,000 per passenger, except in cases when
an airline is found guilty of willful misconduct.
   The vote on Thursday was 11-2, with Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
and Paul Simon, D-Ill., opposing the protocols. The protocols have
been fought by lobbying groups representing trial lawyers. Biden is
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Despite passage of the protocols, a stiff fight is expected on
the Senate floor where the measures have failed twice before.

<HEAD>Senator Suggests Bargain Troop Cuts for Concessions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military force reductions in South Korea
should be used to bargain for concessions from communist North
Korea, a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee says.
   Because some reduction of the 43,000-strong U.S. military force
in South Korea is inevitable, ``we should make a virtue of
necessity by using troop cuts as leverage for peace _ especially in
light of the need to engage North Korea in dialogue,'' Sen. Timothy
E. Wirth, D-Colo., said in a speech.
   ``In short, we should link coming troop reductions to a
redoubled effort at reconciliation on the Korean peninsula,'' Wirth
told a Wednesday meeting of Korean experts hosted by the Cato
Foundation, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.
   Noting that North Korean propaganda since 1953 has been aimed at
the U.S. military presence, Wirth suggested Pyongyang might respond
to such an approach.
   North Korea ``cannot remain unaffected by world changes,
especially in light of the changes under way in its superpower
allies,'' he said. ``The issue is how Pyongyang will manage the
inevitable transition from a closed society to a more open one,
from the 40-year rule of Kim Il-sung to a new generation.''

   Demonstrations at the world's largest
meeting on AIDS have taken on a predictable pattern _ a
theme-of-the-day march, speakers and street theater followed by a
sit-in.
   Each morning, a dispatch is sent out by ACT UP, the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, detailing the day's planned
demonstration. It ends each time with the same phrase: ``Civil
disobedience is anticipated during the protest.''
   The group's activities produced about 50 arrests Thursday,
bringing the total to 149 since the start of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS.
   On Thursday, the sit-in was at the busy intersection of Market
and Van Ness, where 50 protesters ignored police warnings and
huddled in the street. Several hundred other demonstrators remained
on the sidewalk yelling the group's slogan: ``Act up. Fight back.
Fight AIDS.''
   Before the sit-in, protesters lighted a small bonfire of protest
placards, spray painted Day-Glo slogans and outlined their bodies
with chalk to symbolize how the city's largely volunteer effort to
fight AIDS has been exhausted.
   Despite some claims of police brutality, there has been little
violence other than some shoving and a few bruised and bloodied
knuckles from police batons.
   While anticipated disruptions of science sessions at the Moscone
Center have failed to materialize, the protest organizers are
pleased with their showing so far.
   ``I think we've been very effective about getting on the agenda
and getting our voices heard,'' said Josh Gamson, a member of the
San Francisco chapter of ACT UP. ``It was very ambitious to get a
different theme out there each day.''
   The theme for Wednesday was access for those with AIDS to
research and policy making.
   On Thursday, demonstrators marched a winding route through San
Francisco's civic center area to point out what they claim is a
lack of government action and funding for AIDS programs.
   The march had stops at federal, state and city office buildings.
A mock trial was held outside the offices of state Insurance

<HEAD>Cheney Seeks Approval To Stop Some Construction Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is asking
Congress to cancel 68 of ``the most obvious'' construction
projects, mostly in Europe, and excluding strategic homeports in
the United States.
   The overwhelming majority of the projects are located in Europe,
with only three sites in the United States.
   They were chosen from a list of 207 projects worth $1.2 billion
Cheney has been considering canceling. Notably absent from the list
sent to Congress on Thursday were the Navy's ``strategic home
ports'' in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and New York.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said the remaining
projects still were under consideration for cancellation, including
the home ports, but that decisions on those would take more time.
   ``We know we are not going to need these facilities,'' Williams
said of Thursday's list. ``These are the cuts that are the most
obvious.''
   Cheney has come under intense criticism on Capitol Hill for
taking aim at military sites in Democrats' districts as he has
moved to pare funds from the Pentagon budget in this time of
lessened East-West tensions.
   The list contains a variety of construction projects, including
schools for military dependents in West Germany; munitions storage
centers in Italy; a mess hall on Guam; and even a ``classified''
three-unit housing project for families associated with the
super-secret National Security Agency.
   In the United States, the list includes $39 million for a supply
warehouse at Red River, Texas; $1.9 million for an addition to the
flight simulator at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona; and $56,000 for
fireplaces at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
   ``The secretary disapproves of installing fireplaces in senior
officer's quarters,'' the Pentagon announcement said. No other site
was singled out for mention.
   Formally, Cheney's action means that he is asking Congress to
``rescind'' the funds for the projects, which were authorized for
payment in past years.
   The move requires congressional approval and the funds will not
revert to the Pentagon coffers, Williams said.
   The spokesman said Cheney's decision to freeze nearly $7 billion
worth of military construction projects remains in effect, and that
additional requests to stop other projects could be made from that
entire group.
   While the Pentagon weighed the fate of the Navy homeports, two
senior Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee released a
congressional report showing that the Navy has not halted ongoing
construction at the Staten Island facility despite lawmakers'
letters calling for a stoppage.
   ``Work under contracts already awarded has continued unabated
and the Navy is going ahead with plans to dedicate the New York
Naval Station on June 25, 1990,'' the General Accounting Office
said.
   In addition, the GAO found that eight families of military
personnel assigned to the cruiser USS Normandy have moved to Staten
Island and 131 families are in the process of relocating from
Norfolk, Va., to New York.
   In a letter, Reps. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., and Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., urged Cheney to ``reverse engines on all family
relocations to Staten Island.''
   ``Families should not have to sell their homes, leave friends
and change schools just to have to turn around and return to their
old homes when the Staten Island homeport is finally and
permanently closed,'' Bennett and Schroeder said.

   The dollar ended the week at 154.75 yen, up 0.15 yen from

percent, down from the previous day's 7.155 percent.
   Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said there were no
major movements in yen-dollar trading in the absence of fresh news.
   ``Trading was rather centered on cross trading in which traders
sold the British pound on profit-taking and bought the yen,''
Tsuchiko said.
   The British currency has risen sharply in recent days on
speculation that Britain later this year would join the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which limits
exchange fluctuations.

   Nelson and Winnie Mandela made hope live again,
for a while, on a Harlem street corner brimming with history.
   The hope, and the pride, were evident on the faces of the
100,000 admirers as two black cultures, American and South African,
intertwined Thursday in a rally outside the Harlem State Office
Building.
   ``This is a day like none other in the history of Harlem,''
resident Isabel Coles said. ``It brings together the American black
and the African. This day symbolizes that we are one in spirit; we
are still African.''
   Some celebrated their African-American heritage by wearing red,
orange, yellow, gold or green dashikis, a type of African tribal
robe. Others simply wore Mandela T-shirts and buttons.
   Most reveled with the sound of African drumbeats, Jamaican
reggae and American jazz. Even a policeman danced when a Bob Marley
recording blared over the loudspeaker.
   Mandela, the 71-year-old African National Congress leader, told
the crowd that Harlem helped him win his freedom after spending 27
years in a South African prison for anti-apartheid activities.
   ``I am able to speak to you because of the massive resistance of
our people and the unceasing solidarity of millions throughout the
world. It is you, the working people of Harlem, that helped to make
it happen.''
   ``The kinship that the ANC feels for the people of Harlem goes
deeper than skin color,'' Mandela said. ``It is a kinship of our
shared historical experience and the kinship and the solidarity of
the victims of blind prejudice and hatred.''
   The rally was held on a corner _ 125th Street and Adam Clayton
Powell Boulevard _ that until a decade or so ago symbolized the
Harlem equivalent of London's Hyde Park. Pan-Africanists,
Garveyites and Malcolm X stood on crates or platforms to speak
before rallies or to passersby.
   This time, the stage _ and the audience _ was considerably
larger. But Mandela didn't forget the black heroes of yesteryear.
   The crowd cheered as Mandela evoked names like Martin Luther
King; Malcolm X; Marcus Garvey, the black nationalist leader of the
1920s; singer-actor Paul Robeson; and the late congressman for whom
the boulevard was named.
   The stage was shared by Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz. She
wept when Mrs. Mandela embraced her.
   ``Time is very short and I would like to stand right here and
cry for a thousand years but I cannot,'' said Ms. Shabazz. A woman
in the crowd shouted out, ``Me, too!''
   ``I greet you all in the Soweto of America,'' Mrs. Mandela said.
``It is a great honor for me, and especially the women of my
country, to stand here in the capital of the revolution throughout
the world: Harlem.''
   Mandela added: ``While my comrades and I were in prison, we
followed closely your own story of the injustices of racial
segregation and economic inequities.''
   ``To our people,'' he said, ``Harlem symbolizes strength and
beauty in resistance.''

   There's finally a full house at Yankee Stadium
this year.
   It took an appearance by Nelson Mandela to pack the place, where
crowds have been sparse this season for the Yankees _ the team with
the worst record in baseball.
   All 52,000 seats for a Thursday night concert featuring the
African National Congress leader were sold out, the mayor's office
announced. It was the first sellout of the season, including a
less-than-full house Opening Day.
   The last of the tickets were snatched up several hours before
the 7 p.m. show was scheduled to begin, said mayoral spokesman
Stanley Davis.
   Mayor David Dinkins' personal appeals on Wednesday for ticket
sales seemed to work, as 10,000 tickets went in the last 24 hours.
The most expensive seats sold for $500, while the cheapest were $5.

   Nelson Mandela's passionate plea for black
equality inspired legions of joyful supporters who packed the
streets of Harlem on Thursday in one of the most emotional and
exuberant stops on his world tour.
   For generations of American blacks, Harlem has served as
cultural capital, and Mandela's visit before a crowd that police
estimated at 100,000 was a tribute to his fight for racial justice.
   ``Brothers and sisters, comrades and friends, victory is in
sight,'' Mandela said. ``The light at the end of the tunnel is so
bright but we are not yet there.
   ``To reach the end of the tunnel it requires that we make the
necessary sacrifices. It requires that we remain unrelenting in
pursuit of our goal.''
   Recalling part of a speech he gave the day he was sentenced to
prison, Mandela told the crowd that abolishing apartheid ``is an
idea which I am prepared to live for but if need be it is an idea
for which I am prepared to die.''
   He added that while in prison he was ``aware of the resistance
of the people of Harlem and continue to be inspired by your
indomitable spirit.''
   ``My only regret is that I am unable to embrace each and every
one of you,'' he said.
   The crowd, which filled streets, balconies and fire escapes,
responded enthusiastically to Mandela and his wife, Winnie, with
shouts and raised fists.
   Mandela told the crowd he was moved by a slogan he had seen on a
woman's sweatshirt earlier in his visit. It said: ``Black by
nature. Proud by choice.''
   Mandela's visit to the United States has tapped into a deep vein
of emotion in black communities. In New York, a surge of pride has
welled up in neighborhoods where self-esteem is often lacking.
   He spoke in Harlem at 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell
Boulevard, a corner long associated with political oratory from
black leaders including W.E.B. duBois, Martin Luther King Jr., Paul
Robeson, Malcolm X, and the former congressman for whom the
boulevard was named.
   From Harlem, Mandela went to Yankee Stadium, in the impoverished
South Bronx, where he told a sellout crowd of 52,000 that he always
knew Americans were thinking of him when he was imprisoned.
   ``You, the people, never abandoned us even when we passed
through the most difficult years,'' he said. ``We are winning
because you made victory possible.''
   He said the ANC vision ``of a democratic South Africa is a
society free of all sort of racism and sexism.''
   His solemn appearance at the stadium ended on a lighter note
when Mayor David Dinkins presented Mandela a Yankees' warmup jacket
and baseball cap.
   ``Now you know who I am,'' a beaming Mandela said after donning
the cap. ``I am a Yankee.''
   Ticket prices at the stadium ranged from $5 to $500.
   The message to ``keep the pressure on'' until apartheid is
abolished has been a constant theme during Mandela's 13-nation ANC
fund-raising tour.
   Since his arrival on Wednesday, nearly 1 million people have
turned out to cheer and greet the African National Congress leader.
   The celebration began earlier Thursday at a joyous ecumenical
service at Riverside Church that brought religious leaders of all
faiths together in a call for equality.
   The invitation-only service was anything but solemn as
participants danced in the aisles to the beat of African drummers.
   Caught up in the fervor, the 71-year-old freedom fighter merrily
waved his fist and bopped to the crowd's rhythmic clapping after
the African National Congress choir finished singing its anthem.
   Addressing the congregation, Mandela invited longtime supporters
to ``come home to claim their rightful role in the recreation of a
new South Africa'' and thanked the religious community for its long
support.
   The ANC leader, released Feb. 11 from a South African prison
after serving 27 years for anti-apartheid activities, told the
crowd of about 2,000 that they were entering the final phase of
their struggle for black equality.
   But he also cautioned that ``the age of freedom has not yet
dawned'' and that to lift economic sanctions against the
white-minority South African government now would ``plunge us back
into the darkness from which our country is painfully struggling to
emerge.''
   Before the rallies, Mandela appeared on a local radio show, met
with the editorial board of The New York Times and taped a ``town
meeting'' with Ted Koppel, which was to be aired Thursday night on
ABC-TV.
   During the Koppel show, former Reagan administration official
Kenneth Adelman asked Mandela why he supported Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, Cuban President Fidel Castro and Libyan strongman
Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``One of the mistakes the Western world makes is to think that
their enemies should be our enemies,'' Mandela replied, to the
audience's loud approval. ``We have our own struggle.''
   He added that Arafat, Gadhafi and Castro ``support our struggle
to the hilt. There is no reason whatsoever we should have any
hesitation about their commitment to human rights in South Africa.
They are placing resources at our disposal to win the struggle.''
   Before the ecumenical service, Mandela met privately with 150
religious leaders and received a $200,000 check. Donations were
also made during the service but the amount raised was not
immediately available.
   Mandela began his day with an impromptu breakfast-hour stroll
through a park adjacent to Gracie Mansion, where he is staying with
the mayor.
   His unannounced appearance sent a dozen security men and scores
of police officers scurrying to surround him as he walked four
blocks to the park.
   ``It was very nice,'' he said afterward. ``Thank you. I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be so much trouble.''
   The security detail, dubbed ``Operation Topaz,'' is part of a
massive effort put together by city police and State Department
agents.
   Police overtime during Mandela's three-day stay is expected to
cost $2 million. Dinkins said the State Department has agreed to
pick up the tab.
   During his first day in New York, Mandela addressed Brooklyn
students, was given a ticker-tape parade up Broadway and received
the key to the city. Police estimated 800,000 people turned out to
greet him.
   On Friday, he is to address the United Nations General Assembly.
   Mandela is scheduled to fly to Boston on Saturday. Other stops
include Washington, where he will meet with President Bush,
Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif. He will
leave the United States on July 1.

<HEAD>Panel Says Preserving Breast in Early Cancer Doesn't Affect
Survival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of experts says removing a cancerous
tumor in the early stages of breast cancer gives as good a survival
chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast
is removed.
   Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and
lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give
``excellent'' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the
panel said.
   The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National
Institutes of Health to consider research on the survival of women
with early stages of breast cancer and to develop a consensus on
what therapy should be used to treat the disease.
   ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,'' said Dr.
William C. Wood, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and chairman of
the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.''
   Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early
stage breast cancer, Wood said. A lumpectomy is followed with
radiation therapy, and Wood said some patients choose mastectomy
because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of
radiation therapy.''
   In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is
saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy
for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is
preferable'' because the breast is preserved and the survival
chances are the same as for mastectomy.
   Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the
removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and
the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of
treatment have about a 90 percent chance of cure.
   About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast
cancer this year, the committee report said. Between 75 percent and
80 percent of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and
about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes.
   Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and
lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast cancer
long has been controversial.
   Traditionally, the preferred treatment has been a radical
mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is
removed. During the past two decades, there have been a number of
studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast
surgery, including lumpectomy.
   The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates
are virtually the same for the two types of therapy.
   The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up
treatment using chemotherapy or a drug that blocks the hormone
estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in
taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said
the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient's quality of life.
   For patients with very small primary tumors _ one centimeter or
less _ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said.
   The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be
based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full
understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are
not appropriate for all Stage I or II patients because of the size
of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps
within the breast, the committee said.

   Nelson Mandela's U.S. visit
splashed across most major South African newspapers, though
government broadcasts played down coverage of the black nationalist
leader.
   Mandela, on a world tour, received more subdued media coverage
on his European swing, with reports focusing more on the issue of
sanctions for South Africa's white government.
   The resurgent coverage since Mandela's arrival in New York on
Wednesday may be explained by South Africa's fascination with
American hype.
   ``The Big Apple threw its hat in the air yesterday and
demonstrated in its best and most extravagant way its admiration
and affection for Nelson Mandela in a parade was without precedent
in the city's history,'' correspondent Ramsey Milne wrote in
Thursday's edition of the The Star, the nation's largest daily.
   ``Mandela Wows New York'' was The Star's banner headline
Thursday. It carried a large front-page picture of Mandela in
almost every one of its nine editions Wednesday and Thursday.
   Most major newspapers in the country gave prominent play to the
cheers from American throngs and the praise from American officials
that greeted Mandela when he arrived in New York.
   However, an evening TV news program ignored the welcome, and two
other government broadcast outlets put on several other news items
first.
   Another exception was The Sowetan, the nation's largest black
daily newspaper. It continued the policy it has adopted since
Mandela left for his 14-nation six-week tour, by reporting his
progress on inside pages and devoting its front page to activities
of the black community inside South Africa.
   The pro-government English-language newspaper, The Citizen,
carried the banner headline, ``Mandela Gets Big U.S. Welcome'' on
Thursday. Its second story covered President Bush's remarks
Wednesday that he wanted to show appreciation to President F.W. de
Klerk for his movements toward ending apartheid.
   Mandela's historic ticker-tape parade through Manhattan occurred
too late to be broadcast on the evening television news show of the
government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. on Wednesday. It
was shown on the early morning news show Thursday but not repeated
Thursday evening, so most South Africans did not see it.
   Government-run Radio South Africa led its Thursday morning news
with a report that the U.S. State Department had suggested the
African National Congress could receive aid if it gave up violence.
The second item focused on Bush's remarks. The third news item
mentioned that Mandela had arrived in the United States, but gave
no details on his welcome.
   The same order was followed on the Thursday evening television
news broadcast in Afrikaans. But the Mandela items were carried
later in the TV show, which began with a Cabinet minister saying
the government wanted to begin negotiations on a new constitution
next year.

<HEAD>Some Skeptical About U.S. Supreme Court's Patronage Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some in this city once notorious for political
patronage were skeptical that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling outlawing
the system of jobs for political work will put such abuses to rest.
   But Michael Shakman, a Chicago lawyer whose lawsuits helped pare
patronage in the city, said the ruling Thursday could affect hiring
practices throughout the country.
   ``It should result in a much fairer system to applicants for
jobs who are no longer going to be required to give a political
loyalty oath, in effect, in order to get the job,'' Shakman said.
   Fred Cooper, a Georgia Republican Party official, predicted a
barrage of lawsuits alleging discrimination.
   ``Many departments do hire based on what they think the next
elections will bring,'' he said. ``This will be the basis for
complaints in the future.''
   Both political parties in Illinois have a long track record of
political hiring, but Chicago's system became particularly
well-known under Democratic Mayor Richard J. Daley, the
quintessential big-city boss in office for more than 20 years until
his death in 1976.
   Daley's son, Richard M. Daley, is now mayor of Chicago.
   Political consultant Don Rose, who worked against the elder
Daley, said the Supreme Court ruling is just another step away from
the late mayor's machine.
   ``It's just another reason for him to spin in his grave, but
he's probably used to it by now,'' said Rose, viewed by many as a
reformer.
   A 1973 federal court decree restricted political firings in
Chicago and other governments in northern Illinois. Eight years
after Daley's death, the administration of Harold Washington, the
city's first black mayor, agreed to a system intended to prohibit
most political hiring. That system remains intact. Thursday's
ruling came in an Illinois case and orders an end to political
hirings, firings and promotions. The court ruled that federal,
state and local government jobs generally may not be awarded based
on party affiliation.
   The justices, voting 5-4, said constitutionally protected rights
are violated when people are denied government jobs, promotions or
transfers for reasons of political partisanship. Partisanship now
may play a role in deciding who gets a government job only when
political affiliation is an appropriate requirement, such as for
high-level policy advisers.
   Two earlier high court rulings, in 1976 and 1980, basically
restricted political firings.
   ``I just think it's a futile attempt to try and change something
that's been here since the beginning of this city,'' said one of
Cook County's nearly 25,000 employees.
   Told that the high court had basically outlawed patronage, the
employee said, ``It'll still be the same thing, but it'll have a
different name to it.''
   The man, like other workers interviewed in the lobby of the Cook
County Building, refused to give his name.
   ``I think patronage will always be. ... Everybody has their own
people,'' said an administrator who has worked for the county for
14 years.
   The Supreme Court ruling stems from a 1985 federal lawsuit on
behalf of three Illinois residents who claimed they were denied
state jobs or promotions because they were not active Republicans.
   The suit was filed against Gov. James R. Thompson and other GOP
leaders in Illinois and contended the governor made party
allegiance a requirement for 68,000 state jobs under his control.
   Robert Chanin, a lawyer who represented the National Education
Association in urging the justices to stamp out patronage,
predicted little impact for federal jobs but wide impact on states.
   ``There are probably 40 states that have some type of
comprehensive merit system, but perhaps as many as 10 states and
Puerto Rico don't have such systems or have slippage in their merit
systems. They rely primarily on what amounts to a patronage
system.''
   Thompson, who is not running for re-election, again denied the
lawsuit's allegations Thursday. He said he has hired Democrats and
Republicans, but said he would choose a Republican if applicants
were equally qualified.
   ``I think the parties are worth saving and I think the Supreme
Court is naive in saying that patronage has no basis in
strengthening political parties,'' Thompson said.
   But Rose said, ``If the only reasons political parties can exist
and thrive is through abusive hiring and firing practices, than
there is no reason for them to survive.''

approaching, a constitutional agreement aimed at keeping
French-speaking Quebec in the Canadian federation was still blocked
in two provinces.
   The agreement must be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight
Saturday or expire. Eight of the provinces favor the Meech Lake
accord, as it is called.
   The five-point agreement would designate Quebec a ``distinct
society,'' something the Supreme Court would be obliged to consider
when looking at specific laws challenged under the constitution.
   Quebec is the country's largest province in terms of land area
and includes more than one-fourth of the country's 25 million
people.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, one of the most ardent supporters
of the agreement, flew Thursday to Newfoundland, one of the holdout
provinces, in an effort to save the agreement.
   In Manitoba province an Indian lawmaker demanding constitutional
recognition of Indian tribes as distinct societies has used
procedural delays to block debate for a week on approval of the
agreement.
   In a restrained but tough address on Thursday, Mulroney
confronted Newfoundland's 52-seat legislature with the possibility
of constitutional paralysis, economic problems and increased
support for the separatist cause.
   ``On that night, when you're sitting there with your family and
your children, one thought is going to go through your mind: do you
mean to tell me that we could have avoided all of this for Meech
Lake?'' Mulroney said.
   ``If that night were ever to come, the terms of Meech Lake are
going to look very, very reasonable indeed to every member of this
House of Assembly and every house of assembly across Canada,'' he
said.
   The Meech Lake agreement, first approved by the prime minister
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987, is aimed at winning
Quebec's signature on Canada's 1982 constitution. At that time, the
ministers set a three-year deadline for approval by the Parliament
and legislatures.
   In the interim, governments changed in three of the provinces _
Manitoba, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick _ and the premiers
reneged on the signatures of their predecessors.
   In early June, Mulroney called the premiers to Ottawa, where
they spent a week in intense private meetings. They agreed to pass
the original accord as it is. New Brunswick passed it last week.
   For many Quebecois in Montreal, Canada's second-largest city,
the arguments have worn thin and the endless debate over a document
thought signed and sealed in 1987 has led to widespread cynicism
and a rise in nationalist feelings.
   Premier Robert Bourassa has categorically rejected suggestions
for extending the Saturday deadline. ``There will be a profound
disappointment, sadness and much disillusionment in Quebec,'' he
said.
   A poll published Thursday in the French-language newspaper La
Presse indicated that 57 percent of Quebecois favor sovereignty, up
slightly from 56 percent in March.
   But, unlike a decade ago when a referendum was held by the
separatist Parti Quebecois to determine the future of the province,
passion is missing.
   ``I think people have accepted that it (Meech Lake) won't pass
with a shrug,'' said Robert Gagnon, a computer systems specialist
for a Montreal insurance company.
   Jean Chretien, leading candidate for the leadership of the
opposition Liberal Party, told the party's congress in Calgary that
failure of Meech Lake would not necessarily mean a breakup of
Canada.

   Men infected with AIDS are 14 times more
likely to pass on the deadly virus to women during sex than the
other way around, a new study indicates.
   Researchers looked at 58 male sex partners of infected women and
found that only one man became infected. In that case, the couple
reported having intercourse without condoms more than 1,000 times
over seven years.
   The research suggests that in the United States, at least, the
AIDS virus is transmitted far more efficiently from men to women
than from women to men.
   A similar study conducted in Europe found considerably less
difference between the sexes. The risk of male-to-female
transmission was only twice as high as female-to-male.
   Dr. Nancy S. Padian, who directed the U.S. study, said it was
unclear whether the difference could be attributed to biological
differences between the sexes or whether other factors are involved.
   Heterosexual transmission of AIDS is still relatively rare in
the United States. It accounts for 5 percent of the 130,000 cases
reported so far.
   In Africa, heterosexual AIDS is far more common. The virus seems
to spread with equal proficiency from men to women and from women
to men. Some experts believe that is because untreated venereal
disease is relatively common in Africa and resulting sores provide
openings for the virus to enter the body.
   Despite her findings, Padian said men should not become
complacent about the risk of catching acquired immune deficiency
syndrome from women.
   ``We still recommend caution with unknown sexual partners,
regardless of their gender,'' she said.
   Padian's research, conducted at the University of California in
Berkeley, was reported Thursday at the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS.
   Her group also studied 269 women who had sex with infected men.
Of them, 54 women, or 20 percent, caught the virus.
   When the figures were adjusted for the number of sexual
contacts, the researchers calculated that the male-to-female
transmission was 14 times more common than female-to-male.
   In the United States, AIDS is transmitted largely by male
homosexual intercourse and by sharing hypodermic needles. However,
women who have sex with male drug addicts are also at risk, as are
their babies, who can catch the virus before birth.
   In another report, doctors from Johns Hopkins University
recommended that all pregnant women be offered the option of AIDS
tests.
   Current health guidelines generally recommend that the tests be
suggested only for women who admit risky behavior, such as drug
abuse. However, the Johns Hopkins study showed that limiting
testing to these women will miss many who are infected and risk
passing the virus to their babies.
   At Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, health care workers
found that the number of women discovered to be infected more than
doubled when everyone was offered the test.

<HEAD>Ethiopia's President Calls Rebel Successes `Dangerous'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
told lawmakers rebel offensives must halted, warning that ``the
very survival of the nation is at stake.''
   The Marxist president spoke Thursday at the opening of the
annual session of the Shengo, or parliament. In his speech,
Mengistu cited recent successes by the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front and the Tigre People's Liberation Front.
   ``An extremely dangerous and critical situation now hangs not
only over the northern regions of the country but also throughout
the country,'' Mengistu told the 652 deputies and 2,500 government
and party officials.
   Mengistu urged lawmakers to pass a resolution ``expressing the
immediate answer of the Ethiopian people'' to the Eritreans'
refusal to resume peace talks. A round of talks had been set for
this month.
   The Eritreans, fighting a 3-decade-old secessionist war, said
last week they planned to achieve their goals militarily. Eritrean
and government representatives held two rounds of preliminary peace
talks late last year.
   The Eritreans, in their largest offensive to date, in February
captured the Red Sea port of Massawa. That cut all but air access
to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province.
   The Tigrean rebels, a smaller group, control Tigre, Eritrea's
southern neighbor. Since August, they have claimed battlefield
victories in Tigre's neighbors, Gonder, Wollo and Shoa, coming to
within 62 miles of the capital, Addis Ababa.
   The Tigreans, who began fighting in 1974, seek Mengistu's ouster
and the establishment of a more hard-line Marxist government. They
often coordinate their offensives with the Eritreans.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly Against Yen; Tokyo Stock Exchange Dips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dipped moderately.
   The dollar closed at 154.75 yen, up 0.15 yen from Thursday's
close of 154.60 yen. After opening at 154.98 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 154.65 yen and 155.00 yen.
   ``It's been a quiet day,'' said Chizuko Satsukawa, a currency
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo. She said the dollar stayed in a
relatively narrow range because of a lack of fresh market-affecting
news.
   The dollar was sold against the British pound on profit-taking
after the U.S. currency gained ground, she said. The British
currency has been advancing on speculation that Britain will join
Europe's unified exchange system this year, dealers say.
   About $8.65 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from
Thursday's $10 billion.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues fell 392.70 points or 1.22 percent, closing the week at
31,694.57. The Nikkei index lost 0.49 points, or 0.0015 percent, on
Thursday.
   Volume traded on the first section totaled 350 million shares,
down from the previous day's 400 million shares.
   Akira Shimoda, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities, said many
investors refrained from participating because of rising short-term
interest rates. He cited 7.5 percent interest rates on three-month
certificates of deposit.
   Shimoda said institutional investors in particular took a
wait-and-see position in advance of major political events set for
next month, including monetary unification of the two German states
and a seven-nation summit meeting of major industrialized countries
scheduled in Houston.
   In bond dealings, benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds closed at 87.18 points, up from Thursday's close of 87.14.
Their yield stood at 7.145 percent, down from the previous day's
7.155 percent.

<HEAD>Marc Bohan, Formerly of Dior, Expected To Take Over Hartnell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marc Bohan, the former designer for Christian
Dior, is expected to take over as artistic director of the fashion
house of Norman Hartnell, dressmakers to two generations of British
royalty.
   If the Bohan appointment is sealed, as expected, he will become
the first major French designer to head an English fashion house.
   ``There is a fairly imminent announcement expected,'' Hartnell's
chairman Manny Silverman said Thursday. ``We really should be
resolving it. The lawyers in the final analysis have to sort things
out.''
   The appointment of 63-year-old Bohan would be a coup for
Silverman, who led a consortium that rescued Hartnell from the
brink of bankruptcy in 1987.
   For the past three years, Silverman has been looking for a
top-flight designer for Hartnell.
   Bohan, a star in the French fashion world, was abruptly
dismissed by Dior in 1989 after 28 years. In an in-house coup that
shook the industry, he was replaced by Italian designer Gianfranco
Ferre.
   During Bohan's years at Dior, the company expanded into luxury
ready-to-wear, clothes for men and children. It also sold licenses
for accessories and household goods ranging from scarves to sheets.
   When he left Dior, Bohan took with him a fiercely loyal
clientele, including Princess Caroline of Monaco.
   The house of Hartnell, founded in 1924 by the late Sir Norman
Hartnell, has a prestigious past, which Silverman has said he wants
to revive.
   A romantic designer who loved full skirts, embroidery and
sequins, Hartnell designed the wedding and coronation gowns of
Queen Elizabeth II and the floaty chiffons still worn by Queen
Mother Elizabeth. His customers included the wealthy, the titled
and stars of the stage.
   After his death in 1979, the fashion house's fortunes started to
decline and in 1987, a court-appointed administrator was appointed
to look for ways to refinance the company. That's when Silverman's
consortium stepped in.
   Silverman tried out a number of British designers in an attempt
to restore Hartnell's image before casting his eye to France.
   The only other French-born designers to have had any lasting
impact on British fashion are Roland Klein, who set up business in
London some 20 years ago, and Catherine Walker of the Chelsea
Design Co., a favorite of the Princess of Wales.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori has indicated
he will probably support a U.S.-funded anti-drug plan his
predecessor rejected.
   ``In principle, I consider the agreement useful and opportune
for the fight against narco-terrorism,'' Fujimori, who is to take
office July 28, said Thursday.
   Under the accord, Peru would receive $35 million in U.S.
military aid this year. That includes $20 million for a training
base near Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, which is the world's main
source of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   At least a thousand Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are believed
to operate in the valley, located on the eastern jungles of the
Andes, 250 miles northeast of Lima.
   The rebels provide protection for drug traffickers in exchange
for money and arms.
   The military agreement has been strongly criticized by Peruvian
politicians who fear it will lead to direct U.S. involvement in the
country's guerrilla war.
   The outgoing president, Alan Garcia, refused to sign the
military aid agreement, demanding that the United States also
provide other economic aid for the anti-drug effort.
   U.S. and Peruvian authorities already run an anti-drug air base
in the valley. The training camp will likely be built at a
pre-existing Peruvian military base in the jungle, U.S. Embassy
sources said. An earlier plan to build the base in the valley was
abandoned.
   U.S.-Peruvian military relations were restricted after leftist
Gen. Juan Velasco Alvarado led a coup in 1968. Velasco forged close
military ties with the Soviet Union and obtained large amounts of
Soviet arms and equipment.
   More than 18,500 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path begans its armed insurgency 10 years ago.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says
international talks on German unification are not lagging behind
the fast pace set by the two Germanys.
   Another round of negotiations is scheduled today between the two
Germanys and the four World War II Allies that divided them: the
Soviet Union, United States, Britain and France. They are the
so-called two-plus-four talks.
   Baker met Thursday with East German Foreign Minister Markus
Meckel to discuss the international aspects of unification just as
the East German Parliament voted overwhelmingly to merge the
nation's economy with West Germany's.
   West German lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament approved
the same accord Thursday and upper house was expected to pass it
today. The treaty will result in de facto unification of the
Germanys on July 2. A full political merger is expected in the
months ahead.
   Most of the major domestic issues of German unity are being
resolved at a lightning pace, while the superpowers remain at odds
over the strategic role of a single Germany.
   Baker, responding to a question while speaking to reporters
after the meeting with Meckel, denied that the international talks
were being outpaced by domestic developments.
   ``I think the (talks) are moving along quite expeditiously,'' he
said.
   ``It is important in the view of the United States and some
other countries that there not be a hiatus between the internal
unification, that is political and economic unification of the two
Germanys, and a resolution on the external aspects of unification
...,'' he said.
   Baker arrived in East Berlin on Thursday for separate talks with
Meckel and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Before meeting with Meckel, Baker was asked about Meckel's
proposal for a joint Warsaw Pact-NATO summit on German unification.
   ``It seems to me that that might do some violence to the concept
of German sovereignity,'' he said.
   ``The meeting, as I understand it, was to consider whether or
not Germany should be a member of a particular alliance. Of course,
under the Helsinki Final Act that's up to the sovereign states to
make those determinations,'' he said.
   Meckel said after the meeting that he was proposing that the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
hold a summit in the fall and ``sign a declaration that we are no
longer enemies against each other.''
   Meckel, whose foreign policy pronouncements have sometimes
differed from those of East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere, said his proposal was ``accepted as an idea'' by Baker
and that it would be discussed later.
   The United States insists that a united Germany be a member of
NATO, which the Soviet Union opposes. East Germany is now in the
Warsaw Pact and West Germany is in NATO.
   Meckel and Baker spoke briefly to reporters after their
90-minute meeting.
   He said he and Meckel discussed the issues that will be dealt
with by all six nations today, such as the status of a unified
Berlin _ which is still technically under Allied control.
   But he reiterated that Germany itself should alone decide which
superpower alliance to join. Both German states favor NATO
membership.

   Seventeen shrimp fishermen have been ordered
to pay fines up to $12,000 for failing to equip their nets with

   It was the first major decision on enforcement of the

   Hugh J. Dolan, an administrative law judge in the Department of
Commerce, ruled the fishermen must pay the fines despite protests
that the cagelike devices would cause them financial ruin.
   ``Those who conduct commercial fishing operations are obligated
to know what the law and regulations are and to abide by them,''
said Dolan, ruling from Washington.
   His ruling, signed Tuesday and released Thursday, upheld fines
proposed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Three of the fishermen were fined $500, but most were fined $7,500
or $8,000. The highest fine was $12,000.
   The shrimpers in the Gulf of Mexico could have settled out of
court by installing TEDs but decided not to, officials said. Most
of the 17 fishermen are Vietnamese immigrants.
   The devices allow sea turtles to escape from shrimp nets.
Fishermen complain TEDs let the shrimp escape also.
   Dolan said Tee John Mialjevich of New Orleans, head of Concerned
Shrimpers Inc. who represented the fishermen, misled the 17.
   ``He assertedly told the shrimpers they did not have to obey the
law and that no fines needed to be paid because the law was to be
changed ...,'' Dolan wrote.
   Mialjevich would not comment Thursday.
   Federal officials first ordered shrimpers to install TEDs in
June 1987, but protests and legal fights delayed their use until
the Commerce secretary put regulations in full force in September
1989.
   Joe Gibson, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said about 325
citations for trawling without the devices were issued in 1989 and
1990. Records for this year show 218 of 373 vessels boarded by the
Coast Guard had TEDs, he said.
   In Washington, Marydele Donnelly, director of sea turtle
programs at the Center for Marine Conservation, said, ``This will
go a long way to improving that situation.''
   In his decision, Dolan cited a new study on sea turtles by the
National Academy of Sciences that recommended TEDs to save turtles.
The study said shrimp nets kill more turtles than all other human
activity combined.
   ``I am not unsympathetic to the plight of these hard working
fishermen,'' Dolan said, but he added that ``all Gulf shrimp
fishermen must abide by the laws enacted to protect endangered sea
turtles.''

   There was a time when the carefree boys of
Castro Street loved life and each other with equal abandon. Then
AIDS came, and they had to change their ways or die.
   Many changed; they practiced safer sex, used condoms, entered
monogamous relationships. Many others died.
   Now researchers say some of those who changed are reverting to
the high-risk sexual practices that spread the fatal disease. They
warned at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS Thursday that
the so-called ``relapse'' behavior by some gay and bisexual men
could mean a second, even more devastating wave of infection and
death than the one that already has swept their community.
   ``People changed because they were scared to death,'' said
Maggie Reinfeld of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, which
has created the nation's first program for confronting the relapse
problem. ``Safer sex gets a lot tougher when you have to live with
it over your whole life.''
   Almost 20 percent of gay and bisexual men surveyed in San
Francisco had abandoned safer sex practices at least once,
according to studies by the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at
the University of California, San Francisco.
   Ten years into the epidemic, educators say they are facing a
community increasingly weary from maintaining burdensome changes in
their lifestyle, a community grieving for the carefree days forever
lost.
   ``It isn't enough to say `Don't' because no adult can live with
`Don't' for a whole lifetime. Especially when it comes to sex,''
Reinfeld said.
   The American Foundation for AIDS Research has awarded $145,000
to community-based AIDS groups to create a National Relapse
Prevention Network, advertising campaigns in San Francisco
addressing relapse and a series of seminars in Los Angeles based on
the GMHC's ``Keep It Up'' relapse workshops.
   The percentage of gay and bisexual men consistently practicing
safer sex has jumped from 31.6 in 1984 to 57.9 in 1988, researchers
say. But with an estimated 1 million HIV-infected people in the
United States today, about 67 percent of them gay and bisexual men,
relapse to high-risk behaviors can have potentially devastating
results.
   ``No HIV educator can expect to change the basic behaviors that
form our identity. We can modify those behaviors to the extent that
we can help people replace risky things with less-risky things,''
Reinfeld said.
   ``But when that involves sex, replacement does not mean
sanitizing behavior so it's acceptable to the rest of the world. It
does mean helping people create satisfying alternatives _
alternatives that are hot, sexy, raunchy and sometimes shocking to
the people outside the community.''
   Educators say that it's increasingly common for gay men to
engage in risky sex binges: practicing safe sex or celibacy for
months at a time, then spending one wild night of total abandon.
Men at special risk of relapse include those in their 20s, those in
monogamous relationships and substance abusers.
   ``It's common to hear, `I got so drunk' _ that whole story,''
said GMHC's Michael DeMayo, who created the ``Keep It Up'' relapse
program, which has helped 1,200 men in the last 10 months. ``(It's)
used time and time again as an excuse to engage in behaviors that
are remembered and longed for, mourning for a whole way of life.''

   Eunice Kiereini tells the story of three
young African children, born a year apart, orphaned by AIDS and
left to die in a small room by their relatives.
   Munkolenkole Kamenga speaks of the 3-year-old abandoned by his
father in Zaire after his mother died of AIDS at age 32. He was
taken in by his grandmother, already caring for six other children.
   Anne Bayley recalls the words of the taxi driver, one of 10
children, who has lost two brothers to AIDS. They had seven
children between them. The driver has tested positive for the
virus, as has another sibling. They have 16 children between them.
   In Africa, where 80 percent of AIDS is spread through
heterosexual contact and 50 percent of cases are in women of
child-bearing age, more than a million uninfected children under
the age of 10 have an HIV-infected mother, said medical specialists
at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS.
   That means that sometime in their lives, they probably will
become orphans, a condition once unknown in most parts of Africa
because of the tradition of extended families. AIDS has changed
that.
   ``Now, in some parts of Africa, other family members are already
overwhelmed by children whose mothers and fathers have died from
AIDS and cannot accept them,'' said Mrs. Kiereini, chairwoman of
the World Health Organization Regional Nursing-Midwifery Task Force.
   ``Others will not accept even these non-infected children
because of the false beliefs that these children will somehow cause
them bad luck or even infect them with HIV. Orphans have therefore
become a tragic African reality.''
   In African society, women are expected to bear large numbers of
children, as well as grow crops, collect water and cooking fuel and
take surplus crops to village markets to sell. When the mother
dies, the family often crumbles.
   In a study of 468 children of HIV-infected mothers over a
three-year period, Kamenga of Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Zaire,
reported Thursday that 15 of 28 children orphaned in that time were
not being cared for by their fathers. More than 60 percent of the
fathers either had died or abandoned their children after learning
that the child's mother died of AIDS.
   SIDA is the French acronym for AIDS. HIV is the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Bayley, who works with AIDS organizations in Uganda, said she
hears the same story day after day.
   ``The person sitting in front of me, whether man or woman, has a
spouse who is sick. Sometimes that spouse has died, six months ago,
or last week. Often I ask, `How old is your youngest child?' I
hear, 4 or 5. The next question is, `Have you lost a child?' And
too often, the answer is yes.
   ``The mothers of Africa are crying.''

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old boy who testified he did ``bad
things'' after repeated viewings of the movie ``A Clockwork
Orange'' was convicted of fatally stabbing and strangling a friend
in her back yard.
   A jury watched about 50 minutes of the 1971 film before it
convicted Michale Anderson on Thursday of murdering 17-year-old
Karen Hurwitz last fall.
   Anderson's attorney, Jon Botula, said Anderson was incited to
kill by numerous viewings of the movie, which stars Malcolm
McDowell as a marauding young Briton with a vacant stare who acts
on his violent impulses.
   Anderson told police he did ``bad things'' only while wearing a
black ``Clockwork Orange'' T-shirt. He wore the shirt when the girl
was stabbed six times in the sternum with a martial arts sword and
strangled at her Pittsburgh home.
   ``I think there's a great deal of emotion attached to this case
and a great deal of sympathy for the family,'' Botula said. ``I
think that entered into the verdict.''
   Karen's parents, Linda and Dennis Hurwitz, left the Allegheny
County courtroom shortly after Botula began showing the jury the
movie, which was directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the 1962
novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess.
   ``You can't stand to think that your child has been so
brutalized, and someone who is the most gentle _ I mean, she would
not kill a spider in the house,'' Ms. Hurwitz said after the
verdict was announced.
   In the movie, Alex, who is McDowell's character, and his gang
kill and rape at random on the streets of post-modern England. Alex
eventually is caught by authorities, who try to deprogram him.
   The film was nominated for several Academy Awards but was
denounced for extending the frontiers of screen violence. In 1972,
Kubrick withdrew the movie from British circulation because of
death threats.
   Anderson faces a mandatory life sentence without parole. Botula
said he will appeal.
   Ms. Hurwitz recalled seeing the movie while pregnant with Karen.
   ``I remember walking out afterwards so shaken, saying to myself,
`I hope I'm not bringing my child into a world with these kinds of
people, without any feeling or any emotion _ just plain brutality,'
'' she said.
   Anderson, who also was convicted of stealing the Hurwitz's car
after the killing, still faces charges of stealing Karen's credit
card and running up $600 in purchases, prosecutor W. Christopher
Conrad said.
   Common Pleas Judge Robert Dauer revoked Anderson's bond and
ordered him to appear Aug. 23 for sentencing.
   Anderson has been held at a juvenile detention center since his
arrest.

   Nelson Mandela says he supports PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, Libyan Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Cuban President
Fidel Castro because they have helped South Africa's blacks fight
for human rights.
   ``One of the mistakes that the outside world makes is to think
that their enemies should be our enemies,'' Mandela said Thursday
during the taping of a television special. ``Our attitude toward
any country is determined by the attitude of that country toward
our struggle.''
   On the second day of his U.S. trip, the leader of the African
National Congress faced questions at a ``Town Meeting'' attended by
1,000 invited guests on the City College of New York campus. Ted
Koppel, moderator of ABC's ``Nightline,'' was host for the hourlong
program, broadcast later Thursday.
   Also on Thursday, interviewed by New York Times editors and
writers, Mandela said the ANC wasn't committed to socialism as the
only way to redress the economic disparities between South Africa's
whites and blacks.
   ``We are not looking at any particular model,'' Mandela said.
``As far as economic policy is concerned, our sole concern is that
the inequalities which are to be found in the economy should be
redressed.''
   In his first speech after he was released in February, Mandela
called for a ``fundamental restructuring'' of his country's
economy. The ANC has long supported nationalization of important
industries.
   Mandela, however, told the Times: ``If anybody can indicate to
us that there are other options which will enable us to rectify
this imbalance, we will certainly look at that option and the
question of nationalization for us will not be an option at all.''
   At the ``Town Meeting'' taping, the hand-picked, overwhelmingly
pro-Mandela audience often erupted into cheers when Mandela
responded firmly, sometimes with biting sarcasm, to questions about
his political and economic views.
   Kenneth Adelman, former director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency under President Reagan, asked Mandela why he
embraced Arafat, Gadhafi and Castro, leaders the United States
accuses of supporting or encouraging international terrorism.
   ``Yasser Arafat, Colonel Gadhafi, Fidel Castro support our
struggle to the hilt,'' said Mandela. ``There is no reason
whatsoever why we should have any hesitation about their commitment
to human rights in South Africa. They are placing resources at our
disposal to win the struggle.''
   At another point, he described Arafat as ``a comrade in arms,
and we will treat him as such.''
   Koppel cautioned Mandela not to be ``misled by a hometown
crowd,'' and said his views would not be well received by other
Americans, especially Jews, and might imperil congressional support
for sustaining economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Mandela said his organization ``sympathizes with the struggle of
the Jewish people down the years'' and recalled that Jewish lawyers
were the first to defend him and his ANC colleagues arrested for
resisting the minority regime in South Africa.
   ``That does not mean that the enemies of Israel are our enemies.
Anyone who changes his principles, depending on who he is dealing
with, is not a man who can lead a nation,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela also warned that efforts by Western countries such as
the United States to help South African President F.W. de Klerk's
reform program will have the opposite effect, by driving white
South Africans toward the country's racist right wing.
   ``Please, whatever you do, don't do that,'' he said. ``You are
playing with fire if you think of rewarding Mr. de Klerk, because
you will undermine his position.''

   The dollar was higher in quiet and uneventful
trading in Europe this morning. Gold prices were weaker in thin and
directionless dealings.
   Dealers said uncertainty about developments in Germany were
providing support for the U.S. currency.
   ``The dollar is firm but not euphoric,'' said one Milan trader.
``People prefer to buy, but there isn't much to spark their
imagination.''
   The trader attributed the dollar's positive undertone to
perceptions that U.S. interest rates won't be likely to ease in the
short term, and continuing concern about the West German mark's
reaction to German Monetary Union.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.15 yen to a closing 154.75 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.87 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6800 West German marks, up from 1.6795
   _1.4155 Swiss francs, up from 1.4150
   _5.6400 French francs, up from 5.6385

   _1,238.50 Italian lire, up from 1,231.00
   _1.1770 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1748
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7203, compared
with $1.7255 late Thursday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $349.50 an
ounce this morning, down from $350.25 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $349.40, down from $350.50 late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 82 cents to close at $350.83.
   Silver opened in London at a bid price of $4.84, unchanged from
Thursday.

   The changing terminology of AIDS does more
than shape the way people talk about the disease, experts say, it
shapes everyone's way of thinking about and responding to the
epidemic.
   Activists at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS this
week are so sensitive to some words and phrases they distributed a
``Buzzword'' flyer. It spells out why speakers at the meeting,
which began Wednesday and continues today, run the risk of being
booed if they use politically incorrect words.
   Among the taboo phrases are ``high-risk groups,'' ``innocent
victims,'' and ``intimate sexual contact.''
   The evolving terminology of AIDS is based on the idea that
language is political, said Robin Lakoff, a linguistic professor at
the University of California at Berkeley.
   ``In the last 30 years, people have become more sensitive about
the language they use and about the language used about them,'' she
said.
   Disempowered groups will change the language about them to gain
respect and authority, she said. The civil rights movement
effectively changed ``Negro'' to ``black,'' and the women's
movement changed ``lady'' to ``woman'' for that reason.
   AIDS workers prefer ``high-risk behavior'' to ``high-risk
groups'' because actions such as sharing drug needles spread AIDS,
not mere membership in a group, such as intravenous drug users.
   Language change may start out as a psychological factor for
empowerment, Lakoff said, but ``it has very real consequences. The
way you think can change your behavior.''
   Calling an infant ``an innocent victim of AIDS'' is considered
very impolitic, AIDS workers say, because it implies other people
living with AIDS somehow deserve it and should feel guilty about
contracting the disease.
   AIDS workers also say people are not ``AIDS victims'' _ they are
``people with AIDS,'' or more recently, ``people living with
AIDS.'' To call people ``victims'' strips them of dignity, workers
say.
   Dr. David Wilkins, an associate professor of linguistics at the
University of California at Davis said he has found evidence of a
skewed terminology prompting ignorance about a subject.
   In word-association tests using ``AIDS'' as a prompt word,
Wilkins said his students responded with such words as ``death,
gay, fear, homosexual.''
   ``People learn the words,'' Wilkins said, ``but they use the
words to convey these associations, not what the words actually
mean.''
   AIDS educators are rankled by terms they find too vague, such as
``bodily fluids.'' Semen, vaginal fluids and blood are known to
transmit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but not tears,
sweat and saliva.
   Similarly ``intimate sexual contact'' makes some people think of
kissing and fondling. AIDS activists say the media should name
specific acts of sexual intercourse in discussions of high-risk
behavior.
   Using specific language instead of polite euphemisms, and using
non-judgmental language was crucial in this city's attempts to
treat the disease, said Rene Durazzo of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation.
   ``One of the reasons we have been able to be successful is that
we have been able to stress behavior without pointing fingers,''
Durazzo said. If the language seems to be judgmental, ``you start
to alienate the very people you want to reach.''
   Recently, Durazzo named one of the most important changes in the
AIDS language as being the shift to discussing HIV as a critical
problem, not just AIDS.
   Rather than calling HIV the ``AIDS virus,'' Durazzo prefers that
AIDS be portrayed as the most acute stage of infection with HIV.
   ``There was a misconception that people who were infected but
didn't show it were well,''' Durazzo said. With the increased focus
on HIV, Durazzo said, funding and awareness of early intervention
programs has increased significantly.

   Tropical storm Ofelia intensified
into a typhoon today as it roared off toward Taiwan after pounding
the northern Philippines with wind and rain. At least 11 people
were killed, officials said.
   The Manila weather bureau announced this evening that Ofelia had
developed typhoon status, churning up winds of 75 mph.
   Ofelia had been expected to cross the northern tip of Luzon, the
main Philippine island. But officials said the storm veered
northward, skimming the east coast of Luzon's Cagayan province
before heading toward Batanes, the northernmost Philippine
province, about 400 miles north of Manila.
   It was the second big storm to strike the country this eyear.
   Storm warnings were raised over 13 Luzon provinces, and small
craft were warned to remain in port. Residents of the affected
provinces were warned to be alert for landslides and flooding.
   In Manila, heavy rains drenched the city throughout the night
and waves crashed over the seawall along Manila Bay. Schools were
closed today, and widespread areas of the city were without
electricity.
   In Guam, about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines, the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center reported that another tropical storm had
developed and was heading west-southwest in the general direction
of the Philippine island of Mindanao.

<HEAD>Crews Transfer Oil From Wrecked Tanker; Slick Continue to
Dissipate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews aboard the fire-ravaged Mega Borg
are continuing to transfer millions of gallons of oil from the ship
onto other vessels and expect the process to be finished by next
week.
   The tedious transfer, known as ``lightering,'' began Wednesday
night. It had been delayed for a few days so salvage crews could
test the stability of the 886-foot Norwegian tanker, which was
rocked by an explosion June 8 while transferring oil to another
ship.
   The transfer is being done using portable pumps because the Mega
Borg's pump room was destroyed in the fire following the explosion,
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jerry Snyder said Thursday.
   ``The lightering is going well,'' he said. ``They boosted their
maximum output to 9,600 barrels per hour. It's continuing right on
schedule and we expect to fill the motor vessel Janus by Saturday
and then start transferring the cargo onto the motor vessel
Atlantis.''
   Unless there are complications, the entire transfer should be
completed by Monday, Snyder said.
   Crews already have removed 1.3 million barrels of oil off the
crippled Mega Borg, anchored 57 some miles from Galveston, he said
late Thursday.
   The tanker's remaining cargo, estimated at 34 million gallons,
will be taken to terminals in Texas City and Houston in two trips,
said Robert Klawetter, an attorney for the Mega Borg's owners. No
decision has been made on whether the super tanker will be scrapped
or salvaged, he said.
   Coast Guard officials said 3.9 million gallons of oil leaked
from the tanker. Most of it either burned, evaporated or has been
skimmed from the water.
   An oil slick, once 30 miles long, that resulted from the
explosion is continuing to dissipate into a series of patches
offshore. Coast Guard officials said they could not predict where
tar balls may wash ashore, raising the possibility that much of the
remaining oil spill may never reach the beach.
   ``It's out there and heading further out,'' Snyder said. ``It's
about 18 miles offshore and not well defined at all. It's breaking
up because of a 3- to 4-foot chop.''
   If the oil patches start to move, they probably would wash
ashore somewhere along a 47-mile stretch of beach between High
Island and Sabine Pass, the Coast Guard predicted. High Island is
about 30 miles northeast of Galveston, and Sabine Pass is farther
up the coast at the Louisiana border.
   There have been no reports of tar balls from the Mega Borg
reaching Texas beaches. Earlier this week, volunteers helped clean
beaches of debris in an effort to make any later cleanup of oil
easier.
   The cause of the Mega Borg blast has not been determined. Two
crew members died and two others are missing and presumed dead.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Detroit Has $359 Million in South African-Linked
Investments</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Mandela, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This black-majority city, now preparing a gala
welcome for Nelson Mandela, has $359 million in pension fund
holdings invested in companies linked to South Africa, a newspaper
reported today.
   A check of investments held on Jan. 1 by the police-fire and
general pension funds found they held stock in 113 U.S. companies
that do business in the white minority-ruled nation, the Detroit
Free Press said.
   The South Africa-related holdings totaled $359 million, 16
percent of the funds' combined holdings of $2.45 billion, the
newspaper said.
   Mandela, the South African black nationalist leader who began a
U.S. tour on Wednesday, has repeatedly urged a continued U.S.
economic boycott of South Africa in hopes it will force the
white-minority government to end racial inequality.
   Unlike the state of Michigan, Detroit lacks a policy of
divesting itself of investments in companies involved in South
Africa.
   Of the top 20 U.S. employers in South Africa identified by the
Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington, D.C.,
Detroit's pension funds own stock in 16.
   ``Holy Toledo! I just can't believe it,'' said City Councilman
Jack Kelley, one of 10 trustees on the board of the city's general
retirement system.
   ``If that's true ... I'm ashamed,'' said Hesther Wheeler, former
president of the Phoenix, a black firefighters group.
   Mandela is scheduled to speak Thursday night to 49,000 people at
a rally at Tiger Stadium, organized by Mayor Coleman Young, who has
contributed $10,000 to the event.
   Efforts to reach Young for comment were unsuccessful Thursday,
the Free Press said.
   City Finance Director Bella Marshall, one of 11 trustees for the
police and fire system pension fund, said she was unaware of the
South African-linked investments.
   ``The pension funds speak for themselves,'' she said.
   Detroit has kept its South African-linked stocks because the
trustees have decided that selling them would be financially
irresponsible, said Thomas Zdrodowski, executive secretary for the
pension funds.

<TEXT>
   More than a million residents of Tel Aviv and
its suburbs were urged today to boil drinking water after a high
concentration of fecal bacteria was found in water supplies.
   Drinking water contaminated with the bacteria, a coliform, can
cause gastrointestinal problems, which can be severe for infants
and the elderly.
   The affected region is home to about 22 percent of Israel's 4.5
million people.
   Dr. Vera Adler, head of the Health Ministry's public health
department, told Israel radio that the department initially asked
that more chlorine be added to the water.
   But, she said, ``we still got contaminated water, even with
increased chlorination.''
   The water for the coastal region is drawn from the Sea of
Galilee and piped to Tel Aviv via the national water carrier,
Mekorot. A Mekorot official said the water leaving the Galilee was
pure and that it was being contaminated within the Tel Aviv
region's water system.
   Health officials said this could be the result of algae in the
system.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos' racketeering trial will go to the
jury although the presiding judge has questions about why the
former Philippines first lady is being prosecuted in the United
States.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan on Thursday rejected motions
by the defense to dismiss all charges. Defense lawyers routinely
request dismissal after prosecutors rest their case, arguing they
failed to prove the charges.
   But Keenan repeated earlier puzzlement about why the case was
tried in the United States because much of the alleged illegal
activity took place in the Philippines.
   ``Although the court has expressed questions concerning the
prosecution, it is not under the American system of jurisprudence
to make policy decisions,'' Keenan said. ``That's for the executive
branch of our government.''
   Closing arguments will begin Monday, with the jury expected to
get the case by Thursday.
   The prosecution called 95 witnesses over three months. The
defense did not present a case.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. If convicted,
she would face a maximum of 50 years in prison and a $1 million
fine.
   The government alleges that Mrs. Marcos and her late husband,
former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, looted their
country's treasury of $222 million during their 20 years in power,
investing some of the money in four New York office buildings,
jewelry and art works.
   Co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi, a 54-year-old Saudi Arabian
financier, is accused of faking documents to help the Marcoses
conceal their ownership of the real estate and some paintings after
a U.S. court order froze their assets following their ouster from
power in February 1986.
   If convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice, he could
be sentenced to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 11 whites in
connection with a right-wing plot to assassinate Nelson Mandela,
President F.W. de Klerk and other figures, a newspaper reported
today.
   Authorities confirmed the arrests and said all were later
released.
   The Afrikaans-language weekly Vryeweekblad said that according
to the plan, Mandela would be shot by a sniper at Johannesburg's
Jan Smuts Airport when he returned July 18 from his six-week tour
of North America, Africa and Europe. The black nationalist leader
is in New York today.
   The report said the plot was exposed by Jannie Smith, a former
security policeman and National Intelligence Service agent, after
he infiltrated far-right groups including the Afrikaner Resistance
Movement.
   There was no immediate government comment on details of the
report. But a spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Order confirmed
that 11 men had been arrested, then released. The spokesman, Capt.
Peet Bothma, said they had been held under a law allowing police to
hold a suspect for 48 hours for questioning.
   He confirmed that security for government ministers has been
increased. South African police do not normally protect Mandela.
   The spokesman said that if police believe there is a specific
case to pursue they will present the information to the attorney
general, who may then decide whether to prosecute.
   The newspaper quoted Smith as saying the plot also called for
killing South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo, Minister of
Law and Order Adriaan Vlok, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha
and Minister of Defense Magnus Malan.
   Some prominent staff members of the government-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. television station were also on the hit list,
the report said.
   In London, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the
government's leniency toward right-wing groups created the climate
for racist assassination plots.
   ``We've always said the government was not coming down
sufficiently strongly on the right wing, and there have been very
many incidents in the past which just seem to baffle the police,''
Tutu said in an interview with Sky TV during a visit to Britain.
   De Klerk's government this year freed Mandela from 27 years in
prison, has begun dismantling apartheid laws and lifted repressive
state of emergency measures in most of the country.
   The Afrikaner Resistance Movement planned to blow up power
stations, eliminate members of Parliament and to poison the water
supply to Soweto, a huge black residential area outside
Johannesburg, the report said.
   The plot to kill Mandela, deputy president of the African
National Congress, was planned by former Nazi captain Heinrich
Beissner, the newspaper said. It said Beissner, 77, is now a
regional head of the right-wing Afrikaner Resistance Movement in
South Africa.
   The newspaper said Smith was told June 19 that he was to carry
out the Mandela assassination using a rifle with telescopic sights.
He was also asked to kill Slovo.
   A council member on the right-wing Boksburg Town Council, T.J.
Ferreira was among those arrested Thursday, the report said. They
were held in terms of Section 50 of the Criminal Procedures Act,
which allows the police to hold a suspect for 48 hours for
questioning, it said.

<HEAD>Personal Income Up Slightly in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal income edged up 0.3 percent in May
for the second straight month, but personal spending was unchanged
from the previous month, the government said today in another sign
of consumer caution.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
since it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity.
   The Commerce Department reported that incomes totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.70 trillion. The 0.3 percent
gains followed three consecutive monthly advances of 0.8 percent
and were the lowest since a 0.2 percent increase last September.
   Consumer spending remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $3.66 trillion after seven straight months of gains,
including 0.5 percent in April and 0.3 percent in March. But even
the April and March advances were weaker than first thought. They
were revised downward from 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent reported
last month.
   Today's report follows other signs of consumer weakness
including three consecutive monthly declines in retail sales
through May. It was the first time retail sales had dropped three
months in a row since the summer of 1981 during the last recession.
   Nevertheless, the difference helped improve Americans' savings
rate. The rate _ savings as a percent of disposable income _ rose
to 6.2 percent following a 6.0 percent rate in April and a 6.3
percent rate in March. The March rate was the highest in five years.
   A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital
since funds thus would be available domestically for business
investment.
   The report said American's income after taxes increased 0.2
percent, the same rate as in April.
   The key component of the income category _ wages and salaries _
rose $10.3 billion after a $16.4 billion gain the previous month.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods _ products
expected to last at lest three years _ fell $12.6 billion after a
$8.5 billion gain in April. But durable goods purchases had fallen
the previous two months.
   Purchases of non-durable goods were down $500 million in May,
their third consecutive decline. Spending on services slowed to
$13.1 billion after a $14.7 billion gain in April and a $19.6
billion advance a month earlier.

   A newly hired bodyguard for ``scream comic''
Sam Kinison has been arrested for investigation of rape after
Kinison's girlfriend was assaulted, then shot at her attacker in
the entertainer's home, officials said.
   Kinison slept through the incident Wednesday night at his
Hollywood Hills house, police said Thursday.
   Kinison's girlfriend was treated for the sexual assault but was
otherwise unharmed, police Capt. Rick Dinse said.
   Jeff Albright, a spokesman for Kinison, said the comic had no
comment.
   ``Sam is badly shaken up by this whole incident and is
unavailable to talk about it,'' Albright said.
   Shattered windows in the two-story home marked the path of four
bullets from a .44-caliber Magnum pistol. No one was hit by the
shots. The woman, who is in her 20s, fired at her assailant after
the attack, police said.
   Unway Carter, 22, described by police Detective Gil Jones as
Kinison's 6-foot, 4-inch, 300-pound bodyguard, was arrested early
Thursday.
   Carter remained in jail early today in lieu of $10,000 bond.
   The woman was attacked in a bedroom as Kinison slept in another
room, Jones said. She ran to a neighbor's house and telephoned
police.
   Albright confirmed that Carter was Kinison's bodyguard, but he
did not know how long they had been acquainted. Carter told police
he had recently arrived in Los Angeles from the South, Dinse said.
   Dinse said Kinison met Carter on Wednesday night at a private
party at a Hollywood club. The officer said that Kinison apparently
invited Carter to serve as a bodyguard, ``for lack a better term,''
and then later invited him to the house.
   Kinison, 36, is known for his screaming, foul-mouthed act that
has brought protests from women and gay groups and admiration from
mostly young, male crowds.

   Avianca pilots were not trained to use the
term ``fuel emergency,'' but common sense should have told air
traffic controllers that an Avianca jet was in trouble the night it
crashed, an Avianca pilot testified.
   Avianca Capt. Saul Pertuz, who testified Thursday, said the
controllers' argument that the flight crew in January's fatal crash
failed to use the right term was equal to ``demanding prescribed
phrases and leaving the common sense out of expressing an
emergency.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board is holding a hearing in
this town on New York's Long Island to determine how communications
broke down between controllers and the crew of the Avianca plane
that crashed on Long Island in January, leaving 73 people dead.
   Tapes of conversations between air traffic controllers and the
crew of the Avianca flight show that the pilots, while saying they
were low on fuel and wanted to land, did not use the term ``fuel
emergency.''
   Consequently, according to controllers who testified, the plane
received no priority to land that night.
   The term ``fuel emergency'' is a standard American term, but is
not always standard among international airlines. The Federal
Aviation Administration issued a bulletin shortly after the
accident, warning both pilots and controllers about the need to use
the specific terms.

   A fuel barge and a fishing boat collided
today in the morning fog, spilling less than 1,000 gallons of
gasoline into the ocean off of Rhode Island, authorities said.
   Gasoline poured from a 6-inch crack in the barge ST-85 about two
hours as the fuel was transferred to another tank, said Petty
Officer Paul Gerecke of the Marine Safety Office in Providence.
   ``It's not another World Prodigy,'' he said, referring to the
oil tanker that caused the state's worst oil spill last year.
   It was a year ago Saturday that the World Prodigy ran aground
off Newport, releasing 289,000 gallons of home heating oil into
Rhode Island Sound.
   Estimates of the amount of gasoline discharged into Block Island
Sound this morning were not immediately available, but at worst it
was 1,000 gallons, said Gerecke.
   ``When you're dealing with a sunny day like this and gasoline
it's gone almost immediately _ it's gone as soon as it leaks out,''
said Gerecke.
   In addition, the tide was heading out to sea and away from the
beaches.
   The crack was about two feet above the water line of the
360-foot barge, he said. The barge had a total cargo of 84,000
barrels, or 3.5 million gallons, but only 1,000 gallons of gasoline
was above the crack, he said.
   The collision occurred about four miles south of Weekapaug
Point, midway between the Galilee section of Narragansett and the
Watch Hill area of Westerly, he said. It is about 10 miles from the
spot where the World Prodigy ran aground on Brenton Reef.
   The fishing boat and barge rammed shortly before 7 a.m. when
there was ``zero visibility,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Dave
Brear.
   No injuries were reported.
   The barge, which is owned by the Tug New York Co. out of
Philadelphia, was being propelled by a tugboat, he said. Both the
barge and tug were being operated by Spentonbush-Red Star companies
of New York, he said.

<HEAD>IRS Says Many Ineligible People Claiming Tax Benefit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As much as 40 percent of a special tax benefit
for low-income families with children is being claimed by
ineligible persons, the Internal Revenue Service estimated today.
   As part of its audit program, the IRS found that in 1985, $818
million of the total $2.1 billion earned-income credit went to
those who were found to be ineligible. Credits totaling $6 billion
are expected to be claimed this year by more than 10 million
working families.
   The credit has strong support in both political parties.
President Bush has supported increases in the credit, and both
houses of Congress have agreed to boost the benefit as part of
rival child-care bills. Congressional leaders say the new IRS study
clouds those efforts.
   Steve Pyrek, an IRS spokesman, said the 40 percent error rate
first reported by The Washington Post is accurate but pointed out
that the estimate is based on a very limited sample of tax returns.
   ``The credit is an area where there are lots of errors in
computation because it is a very complex calculation,'' Pyrek said.
   The credit was enacted in 1975 to reward low-income workers who
hold a job rather than relying solely on welfare benefits. At that
time, the credit was viewed as basically an offset against Social
Security taxes.
   For 1990, the credit is for 14 percent of the first $6,810 of
wages and other earned income, a maximum benefit of $953. The
credit drops as wages rise, and is eliminated once income reaches
$20,264.
   A qualifying family that owes no federal income tax can get a
check from the government for up to $953. The credit may be paid in
advance throughout the year, through increased take-home pay, or
claimed when a tax return is filed the following year.

   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today
declared the rare northern spotted owl to be a threatened species,
but held up a specific plan for protection out of concern for
thousands of logging jobs in the Northwest.
   ``The biological evidence says the northern spotted owl is in
trouble,'' John Turner, head of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said
in announcing the owl will be protected under the Endangered
Species Act effective July 23. ``We will not and cannot by law
ignore that decision.''
   Designation as a threatened species would make it illegal to
harm any of the owls or destroy their critical habitat without
federal government approval.
   An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of spotted owl survive in the
ancient forests of Washington, Oregon and Northern California. An
Interior Department study has estimated that protecting the owl
would curtail logging over millions of acres and cost as many as
28,000 logging jobs over the next decade.
   ``I strongly believe there is room in the world for both owls
and loggers,'' Turner told reporters.
   ``Our intent now in the Fish and Wildlife Service and throughout
the administration is to find a way to protect the owl with the
least possible disruption of the timber economy of the Northwest,''
Turner said.
   Turner said it was a ``difficult and painful decision both for
the agency and me personally.''
   ``We remain convinced the Northwest can accommodate both logging
and owls,'' Ralph Morgenweck of the Fish and Wildlife Service told
members of Congress earlier.
   The formal protection plan wouldn't be released until next week.
   ``This issue is so complex it involves such a vast area that the
consequences could be harsh. ... Therefore this decision (on a
management plan) couldn't be made without taking into consideration
its impact,'' said Interior spokesman Mark Stephenson.
   A committee led by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas
announced in April that the northern spotted owl has lost about
two-thirds of its habitat since 1800. The panel recommended more
than 3 million acres of previously unprotected forests _ an area
nearly as large as Connecticut _ be set aside to preserve owl
habitat.
   The Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973 and has been used
to provide protection to the bald eagle and grizzly bear, among
other animals.
   Under the law, a designation of a threatened species means it is
likely to become extinct without protection, whereas extinction is
viewed as a certainty for an endangered species.
   The announcement comes on the heels of a declaration by
government scientists in April that the rare owl is likely to
become extinct unless millions of acres of habitat are created. The
owl's natural habitat is in the Northwest's oldest forests.
   Environmentalists have billed the decision as an important
precedent in a larger fight over protection of the forests because
the Forest Service earlier decided the health of the owl is a good
indicator of the overall condition of the forests themselves.
   Under one draft protection plan, the timber harvests permitted
on federal lands in the Northwest would be cut nearly in half, and
cost the region 28,000 direct timber-based jobs.
   Industry leaders predict a much greater impact. Rep. Denny
Smith, R-Ore., estimates a rippling effect in the economy could
touch as many as 75,000 workers.
   Forest Service chief F. Dale Robertson, lawmakers and industry
leaders have said implementation of the biological plan would carry
effects unprecedented under the Endangered Species Act.
   ``We've worked with endangered species before, but we've never
worked through something this huge with such high stakes and such a
high volume business,'' Robertson said recently.
   Environmentalists argue that job loss in the timber industry is
more the result of automation than forest protection.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
predicted in April that national timber harvests will increase 55
percent over the next half-century while industry employment will
fall about 27 percent as wood mills are modernized.
   Two years ago, the Fish and Wildlife Service decided against
declaring the owl as threatened. However, amid accusations of
high-level tampering in the Reagan administration, a federal judge
ordered the agency to review the owl's status.
   The Endangered Species Act applies to private as well as public
lands, but the vast majority of the owls live on the federally
owned lands of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
   Robertson has said his agency intends to implement most of the
Thomas report, which would designate owl habitat conservation areas
throughout the Pacific Northwest.
   But BLM, citing the effect on the timber-based economies of
Oregon, is pursuing alternatives that would lock up less land.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel's political
movement and its sister ally today formed the nation's first freely
elected non-Communist government in four decades.
   The state CTK news agency reported that the agreement was
reached at talks in the Slovak capital, Bratislava. Participants
were Havel, Prime Minister designate Marian Calfa and
representatives of the Civic Forum, its sister movement Public
Against Violence, the Christian Democratic Movement and the
Democratic Party.
   The Civic Forum and Public Against Violence, which led the
peaceful revolution that ousted the Communists from power last
November, won 170 seats in the 300-seat Parliament in June 8-9
elections.
   The incumbent government, also headed by Calfa, will resign next
Wednesday and the new government will be appointed by Havel, CTK
said.
   Agreement came two days after the Christian Democratic Movement,
which had first refused to join the new government, returned to
coalition talks.
   CTK did not give any names of ministers in the new 16-member
Cabinet and did not say how the ministries were distributed among
the parties.
   Informed sources in Prague indicated earlier this week that four
portfolios were being considered for the Christian Democrats.
   It was unclear whether the Democratic Party, which only won
seats in the Slovak regional Parliament, was to be included in the
government or was only present at the talks today.
   A Christian Democratic alliance of three loosely allied parties
won 40 seats in the elections, coming in third behind the
Communists with 47. The Christian Democratic Movement of Jan
Carnogursky, a former dissident like Havel and incumbent
Vice-Premier, is the largest in the Christian Democratic Union.
   The Christian Democratic Movement returned to the coalition
talks after its leadership reversed Carnogursky's earlier decision
to boycott them, a Civic Forum official said Wednesday.
   Civic Forum and Public Against Violence could have formed a
minority goverment but would have lacked the necessary three-fifths
majority needed in both chambers to push through key constitutional
changes.
   Officials from both groups had repeatedly stated they sought the
broadest possible coalition as the country embarks on a transition
to a market economy which will require drastic economic reform.

   Soldiers from three nations locked the doors
of Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold War
relic that symbolized a divided world.
   A U.S. Army band played a stirring song about old Berlin as the
rectangular white sentry station, a place East Germans died trying
to reach, was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history.
   The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall was closed with
an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from
the Germanys and the four World War II Allies.
   ``For 29 years Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War,'' U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a crowd of invited
guests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street.
   ``And now, 29 years after it was built, we meet here today to
dismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created.''
   Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the
foreign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys each
heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change.
   Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status as an
Allied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troops within six
months after the two German states unify, which could come in
December.
   The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and
distributed later to news media, apparently would also include the
Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper. The
United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000
troops in West Berlin.
   Berlin has been split into Soviet, U.S., British and France
sectors and West Berlin remains technically separate from West
Germany.
   The German and Allied foreign ministers are meeting in East
Berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united Germany's
role in world affairs.
   All borders are to be opened between the Berlins and the
Germanys by July 2, when the nations merge their economies.
   Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily,
and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint
Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.
   A color guard of French, British and American soldiers strode to
the building and locked the doors leading to each Allied nation's
compartment in the checkpoint.
   The giant crane then lifted the box-like building high into the
air. U.S. Army spokesman Sgt. Ed McCarthy said he believes it is
destined for a museum.
   Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from an East German
checkpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could be
crossed on foot by non-Germans.
   The ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents
of the buildings that line Friedrich Street, which had been divided
by the Berlin Wall since 1961.
   Illa Wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfold
just 20 yards below the fourth-floor apartment where she has lived
for 24 years.
   ``I saw eight people shot to death on that street,'' she said.
``I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard rail. He was
shot in the neck.''
   She said she also saw at least 20 successful escapes, by tunnel,
car and on foot.
   ``I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speeches here,'' she
said. ``I saw a James Bond movie filmed here. This is wonderful for
history but it is sad for me. It was part of my home.''
   East German construction worker Andreas Bratke was working near
the wall in January 1986 when he suddenly bolted through the East
German checkpoint, down Friedrich Street and through Checkpoint
Charlie.
   ``I ran as fast as I could,'' he said from his home in West
Berlin. ``Checkpoint Charlie is a very important place to me.''

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with remarks by U.S. expert, other material;

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has begun removing nuclear
warheads from some of its more volatile republics out of concern
that the weapons may fall into the hands of nationalist elements,
an administration official said today.
   ``It's the prudent thing to do,'' said the official, alluding to
the upheavals that have occurred in the Baltic region and in other
areas in the southeastern part of the country. The official asked
not to be identified.
   Stephen Meyer, an expert on the Soviet military and a professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Soviet
government officials told him of the consolidation.
   ``There is a consolidation going on,'' he said, adding it
appears the Soviets may also be concerned that warheads from a site
in a rebellious republic could be handed over to Iran or another
Third World country.
   The Wall Street Journal, which reported the story in today's
editions, said the Soviets have told American officials and experts
that they have consolidated control over 33,000 nuclear warheads.
The State Department had no comment on the report.
   The article said one Soviet concern is the possibility of a
breakdown of central authority in the country followed by civil war.
   A second concern involves the possible theft of nuclear weapons
in the event that a Soviet storage site were overrun by rebel
forces, it said.
   At the Soviet Embassy in Washington, spokesman Georgi V.
Shchekochikhin said he had no information that warheads had been
moved. He referred questions to the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
   The Journal article said the effort appears to focus on bringing
tactical nuclear weapons, such as short-range missiles, nuclear
artillery and bombs into the Russian republic.
   It added that the move is not believed to include long-range
strategic nuclear weapons and therefore does not constitute a
change in the superpower balance of forces.
   Meyer said it seemed from his conversations with Soviet
officials that the consolidation began after violence flared last
January between armed Azerbaijani and Armenian groups around the
city of Baku, where some nuclear warheads are believed to be
stored. Moscow sent Russian airborne units to stop the fighting,
but isolated attacks on military units in that area reportedly have
continued.
   Meyer said the consolidation involves both nuclear warheads and
conventional, or non-nuclear, armaments. He equated the move with a
U.S. decision in the 1970s to sharply reduce the number of nuclear
warhead storage sites in Western Europe in response to a rise in
terrorist threats against U.S. installations.

   Iranian workers using police dogs today
rescued thousands of people buried under the rubble of their homes
by an earthquake that killed about 29,000 people, official media
reported.
   In Geneva, a U.N. relief official said the Iranian Foreign
Ministry had told U.N. officials that 35,000 people were killed.
   At least 100 aftershocks continued to rattle the northern region
near the Caspian Sea, shaking the capital, Tehran, and causing new
landslides that trapped trucks carrying relief supplies.
   But a fleet of rescue helicopters and planes got through to
areas cut off by Thursday's quake. The planes brought tons of
supplies and carried out thousands of survivors.
   The earthquake measured at least 7.3 on the Richter scale and
struck at 12:30 a.m., while most Iranians were asleep. The temblor
was centered 125 miles northwest of Tehran.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said relief officials
had compiled a list of 28,950 dead and 28,198 injured. The Iranian
mission to the United Nations released a death toll of 25,000, and
said the count would likely rise as rescuers reached more remote
areas.
   Fabrizio Gentiloni of U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator's office
in Geneva said the Iranians told U.N. officials in Tehran that an
estimated 35,000 people were killed more than 100,000 injured.
   Most of the deaths were in two northern farming provinces, Gilan
and Zanjan, which have a combined population of 2.7 million, IRNA
said, with more than 25,000 people killed in coastal Gilan alone.
Telephone lines, electricity and water supplies were cut in the
provinces.
   The International Red Cross said in Geneva that radio reports
from the Red Crescent of Iran indicated that at least 400,000 were
left homeless.
   Iranian authorities did not immediately allow foreign-based
reporters to enter Iran to cover the disaster.
   Rescuers began using dogs today to search for survivors and
victims trapped beneath the mountains of debris. IRNA, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted an air force commander as saying the use of police
dogs ``yielded good results.''
   The commander, identified only as Gen. Naderian, said 6,000
victims, many injured but alive, were dug out and airlifted from
Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals in other cities.
   He said rain and poor visibility grounded some relief aircraft,
but they began getting through today. IRNA said 10 C-131 transport
planes and 30 Chinook helicopters helped evacuate victims after the
weather had improved.
   More than 3,000 tons of relief supplies have been flown to the
region in 50 trips by air force transport planes, Naderian said.
   Officials pleaded for blood, blankets and medicine, and other
countries promised to send supplies. An Iranian health official
said today there was no need for ``foreign blood'' because of
donations from Iranians.
   But he said hospitals needed surgical thread, blood bags,
orthopedic surgical equipment, medicines, tents, sheets and
blankets.
   Scenes on government TV showed young men desperately digging at
debris from flattened concrete buildings in Rasht, 175 miles
northwest of Tehran, with a population of 189,000 people.
Bulldozers and cranes lifted away larger pieces of debris.
Bulldozers also tried to clear roads for ambulances and other
rescue vehicles.
   Tehran Television, monitored in Cyprus, showed masked rescuers
in white aprons pulling dust-covered bodies from under concrete
slabs. The corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks,
apparently to keep them from decomposing.
   A dam south of Rasht burst, flooding the surrounding area, IRNA
said.
   Frightened survivors spent the night outdoors, afraid to go
home. In quake-devastated towns, women in black chadors flanked by
weeping children camped out in public squares.
   The TV showed villages in which 90 percent of the buildings were
destroyed. In one, an entire row of houses collapsed and slipped
down a hillside. In Tehran, crowds gathered in collection centers
donating blankets, food, kerosene heaters and fistfuls of cash.
   In the village of Ab-Dar in Zanjan, televison showed mountains
of rubble, and a speaker said it was all that was left of apartment
buildings. They appeared to have been shaken off their foundations,
collapsing like a deck of cards.
   The camera zoomed in on a stuffed toy rabbit and a child's shoe
lying in a street carpeted with dust.
   IRNA said at least 1,000 people were killed in Ab-Dar alone.
   The region is vulnerable to earthquakes because many homes are
built on flood plains of loosely deposited soil that shifts
violently in a quake. The primary construction materials are
ceramic bricks and unreinforced concrete, both of which crumble
easily.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, called the disaster a
``divine test'' and urged the bereaved residents of the stricken
provinces ``to pass this test with pride through patience and
cooperation.''
   Khamenei and President Hashemi Rafsanjani flew to the area to
supervise relief operations. Rafsanjani declared three days of
mourning.
   The Iranian Cabinet met in emergency session and called the
quake a ``sad, painful and horrible tragedy.'' It placed all
government organizations ``on full alert.''
   Offers of help poured in from around the world. Japan said today
it would send a rescue team and $500,000 in emergency aid. The
European Community promised $1.2 million in emergency relief, and
the United States offered humanitarian assistance. Even Iraq, one
of Iran's most bitter enemies, offered condolences and aid.
   President Bush sent a message of condolence to Rafsanjani along
with the U.S. offer of assistance. It was delivered to Iran by an
unidentified country because the United States does not have
diplomatic relations with Tehran.
   The earthquake was the worst since a quake registering 7.7 on
the Richter scale struck Iran on Sept. 16, 1978, killing 25,000
people. On Dec. 7, 1988, roughly the same number of people died in
a quake in nearby Soviet Armenia that registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale of ground motion.
   Thursday's temblor measured 7.3 on the Richter scale, the
Geophysics Center at Tehran University said. The U.S. Geological
Survey, however, measured it at 7.7.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A reading of 7 on the scale indicates a major
earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Palestinian Youth Killed, Jerusalem Area Under Curfew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GWEN ACKERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police imposed a rare curfew today in part of
Arab east Jerusalem after a Palestinian youth was shot and killed
during clashes with police, officials said.
   Paramilitary border police fired tear gas and live ammunition to
disperse rioters, who blocked roads and threw stones in the second
violent demonstration in the Silwan neighborhood since an earlier
death there Wednesday, Arab witnesses said.
   Officials at east Jerusalem's Mukassed hospital said police shot
Zuhri Ibrahim Shuweiki, 17, in the head. Police spokesman Uzi
Sandori confirmed only that a 17-year-old youth arrived dead at a
hospital after mass demonstrations in the hilly Silwan quarter.
   ``It is most likely he was shot by police officers,'' Sandori
added.
   He said the area was placed under curfew, confining its 8,300
residents to their homes.
   Israel radio said riots in Silwan began when hundreds of masked
Palestinian activists, armed with metal bars and stones, attacked a
police jeep. It said police opened fire with live ammunition after
the Arabs got ``dangerously'' close.
   After the curfew on Silwan was declared, many police officers
were seen advancing in the streets, using smoke grenades, the radio
said.
   One of the injured at Mukassed, who gave his name as Mohammed,
said the protesters were ``throwing stones at every police car.''
   Angry protesters took Shuweiki's body to a funeral in Silwan,
and about 1,000 Palestinians later marched in the village streets,
carrying outlawed Palestinian flags. Groups of protesters continued
to throw stones at policemen, Mohammed said.
   ``It was the most violent demonstration in Silwan since the
uprising began,'' he said. ``Everybody was in the streets, men,
women and children.''
   Shuweiki was the second Palestinian to be shot to death by
border police this week and the eighth to be killed in Jerusalem
during the 30-month revolt against Israeli occupation.
   At least six Israelis have been slain in Jerusalem during the
uprising, and 719 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers, police or civilians. Forty-five Israelis have been slain
by Palestinians. Also, about 225 Palestinians have been slain by
fellow Arabs, most on charges they collaborated with Israeli
authorities.
   Curfews in east Jerusalem are rare because they violate Israeli
policy that Jerusalem is a united sovereign city. The measure is
opposed by Mayor Teddy Kollek.
   East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan along with the West Bank
in the 1967 Middle East War. Israel annexed the area, but most
Western nations, including the United States, do not recognize the
action. Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their
independent state.
   Silwan, where Shuweiki was killed, is an Arab village that was
annexed along with east Jerusalem.

   Lawyers tried today to persuade a federal
judge to call off the execution of ``Black Widow'' killer Judi
Buenoano, claiming Florida's electric chair can malfunction and
torture her to death.
   U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett, who granted Ms. Buenoano a
temporary stay of execution Thursday, heard more testimony today on
her appeal based largely on a malfunction that shot flames above
the head of the last executed inmate.
   Ms. Buenoano, 47, was sentenced to death for the fatal arsenic
poisoning of her husband. She also was convicted of drowning her
paralyzed teen-age son and trying to kill a boyfriend in a car
bombing.
   Ronald Thornton, maintenance supervisor at Florida State Prison,
testified today that the prison has no specific test to detect a
faulty or damaged head electrode, saying the electrode was visually
inspected after the last execution.
   Thornton said an attempt to ``energize'' the electrical system
on the Monday after the execution of Jesse Tafero on May 4 resulted
in a power failure in the part of the prison that includes the
death chamber.
   A check showed a break in one of the feeder cables to the system
that Thornton said was old, but he testified that this ``had
nothing to do with the Tafero execution.''
   Prison Superintendent Thomas L. Martin Jr. said the last
execution made it ``abundantly clear to everybody that we had a
problem we hadn't had before.'' But he said a wet sponge on
Tafero's head, the state's explanation for the malfunction, ``was
the only thing that could have gone wrong.''
   Fred A. Leuchter Jr., who designs and manufactures execution
systems and hardware, said that a faulty electrode caused sparks,
flames and smoke at Tafero's head.
   Leuchter and Ms. Buenoano's lawyer, Jay Nickerson, contended
that Tafero had suffered cruel and needless torture before he died
and the problem had not been corrected.
   Fawsett ordered a temporary halt to Thursday's scheduled 12:01
p.m. execution about four hours before Ms. Buenoano was to die.
   The Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected similar claims
that an electrode in the electric chair was broken during the
Tafero electrocution.
   The state argued that the smoke and flame around Tafero's head
was caused by a synthetic sponge attached to the electrode. It has
been replaced and everything is in working order for the next
execution, the Department of Corrections has said.
   Assistant Attorney General Margene Roper on Thursday repeated
contentions by prison officials that Tafero did not suffer and was
dead after the first of three surges of electricity.
   Leuchter called Florida's chair a makeshift device, poorly made
and maintained.
   He said corrosion or a break in an electrode resulted in a
non-lethal charge that did not kill Tafero until he was jolted
three times over a period of several minutes.
   One woman has been executed in the United States since the
Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976. North
Carolina killed Velma Barfield by lethal injection in 1984 for
poisoning her boyfriend.
   Ms. Buenoano was condemned to death for the slaying of Air Force
Sgt. James E. Goodyear in Orlando in 1971.
   She also was convicted of killing her paralyzed son, Michael
Goodyear, 19, by pushing him from a canoe in a 1980 outing and of
attempted murder in a car bombing that injured her boyfriend, John
Gentry, in 1983.

<TEXT>
   State high-school teachers have voted to
boycott university entrance exams, endangering the chances of
thousands of students who have applied to enter universities in
Greece and abroad.
   The Federation of Higher Education Personnel, which represents
nearly 60,000 high-school teachers nationwide, overwhelmingly voted
Thursday to continue a strike over pay and conditions.
   ``We will stage 24-hour strikes whenever the government
reschedules the exams,'' said one union official, who refused to be
identified.
   The exams conducted by the state high-school teachers were
originally set for June 14.
   The teachers want $107 more a month in pay and a reduction in
the number of hours they must teach each week.
   High-school teachers receive a starting salary of about $476 a
month, which can rise to $833 a month. They must teach 21 hours
each week and want that cut to 18 hours a week.

   Firefighters extinguished a blaze at a Siberian
oil tank farm that was started by lightning and spread to 22 acres,
the evening newspaper Izvestia said Friday.
   The newspaper said it took firefighters a full day to put out
the blaze at the Karkateyevy station, in the Tyumen oil region of
Western Siberia.
   The Tass news agency said Thursday the fire began after
lightning struck a reservoir at the station Wednesday night. The
blaze spread to four of the station's 24 tanks, Tass said.
   There were no injuries and no need for evacuations, said the
Izvestia report. Regional officials said negligence was partly to
blame for the fire.
   ``Lightning rods were not working, and there was no special foam
to extinguish the blaze,'' it said. ``Also, taps on the pipes were
not working and oil was going through them while they were
burning.''
   There was no estimate of damage or oil loss.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said today that a united
Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during
which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country. The
United States rejected the proposal, a U.S. official said.
   The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the
strategic future of a united Germany.
   The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The Associated
Press, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the
Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.
   But in exchange, Western and Soviet troops would pull out of the
country and Germany's own military strength would be sharply
reduced, according to the proposal.
   Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain,
France and the two German states.
   ``I am underwhelmed,'' Baker said when asked about the Soviet
proposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could
join NATO. The official said the other Western ministers expressed
the same reservations.
   The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been
staunchly opposed.
   West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is a
member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the
strength of the German armed forces and ``to revamp their structure
to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive
operations.''
   It said those reductions could be undertaken over a three-year
period. Germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying
chemmical or nuclear weapons.
   It also said that within six months of unification, all Western
troops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically under
military occupation by the United States, France and Britian.
   The four nations would reduce their military forces in the
country during a three-year period following unification first by
50 percent, then ``bring them down to a level of token contingents,
or completely withdraw them from Germany.''
   There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, while a
quarter-million U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany along
with tens of thousands of British and French soldiers.
   Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in what
is now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear the
exact plans for pulling them out.
   Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of
the Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four
Powers' troops out of ``greater Berlin'' within six months after
unification.
   The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and
distributed to the news media, apparently would also include the
Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper.
   The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated
12,000 troops in West Berlin. An official reached by telephone in
the office of the military attache at the Soviet embassy in East
Berlin said there were no Soviet troops stationed in the city
proper.

   From her window, Virginia Spence can see
the road to the nursing home where she may have to move if
officials close the Shenandoah County Farm, the last county-run
poorhouse in Virginia.
   The farm where Ms. Spence came to live in 59 years ago during
the Great Depression is an anachronism, a quaint evocation of a
more compassionate age. It may also be an unaffordable luxury for a
rural county faced with bills for school improvements and other
priorities.
   ``The county supervisors, they don't give a damn about this
place,'' said the farm's director and caretaker, Delford Keckley,
stamping on a sagging board in the kitchen floor. ``At one time
every county, just about, had an alms house, a place where you
could go if you had no other place. ... Now it's just the state, or
Social Security or what have you that looks after people. It's not
the same.''
   The drab 18th century farmhouse tucked between folds in the
green and purple hills of northwestern Virginia is home to six
indigents, several of whom cannot remember living anywhere else.
   At one time, the farm's population was as high was 40, Keckley
said. The residents lived communally, dividing chores and raising
and slaughtering most of their own food. State licensing
regulations eventually forbade that.
   The 265-acre farm was a gift to the poor of Shenandoah County
from Revolutionary War Gen. Peter Muhlenberg in 1783. It is open to
any county resident who can prove indigency.
   It is the only home in Virginia run solely by a county for its
poor residents, officials said. In at least one other case, several
Virginia counties and towns operate joint homes for the indigent.
   County officials and Keckley believe it may be the last
county-run poorhouse in the nation, although there has been no
formal accounting of such institutions.
   The poorhouse costs the county $91,000 annually, and
improvements to meet proposed fire code requirements could cost
between $80,000 and $100,000, County Administrator John D. Cutlip
said.
   ``You can look at the other 94 counties in Virginia and see that
they have done away with their alms houses. Clearly it was
something they thought they could not afford,'' Cutlip said.
   After weeks of debate this spring, county officials decided to
keep the farm open another year while searching for grants or
historical preservation money to lighten the financial load.
   At a public meeting, county residents seemed to support keeping
the poorhouse open, but few endorsed a proposed 4-cent increase in
the real estate tax rate to pay for repairs, Cutlip said.
   Keckley, 67, has sparred with Cutlip and the Board of
Supervisors frequently in his 10 years at the farm. A
barrel-chested man with a gap-toothed smile and cackling laugh, he
is self-appointed watchdog for the interests of some of his older
charges.
   ``I don't know where they'd go,'' Keckley said. ``It would be a
sin. Some of these nursing homes around here ain't fit to put your
dog in.''
   Cutlip counters that the farm's residents might be better off
without it. ``They can be served elsewhere and in many cases in
newer facilities,'' he said.
   Cutlip also noted many people eligible to live at the farm have
chosen other options in recent years. ``I'm assuming since there is
a declining population at the farm, people are finding the other
options attractive.''
   But for Virginia Spence, the other options are not attractive
and the future is suddenly troubling. ``I just don't know,'' she
said in a thin, stumbling voice. ``I don't want to go.''

   Despite Iran's history of diplomatic isolation, the world
community rushed to offer assistance after the devastating
earthquake that killed at least 29,000 people. One report put the
death toll at 35,000.
   Two of Iran's most bitter enemies, Iraq and the United States,
offered sympathy and humanitarian aid.
   ``I convey ... my sincerest condolences and declare that we are
ready to provide any assistance you may require,'' Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein said in a message to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   Iran fought Iraq in the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war.
   The first team of French doctors into earthquake-ravaged Iran
set up a center to treat the wounded today. Iranian officials said
11 emergency headquarters had been set up throughout the region.
   Five medical workers with Doctors Without Borders set up an
emergency center for the injured at an air force hospital in
Tehran, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Twenty-five more French doctors and nurses, 50 tons of medical
supplies, water, temporary shelters and two all-terrain vehicles
were scheduled to leave this afternoon.
   The French government promised to send a civil defense team of
195 people and 18 search dogs, along with 24 tons of equipment.
   In Geneva, a senior U.N. relief official said that according to
a report by the Tehran government, an estimated 35,000 people had
been killed and more than 100,000 injured.
   Fabrizio Gentiloni of the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator's
office said the estimates were received from the Iranian Foreign
Ministry.
   The Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross,
reported that by midnight Thursday, 12,000 bodies had been
recovered and 20,000 injured were taken to hospitals. The Red
Crescent also said at least 400,000 people were left homeless.
   The Greek Red Cross planned to send 15 tons of supplies to Iran,
and Japan pledged relief funds and goods worth more than $1.5
million. Officials said Japanese rescuers would leave for Iran
today, bringing equipment such as sound detectors to help find
people trapped beneath rubble.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
expressed condolences to the Iranian government and the families of
the victims of Thursday's earthquake, which leveled scores of towns
and villages in northern Iran.
   Perez de Cuellar, in a message to Rafsanjani, said Thursday the
U.N. system was ready to provide all possible assistance. Its
disaster relief coordinator dispatched an emergency team, and an
airlift of emergency supplies from U.N. warehouses was undertaken
in coordination with Iranian authorities, officials said.
   A statement from the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva
said the most immediate needs were for medicine, medical supplies
and tents. Other needs include canned food, blankets, clothing,
vehicles and heavy-duty equipment.
   The organization was sending a senior officer and relief
coordination officer to the stricken areas, and a special task
force was established at the Iranian president's office to
coordinate relief, the U.N. said.
   The Iranian government already has allocated $14 million for
relief.
   In Brussels, the European Community agreed to donate $1.2
million to help send emergency relief equipment to the area, it was
announced.
   The British Red Cross announced it would give $17,300 for
blankets, medical equipment, food and emergency lighting for
victims of the earthquake.
   A private British charity, the International Rescue Corp., sent
a 17-member rescue team to Iran today after receiving a request for
help from Iranian officials, according to team coordinator Terry
Price.
   He said the team, which includes two paramedics, took along
equipment including heat-seeking devices, ultrasonic listening
equipement, portable thermic lancers for cutting through debris and
portable satellite communications gear.
   The group, formed by British firefighters in 1979, has had
rescue experience in earthquakes in Mexico City, El Salvador and
Armenia.
   Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in
Washington, said the organization was raising money rather than
shipping the supplies, and had established a toll-free nationwide
telephone number for people wanting to make contributions.
   ``We're attempting to raise money to send to the Red Crescent
Society to help buy tents, blankets, food, medical supplies and
emergency lighting,'' he said.
   AmeriCares, based in New Canaan, Conn., said in a statement that
it was ready to send containers of medicine and other relief
supplies to Iran ``as soon as clearance has been received from the
Iranian government to land our aircraft in that country.''
   President Bush's administration offered humanitarian assistance
and sent a message of condolence to the government.
   The messages was delivered to Iran by another unidentified
country because the United States has not had diplomatic relations
with Tehran since 1979, when Iranian militants took Americans
hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The hostages were held for
444 days.

   Land now being used for a military exercise
soon will be a place for some plain old exercise.
   A mock operation in suburban Fairview Township is giving
soldiers armed with M-16 rifles and bulldozers some practice
grading a landing strip under combat conditions and helping the
community build a new soccer field.
   Col. Clyde Hornberger, commander of the 315th Engineer Group at
the New Cumberland Army Depot, said the Army exercise will continue
for two weeks.
   The rough grading will save the township about $150,000, but
won't cost the Army extra, because the corps conducts two-week
operations similar to this each year, said Charles Bender, chairman
of the township Board of Supervisors.
   U.S. Secretary of the Army Michael P.W. Stone last week gave the
Army Corps permission to begin the project.
   Northern York County has been without a soccer field since
chemical contamination from an abandoned Army landfill forced the
Marsh Run Park to close in 1987, Bender said.

<HEAD>Colin Powell Says Deep Military Cuts Would Break Military's Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top military officer, Gen. Colin
Powell, jumped into the thick of the battle over the Pentagon
budget today, saying quick and severe cuts in military spending
would break ``the back of our armed forces.''
   ``If you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a peace
dividend, you will have neither,'' Powell said in a speech prepared
for delivery to the National Press Club.
   The speech was the general's first major address on the debate
over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of
lessened East-West tensions.
   Powell, a former national security advisor, was sworn in as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff nine months ago. In that
role, he serves as the president's primary military counselor and
coordinator of the nations' military leaders.
   The general said that even though the Berlin Wall has fallen
during that time and the Warsaw Pact has nearly evaporated, he has
been called upon to put American men and women in uniform in harm's
way.
   ``I have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman
that this is still a dangerous world and that you'd better be able
to respond if someone challenges your interests,'' he said, citing
Panama, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, Europe and Korea as
examples.
   Powell said that while the Soviet Union has experienced dramatic
change, its military retains the capability of destroying the
United States with nuclear weaponry within 30 minutes.
   ``We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a
decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the
enduring realities we face,'' Powell said.
   He noted that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier this week
put forward a plan for cutting the military forces by 25 percent
over five years, signalling that ``we are willing to examine any
reasonable proposal.''
   But Powell also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as ``a realistic, prudent response''
to the changing world.
   That plan, the general said, will begin to reduce the nation's
forces over time. ``On this glide path we will reach a base force
which I believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match
enduring defense needs with enduring realities,'' Powell said.
   ``We know we will get smaller. That is inevitable,'' Powell
said. But if Bush's budget request is cut back significantly, ``you
will force us to start breaking faith'' with the nation's
all-volunteer force.
   ``You will force us to start breaking the back of our armed
forces,'' he said.
   The general also took aim at those, primarily on Capitol Hill,
who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time.
Although he named no names, House Armed Services Chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., has been sharply critical of Cheney's 25 percent
plan, and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has
complained about ``blanks'' in Cheney's budget.
   Chiding ``people who clamor for new strategies, new vision, new
thinking,'' Powell asked such critics for time to plan for a
gradual reduction of forces.
   ``We are looking ahead with our eyes open. We're cutting
programs. We want to close bases. We've frozen construction and
hiring. We're cutting troops, we're cutting generals,'' the general
said.
   ``What we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins,
what we need is breathing space. We need to time to make the plans
work,'' Powell said.

   It's just not fair.
   Lisa Rapp gets paid $30 an hour to do absolutely nothing. Her
boss thinks she's great. Incredibly, there are some workaholics who
actually applaud her brazen indolence.
   To her credit, Ms. Rapp doesn't waste time hanging out with
gossips around the water cooler. In fact, she doesn't say a word.
She scarcely breathes. She hardly ever blinks, and never scratches
her nose.
   Ms. Rapp is a ``living mannequin'' who spends weekends modeling
clothes at local shopping malls. She stands motionless in high
heels and stares blankly for two hours at a stretch, broken only by
quick costume changes every 15 minutes.
   It's not as easy as it looks, she says.
   Especially when your feet are killing you, you're sweating in
the hot lights and kids are yanking on your sleeves. Or when some
leering bozo is yelling ``Hi, sweetie'' and trying to tempt you
with his hot dog or a sip of his Coke.
   ``It's fun when you're able to fool the public and make them
think you're not real,'' she says, ``but the hardest part is the
great deal of mental concentration it takes to ignore everyone
around you.''
   Frank Barone, president of the Barone modeling agency in
suburban Alexandria, Va., agrees that standing in high heels for
long hours is tiring work.
   ``A two-hour job isn't too bad, but four hours is tough and six
hours is exhausting. You really have to be in shape,'' he said.
   Ms. Rapp, a lithe, cheerful 24-year-old who works as a doctor's
assistant during the week, gets top dollar on her do-nothing
weekends. Barone says she's one of his most photogenic models and
always attracts big crowds.
   ``When I see her long neck and turned-up nose, I think of Helen
of Troy, the face that launched a thousand ships,'' he says.
   Barone said his mannequin models like their work because ``all
of them want to be looked at and admired,'' but Ms. Rapp says her
biggest kick is winning the battle of wits with her gawkers.
   ``People don't like to be ignored, and that's what I'm doing.
I'm ignoring people. I think people just hate that,'' she says with
a laugh.
   Her secrets?
   ``I think plastic and unresponsive,'' she said. ``I push them
away with my mind. I try to avoid eye contact and concentrate on
something like the intersection of tiles on the wall. If my nose
itches, I simply ignore it. When my eyes start watering from the
air conditioning and I have to blink, I blink one eye at a time,
very quickly.''
   Only twice in nearly two years of modeling has Ms. Rapp lapsed
into giggles. Once was when a small boy mashed his face against the
store window and gaped in awe until his mother yanked him away.
   ``The other time, a woman had walked around me several times
before she came up close. She reached up my long-sleeved blouse to
pull out the price tag and when she felt warm flesh, she shrieked
and jumped back. We both broke out laughing.''
   Ms. Rapp's audiences occasionally burst into applause over her
virtuoso act.
   ``I can't smile in response, but I'm really happy that someone
is pleased at what I'm doing, even though I'm not doing anything at
all,'' she said.

   Nelson Mandela, symbol of black African
liberation, urged the United Nations today to maintain sanctions
against South Africa until apartheid is abolished and warned of
danger from armed white racists.
   Calling apartheid a ``crime against humanity,'' Mandela said,
``We strongly urge that there should be no relaxation of existing
measures. The sanctions that have been imposed by the United
Nations and by individual governments should remain in place.''
   In remarks to the U.N. Committee Against Apartheid, Mandela also
issued a warning against white racists among civilians, the army
and police in South Africa.
   ``There are many among our white compatriots who are still
committed to the maintenance of the evil system of white minority
domination,'' he said. Some are ideoligically committed to racism,
while others fear democratic majority rule, he added.
   ``Some of these are to be found within the army and the police.
... Other whites are working at a feverish pace ot establish
paramilitary groups whose stated aim is the physical liquidation of
the African National Congress.''
   Mandela, deputy president of the ANC, said: ``We cannot afford
to underestimate the threat that these defenders of a brutal and
continuing reality pose to the whole process of working towards a
just political settlement.''
   Mandela extended greetings to ``the peoples of Palestine'' who
are fighting for liberation and human rights. ``We commend their
struggles to you,'' he said.
   But he made no mention of the Palestine Liberation Organization
or its leader, Yasser Arafat, whom he has called a ``comrade in
arms.'' Mandela also has said he supports Israel's right to exist.
   Mandela arrived to a standing ovation at the United Nations for
what was generally regarded as the most important adress of his
U.S. tour. The United nations had demanded for years that he be
released from prison, where he spent 27 years for his
anti-apartheid struggle before he was set free this year.
   Several hundred delegates, dignitaries and celebrities cheered
for several minutes as Mandela entered the packed hall, waving both
hands and smiling. Among the guests invited were Mayor David
Dinkins, boxer Joe Frazier, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, boxing promoter
Don King, boxers Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson and theater director
Joseph Papp.
   As Mandela spoke, a radar-equipped police launch cruised close
offshore in the East River as part of strict security to protect
him. A South Africa newspaper reported Friday that a white racist
group, including a former Nazi, had plotting to kill Mandela and
President F.W. de Klerk, who released Mandela.
   South Africa, a U.N. member, was ousted from the 159-member
General Assembly in 1974 and was not represented in the hall. The
United States is not a member of the committee, but three top
ambassadors were present.
   The United Nations has for years led the battle against
apartheid in the international arena. The 159-nation body has
denounced South Africa's system of racial segregation, called for
the establishment of a non-racial democracy and backed sanctions
against South Africa. In his current 14-nation tour, Mandela has
been urging that such sanctions be kept in place in order to keep
up the pressure on South Africa's government.
   United Nations efforts to win Mandela's release date back at
least to 1976, when the General Assembly proclaimed an annual day
of solidarity with all South African political prisoners. In 1982
it endorsed a campaign, joined by 2,000 mayors worldwide, for the
release of Mandela and other prisoners.
   Since 1962, the General Assembly has urged the council to impose
mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa. But the assembly
only can make recommendations and the United States and Britain
have vetoed efforts in the council to mandate certain sanctions.
   In a special General Assembly session in mid-December, the
assembly agreed without a dissenting vote that ``while the
apartheid system in south Africa persists, the peoples of Africa as
a whole cannot achieve justice, human dignity and peace.''
   Apartheid, it said, is ``a crime against the conscience and
dignity of mankind.''

   A city lawyer who has pleaded guilty to drug
charges testified today that he found Mayor Marion Barry slumped on
a bathroom toilet seat during an alleged crack-smoking spree with
another man.
   James McWilliams, a lawyer for the Department of Public Works,
also testified at Barry's trial on drug and perjury charges that he
lied to police shortly after the incident to protect Barry from a
drug investigation.
   McWilliams testified that he went to the hotel room of Charles
Lewis, who is a convicted drug dealer, on Dec. 19, 1988, to talk to
the mayor about a job transfer.
   When McWilliams got there, Lewis asked him for $40 and ``I
understood he was going to go out and get some drugs'' with the
money, said McWilliams. Lewis came back with a ``baggy ... that had
a white substance inside,'' he testified.
   Barry arrived at the hotel room, the mayor and Lewis went into
the bathroom repeatedly and smoke emanated from the bathroom, said
McWilliams. The lawyer said he sat on the bed watching Monday Night
Football and drinking cognac.
   ``The smoke and the ... smell ... got stronger as the evening
went on,'' said McWilliams. The witness did not say that he
actually saw Barry using drugs.
   Did McWilliams mention his request for a new job assignment?
asked assistant U.S. attorney Richard Roberts.
   ``Several times,'' said McWilliams. ``I didn't think I was
getting through. ... He was sitting on the commode with all his
clothes on and he was just slumped over a little bit,'' said
McWilliams. ``I kept making my pitch about the job.''
   ``He looked up and said, `you know, you look a lot like Santa
Claus','' testified McWilliams, who has a beard.
   Lewis testified at Barry's U.S. District Court trial that he and
Barry smoked crack cocaine that night during the televised Monday
Night Football game.
   When police launched an investigation after Barry's visits to
Lewis' hotel room, McWilliams said, he lied to authorities by
denying that he had seen any narcotics in Lewis' room.
   Why didn't McWilliams tell the truth? asked Roberts.
   ``I didn't tell the truth because I was protecting Marion
Barry,'' said McWilliams.
   McWilliams said Barry was ``someone who I respected'' and that
the mayor's ``services to the city and civil rights were something
I considered important.''
   ``I didn't want to be the one causing any problems,'' said
McWilliams, a former assistant attorney general in the Virgin
Islands.
   In January, McWilliams pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting
Lewis' possession of cocaine. He is now cooperating with
prosecutors.
   On Thursday, Barry's lawyer maintained that Lewis is a liar who
fabricated allegations that the mayor smoked crack cocaine.
   The defense attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said Lewis gave
conflicting testimony about Barry's supposed drug use to keep
himself out of prison.
   ``You care for Charles Lewis,'' Mundy told Lewis at the end of
two days of cross-examination in U.S. District Court.
   ``You care for yourself first,'' Lewis agreed.
   ``That's exactly it,'' Mundy shot back. Lewis faces sentencing
in a drug case in his native Virgin Islands and the Justice
Department is holding back a recommendation of leniency until his
role as a cooperating witness is finished, Mundy said.
   Lewis lied in January 1989 when he denied any involvement with
drugs, Mundy said, and began lying in August 1989 when he started
to implicate Barry.
   ``If you would lie in January 1989 ... you would lie in August
1989 to the present,'' the defense lawyer suggested.
   ``No,'' Lewis said.
   Police found traces of cocaine on a table and night stand in
Lewis' room shortly after he checked out of the hotel, according to
a document introduced as evidence at the trial by prosecutors.
Defense attorneys stipulated to the accuracy of the document.
   Barry, who is completing his third term as mayor of the nation's
capital, is being tried on three felony counts of perjury, one
misdemeanor count of conspiracy and nine counts of cocaine
possession.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany gave final approval today
to the economic merger with East Germany, a move that will
effectively unite the two countries after 40 years of Cold War
division.
   Parliament's upper house, or Bundesrat, passed the state treaty
a day after the East German parliament and the powerful lower house
of the West German parliament approved it.
   With the decision, the mighty West German mark becomes the
official currency in East Germany on July 2. The historic pact
marks the de facto unification of Germany and the end of 40 years
of communism in East Germany.
   Also today, the Soviet Union said a united Germany can join NATO
after a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and
U.S. troops would leave the country. The United States rejected the
proposal, a U.S. official said.
   The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the
strategic future of a united Germany.
   Shevardnadze also proposed the withdrawal of the Allies' troops
from Berlin six months after German unification. That plan
apparently includes Soviet soldiers stationed just outside East
Berlin.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could
join NATO. The official said the other Western ministers expressed
the same reservations.
   The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been
staunchly opposed.
   There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, and
250,000 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of British and French
soldiers are stationed in West Germany.
   There was little reaction when the president of the West German
Bundesrat, Walter Momper, polled each of the 11 West German states
on whether they approved the treaty on economic, monetary and
social unification.
   By contrast, loud applause and standing ovations greeted passage
of the treaty in East Berlin and the lower house in Bonn Thursday.
   Only the West German states of Lower Saxony and Saarland voted
to reject the treaty. They are Social Democratic strongholds, and
Saarland is the home state of Social Democratic chancellor
candidate Oskar Lafontaine, the most vocal opponent of the pact.
   Lafontaine was not in the chamber for today's debate. He was on
vacation.
   The opposition Social Democrats, who control the chamber, had
criticized the speed with which unity was approaching and what they
saw as the treaty's lack of adequate support for East Germans after
socialist support systems fall to free-market rules.
   But they said they would not torpedo the pact because of the
high expectations for German unification that have mounted since
the fall of the Berlin Wall in November.
   Some experts have predicted up to 2 million unemployed in East
Germany as outmoded government-owned factories and businesses try
to compete. More than a third of the enterprises are expected to
close, and there are fears social unrest could result.
   West Germans fear the high cost of unification, and worry about
the possibility of higher taxes and inflation.
   Political unification is now seen as a possibility before year's
end, and the conservative Christian Democrats of West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have called for all-German elections in
December.
   East Germany's hard-line Communist regime fell amid massive
demonstrations last fall, giving way to elections in March that
brought to power the country's first non-Communist government that
immediately began negotiating unification.
   But before Germany can become one again the international
ramifications of unification, such as the new Germany's military
status, are to be resolved in negotiations between the two Germanys
and the Allies.
   Both German parliaments on Thursday approved a resolution
recognizing Poland's western border, the Oder-Neisse rivers, as
final.
   ``Both sides declare that they will not raise territorial claims
now or in the future,'' the resolution said.
   The issue had become one of the most emotional in the run-up to
full German unification. Poles feared a united Germany might try to
retake former territories lost to Poland after World War II, and
ultra-conservative West Germans saw the return of the territories
as homeland rights.
   Kohl's reticence to clearly recognize the Polish border only
fueled concerns. In March, after international and domestic
criticism, he called for the resolution that was passed Thursday
night.

<HEAD>Personal Spending Flat in May as Consumer Caution Grows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal spending was flat in May, the
government said Friday in a report indicating growing caution among
consumers who have been a major source of strength for the economy
during seven years of growth.
   ``The consumer clearly has pulled back in a dramatic fashion,''
said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
in New York.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending remained
unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.66 trillion
after seven straight months of gains, including 0.5 percent in
April and 0.3 percent in March.
   But even the April and March advances were weaker than first
thought. They were revised downward from 0.6 percent and 0.5
percent reported last month.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
since it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity.
   Analysts have cited a poor job market and weak wage increases
for the flagging consumer confidence.
   Indeed, the Commerce Department said personal incomes rose just
0.3 percent in May for a second straight month, to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.70 trillion. The identical gains
followed three consecutive monthly advances of 0.8 percent and were
the lowest since a 0.2 percent increase last September.
   The income gains have not even matched the inflation rate,
observed economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a Washington
management consulting firm. ``Certainly, consumers are feeling the
pinch, she said.''
   Friday's report was the latest indicating a slowdown in consumer
spending, which has been a driving force for much of the current
economic expansion now in its eighth year.
   The Commerce Department reported last week that retail sales
fell in May, their third consecutive monthly decline. It was the
first time retail sales fell for three straight months since the
summer of 1981 during the last recession. Retail sales represent
about half of overall consumer spending.
   And the department on Thursday revised downward its previous
estimate of consumer spending in the first quarter.
   Nevertheless, Roach said the slow pace of consumer spending is
not likely to tip the economy into a recession ``since there are
other things out there still boosting the economy.''
   Roach cited a second Commerce Department report Friday showing
that orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
at least three years _ jumped 3.9 percent in May.
   Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in
West Chester, Pa., said there have been some signs recently of a
manufacturing rebound.
   ``Exports are healthy and inventories are rather low, which
bodes okay for a pickup in manufacturing and durable goods over the
next six months,'' Getman said.
   The difference between incomes and spending in May helped
improve Americans' savings rate. The rate _ savings as a percent of
disposable income _ rose to 6.2 percent following a 6.0 percent
rate in April and a 6.3 percent rate in March. The March rate was
the highest in five years.
   A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital
since more funds thus would be available domestically for business
investment.
   The report said Americans' income after taxes increased 0.2
percent, the same rate as in April. The key component of the income
category _ wages and salaries _ rose $10.3 billion after a $16.4
billion gain in April.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods fell $12.6
billion after an $8.5 billion gain in April. Durable goods
purchases had fallen the previous two months.
   Purchases of non-durable goods were down $500 million in May,
their third consecutive decline. Spending on services slowed to
$13.1 billion after a $14.7 billion gain in April and a $19.6
billion advance in March.

<HEAD>Colonel Testifies Beating Palestinians Was Norm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLEN SCHECHET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli colonel accused of ordering
soldiers to break the limbs of Palestinians testified Friday that
beatings were ``part of the accepted norm in that period'' of the
Palestinian uprising.
   Testifying in his own defense, Col. Yehuda Meir told three
military judges that his superiors did not question the beatings
because ``there was nothing special in it.... There was nothing out
of the ordinary.''
   Meir testified Thursday that former Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin gave orders in January 1988 to break the bones of Palestinian
inciters as punishment.
   Rabin rejected Meir's contention in an interview Friday on
Israel Radio. He said he ordered the army to beat rioters only to
bring them under control.
   Meir, 37, is being court-martialed on seven felony counts. The
most serious charge _ causing bodily harm with malicious intent _
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment.
   Military prosecutors say soldiers acting on Meir's orders
arrested about 21 Palestinians in two West Bank villages in January
1988, took them into nearby fields and beat the bound and gagged
detainees with rifles and clubs.
   At least 12 Palestinians from the villages of Hawara and Beita
were reported to have had their limbs broken in the two incidents.
   Israeli military authorities introduced beatings as a method to
deter Arab demonstrators a month after the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in
December 1987.
   Meir admitted ordering beatings but said he now feels abandoned
by Rabin and by Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the former military
commander of the West Bank and Meir's former commanding officer.
   ``I feel like they abandoned me and threw me to the dogs,'' Meir
told the judges. He began to cry minutes later and asked for a
recess.
   Mitzna testified last month that beatings were not to be
administered as punishment but were only intended to disperse
protesters and control detainees. He was a prosecution witness.
   Meir resumed his testimony after a 30-minute break. He accused
his superior officers of ``double bookkeeping.'' He said they spoke
``in two different directions with two different voices'' _ one for
``those who have to do the work'' and the other for the news media,
the U.S. government, the legal system and left-wing Israeli public
officials.
   He also said he had been opposed to the policy of beatings,
which was begun at a time when soldiers were more restricted in
their use of gunfire.
   The beatings inevitably resulted in excessive use of force and
did not deter Palestinian demonstrators, Meir said.
   ``The soldiers were satisfied.... They could vent all their
anger, all their frustration,'' he testified. ``In essence, the
army started to behave like hooligans.''
   Meir rejected the testimony of two soldiers who said he ordered
them to break an arm or leg of a 14-year-old Palestinian before
releasing him.
   One of the soldiers ``was not telling the truth,'' Meir said.
   He suggested that the other soldier might have mistakenly
identified him because the jacket he was wearing concealed his rank.
   Meir was reprimanded for his conduct and placed on leave without
pay from the army. Israel's Supreme Court, responding to a lawsuit
by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, ordered military
prosecutors to put Meir on trial. The court-martial began March 29.

   A Norwegian insurance company has offered up
to $277,000 compensation to each of the families of 158 people who
died in a fire on the Scandinavian Star ferry.
   The settlement to the families and to some 300 survivors
exceeded the company's legal obligation. Espen Komnaes, the
families' attorney, said he was happy with the agreement signed
Thursday.
   The Assuranceforening Skuld insurance company set the condition
that 90 percent of those eligible accept the offer by Sept. 1,
according to the Norwegian news agency NTB.
   The Aftenposten newspaper said the offer far exceeded
compensation paid after any such accident in Scandinavia.
   The Scandinavian Star burned April 7 on an overnight run from
Oslo to Copenhagen, Denmark. Police said the fire was arson, but no
arrests have been made.

is abolished.
   ``We strongly urge that there should be no relaxation of
existing measures,'' Mandela told the U.N. Committee Against
Apartheid. ``The sanctions that have been imposed by the United
Nations and by individual governments should remain in place.''
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress
leader, said the world should be aware there are white racists in
South Africa still bent on the ``physical liquidation'' of his
organization.
   ``We cannot afford to underestimate the threat that these
defenders of a brutal and continuing reality pose to the whole
process of working towards a just political settlement,'' said
Mandela, who was greeted at the U.N. with two standing ovations _
one on arrival and one before his speech.
   In Johannesburg, South Africa, police have arrested 11 whites in
connection with a right-wing plot to assassinate Mandela, President
F.W. de Klerk and other figures, a newspaper reported today.
   Authorities confirmed the arrests and said all were later
released. The Afrikaans-language weekly Vryeweekblad said that
under the plan, Mandela would have been shot at Johannesburg's Jan
Smuts Airport when he returned home July 18.
   Mandela's U.N. address was considered the most important
appearance of his U.S. tour, which began Wednesday.
   Earlier, Mandela displayed the same deft touch he's brought to
stadiums and street corners in addressing a group of the city's top
business leaders at the World Trade Center this morning.
   The African National Congress leader met with 150
representatives of Fortune 500 companies and other corporate
executives at the lower Manhattan skyscraper to assuage their
doubts about investments in his troubled homeland.
   ``He was bringing hope to these people about the future, and
they responded extremely well,'' said Port Authority Chairman
Richard Leone. ``There was a crackling excitement in the audience
... and you don't usually see that in an audience of this type.''
The Port Authority, a government agency that runs the trade center,
was a co-host of the closed meeting.
   Mandela, still basking from his packed receptions in Harlem and
Yankee Stadium a night earlier, told reporters after the meeting
that his New York welcome ``has been beyond my wildest dreams.''
   The outpouring of emotion and exuberance since his arrival here
on Wednesday will send him home ``strong and inspired,'' Mandela
said. Mayor David Dinkins flashed a thumbs-up sign when Mandela
made his comment.
   On Thursday, Mandela made exuberant and emotional appeals to a
packed house at Yankee Stadium and an estimated 100,000 people at a
rally in Harlem.
   Earlier, the 71-year-old freedom fighter and other participants
in an ecumenical service at Riverside Church danced jubilantly to
the beat of African drummers. The service, with 2,000 guests,
brought religious leaders of all faihs together in a call for
equality.
   Before leaving for the closed meeting with business leaders, he
started the day early with a walk to and through Carl Schurz Park,
not far from Gracie Mansion, where Mandela has been staying with
Dinkins.
   Mandela wore a blue business suit for the 6:35 a.m. jaunt;
Dinkins tagged along in a jogging suit. Mandela smiled and said
hello to joggers and bench-sitters.
   In his public addresses Thursday, Mandela urged a redoubling of
efforts to bring a speedy end to ``this shameful blot on humanity.''
   ``We are on the verge of victory, but the last mile of the
freedom road could prove to be the most difficult and the most
intractable,'' he warned.
   ``International pressure must be intensified and sanctions
maintained. Keep the pressure on apartheid,'' Mandela said,
reiterating the main theme of his 14-nation tour to raise money for
the black nationalist ANC.
   The crowds in Harlem began gathering hours before Mandela
arrived, an hour behind schedule. Many wore the red, black and
green colors of African liberation.
   Police estimated the crowd numbered 100,000.
   ``To our people, Harlem symbolizes strength,'' Mandela told the
crowd to a roar of applause.
   At the street rally and later at a sold-out Yankee Stadium, he
credited ``the unceasing solidarity of millions throughout the
world'' with helping to win his release from prison Feb. 11 after
27 years served for anti-apartheid activities.
   The 52,000 tickets to the stadium sold for $5 to $500;
organizers said they raised more than $250,000 for the ANC.
   While focusing his remarks on conditions in his homeland,
Mandela and his wife, Winnie, also noted the struggle against
racism that continues in this country.
   ``As we enter the last decade of the 20th century, it is
intolerable, unacceptable, that the cancer of racism is still
eating away at the fabric of societies in different parts of our
planet,'' he said.
   ``All of us, black and white, should spare no effort in our
struggle against all forms and manifestations of racism, wherever
and whenever it rears its ugly head.''
   Mandela's visit to the United States has tapped deep emotions in
black communities. In New York, where at least 1 million people
have come out to see him so far, a surge of pride has welled up in
poor neighborhoods.
   At a ``town meeting'' with Ted Koppel that aired Thursday night
on ABC, Mandela was asked why he supported Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, Cuban President Fidel Castro and Libyan strongman
Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``One of the mistakes the Western world makes is to think that
their enemies should be our enemies,'' he replied, to the
audience's loud approval. ``We have our own struggle.''
   He added that those leaders ``are placing resources at our
disposal to win the struggle.''
   Before the ecumenical service, Mandela met privately with 150
religious leaders and received a $200,000 check. Donations also
were made during the service and collected at the Harlem rally.
   The day's appearances ended on a lighter note at Yankee Stadium
when Dinkins presented Mandela a New York Yankees' warmup jacket
and cap.
   ``Now you know who I am,'' a beaming Mandela said. ``I am a
Yankee.''

   A fever that turns its victims black
has killed about 120 people and stricken another 15,000 in northern
Bangladesh over the past four months, officials and news reports
say.
   Kalazar, or black fever, is carried by sand flies, which inhabit
the river-crossed plains of northern Bangladesh.
   Health ministry officials said Friday they have reports of at
least 60 deaths from the disease in the northern districts of
Rangpur and Kurigram. United News of Bangladesh reported June 11
that black fever had killed 60 people and affected 15,000 others in
Bogra district, 100 miles north of Dhaka.
   Dr. Mahbubur Rahman, a radiologist at Dhaka Medical College,
said the disease, caused by a virus borne by the flies, first
causes a mild temperature and stomach pain. If untreated, it
attacks the liver, turning the victim black.

   The death toll from heavy flooding in the

Hunan official said Friday.
   The official from the Hunan Foreign Affairs office, contacted by
telephone, could offer no other information. The official press,
after initial reports earlier in the week, have largely ignored the
disaster.
   It was reported Sunday that more than 100 people had died from
heavy rains and floods that lashed the province between June 11 and
15. Reports said 16,000 homes were destroyed and vast areas of
farmland inundated.
   The Hunan floods are the first major disaster of the annual
summer flood and typhoon season in central and southern China. Last
summer nearly 3,000 people lost their lives, half in the populous
southwest province of Sichuan.

   ``Robin HUD,'' the former real estate agent who
claimed she stole from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to help the poor, was sentenced today to nearly four
years in prison and ordered to return $110,000 to the government.
   U.S. District Judge Herbert Murray followed the prosecution
recommendation to sentence Marilyn Harrell to 46 months. Federal
sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of 30 to 37 months, but
the judge agreed to a prosecution recommendation to increase the
sentence for aggravating factors. The total, however, is still less
than the maximum.
   Harrell's attorney, public defender Anthony Gallagher, had asked
for a sentence of 16 months, half to be served in a halfway house
or some other community based program.
   ``I have never said what I did was right,'' Harrell said in
court. ``In fact if a person steals five cents then they should be
done with whatever the court sees fit.''
   Harrell, 46, was nicknamed ``Robin HUD'' after claiming she
siphoned off millions from the sale of government-owned houses and
gave most of it to charity. She has acknowledged stealing $5.7
million and pleaded guilty in January to stealing government
property and filing a false tax return.
   Murray also sentenced Harrell to serve three years' probation,
624 hours of community service and $600,000 in restitution for the
embezzlement charge; she was ordered to serve one year in prison,
concurrently, on the tax charge.
   ``Some of those funds used admittedly were for good purposes,''
the judge said. ``But a substantial amount of the whole sum went to
you or members of your family.''
   Harrell told the judge that wasn't true, and Gallagher said
later that the sentence would be appealed.
   About $490,000 worth of property she owned has already been
forfeited to HUD. She now owes approximately $110,000.
   The two charges carry a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison
and $500,000 in fines.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has called the case the
largest theft of federal funds by an individual. Harrell became a
symbol of mismanagement at HUD during the Reagan administration,
when the scandal broke.
   Character witnesses testified today that Harrell gave them a
place to live and helped feed the poor.
   ``Marilyn saw that I'd have everything I that I needed,'' said
Carol Ann Swift, a double amputee who lived at a women's home that
Harrell supported with government funds. ``She gave me a home. She
went and got me clothes, furnished transportation and paid all my
doctor's bills and medication bills.''
   The Rev. Henry Studer, of Prince George's County, Md., testified
that Harrell gave $10,000 for the down payment on a building for
Maryland Rescue Ministry, and would ``sometimes take two and three
families at a time to Giant (supermarket) at $200 a pop.''
   Before sentencing the total amount of theft and the amount given
to charity had been disputed by both sides. The figures were not
resolved in court today.
   Prosecutors said in a pre-sentencing memorandum that Harrell
failed to turn in to HUD's Washington office about $6.6 million
from the sale of 99 properties between 1985 and 1988. Of that
amount, Harrell gave about $1.1 million to charity, prosecutors
said.
   Gallagher disputed those figures in a memo filed Wednesday,
claiming Harrell spent more than $5.1 million to help others and
kept only $243,000.
   As an escrow agent, Harrell collected money from the sales of
property purchased with HUD-guaranteed loans that had been
foreclosed on. Harrell said lax management allowed her to divert
the proceeds.

<HEAD>Army Sends Reinforcements To Stop Killings of Policemen in
Medellin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army is sending an anti-terrorism
unit to Medellin, center of Colombia's drug trade, to halt
assassinations of police by drug lords, the defense minister said
in statements published Friday.
   Police said four more policemen were murdered Thursday on the
streets of Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city. Their deaths
bring to 123 the number of Medellin law officers murdered this year.
   Also Thursday, police said they arrested a drug trafficking
suspect in Bogota wanted for trial in the United States.
   Julion Enrique Rojas, 49, has been accused by a Florida court of
cocaine distribution and illegal possession of arms, judicial
police spokeswoman Omayra Patino said by telephone.
   Defense Minister Oscar Botero said in a statement the army is
sending its Mobile Brigade to Medellin to reinforce the city's
4,000-member police force.
   In less than six months, authorities have been forced to send an
additional 1,300 troops to the city in the face of an unprecedented
campaign of bombings and assassinations by the powerful Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   Last week the army dispatched 350 more soldiers to Medellin from
the elite Rifle Battalion.
   In a statement sent to the Medellin daily newspaper El
Colombiano, Botero admitted that so far efforts to halt the
violence have been insufficient.
   ``Social solidarity and national unity are what is needed to
regain peace and harmony among Colombians,'' Botero wrote to the
publisher of El Colombiano, which has harshly criticized the
government's attempts to bring law and order to Medellin.
   Police Thursday began a new anti-drug crackdown in the city,
stepping up detentions, searches and street patrols.
   In a 24-hour period, security forces arrested at least 86 people
suspected of involvement in assassinations of policemen, the radio
networks RCN and Caracol reported Friday, citing police sources.
   A judicial police report said the Medellin cartel is offering
$4,300 to anyone who kills a policeman.
   Botero said that aside from troop reinforcements, authorities
are installing a new helicopter base in Medellin to be used in the
fight against the drug-related violence.
   The drug war began in August 1989 after drug lords assassinated
a presidential candidate. Since then, the government has extradited
14 drug suspects to the United States, killed Medellin cartel
leader Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and confiscated hundreds of
properties belonging to the cocaine magnates.
   They have responded with a bombing and terror campaign.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Up 3.9 Percent in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big-ticket'' durable goods jumped
3.9 percent in May, the government reported Friday. Analysts said
it was further evidence the economy's sluggish manufacturing sector
may be bouncing back.
   ``There have been some signs of a manufacturing rebound,'' said
economist Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa. ``Exports are healthy and inventories are rather low,
which bodes okay for a pickup in manufacturing and durable goods
over the next six months.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ items
such as automobiles and appliances expected to last at least three
years _ totaled a seasonally adjusted $128.2 billion after falling
4.2 percent in April.
   Orders have risen during three of the last four months after
plunging a record 10.5 percent in January.
   ``The 3.9 percent increase in durable goods orders almost offset
the 4.2 percent decline registered the previous month,'' said
Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   ``Taken in conjunction with the stronger 6.7 percent gain in
March, there are signs that industrial activity may be gradually
emerging from its slump,'' he added.
   Stephen S. Roach, senior economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, noted that much of the recent manufacturing weakness has
been in the automobile industry.
   ``With the auto sector moving back to more normal, the
manufacturing tone in terms of orders, unfilled orders and
industrial production is starting to look a little better,'' Roach
said. ``It could be an element of hope that has not been present
for over a year.''
   Most of the May increase was in transportation equipment, up 9.9
percent to $35.3 billion. Nearly two-thirds of this advance was
concentrated in automobiles; most of the remainder was in aircraft.
   Transportation orders have been volatile during much of the
year, including a 13.5 percent drop in April and a 24.1 percent
gain in March.
   Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.8 percent in May.
   But while analysts saw some reason for optimism in the overall
report, the closely watched non-defense capital goods sector, often
a barometer of business investment plans, fell 1.4 percent to $36.1
billion. It was the fourth decline this year after peaking in
December at $44.4 billion.
   Defense orders, another volatile category, jumped 19.0 percent
to $9.9 billion after a 3.4 percent gain in April. Excluding
defense, orders rose 2.8 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods, which have increased in three of the
last four months, were up 3.5 percent in May to $126.1 billion.
Unfilled orders edged up 0.4 percent to $500.3 billion, nearly half
of which is in aircraft.
   Both non-electrical machinery and primary metal orders were up
in May. Non-electrical machinery posted a 3.2 percent gain to $22.2
billion. Primary metals were up 2.2 percent to $11.8 billion, most
of which was in steel.
   Electrical machinery orders inched down 0.2 percent to $20.4
billion.

   Eric Levin hoped a catchy name for his
record store would bring in business, but he got more attention
than he wanted after opening Secret Service music &amp; more.
   The shop specializing in progressive and hard-to-find recordings
hadn't been open long when the 20-year-old owner got a visit from
two real Secret Service agents. They told him he was violating a
federal law by using the name of their employer.
   ``Their reasoning was that if someone knew of someone
threatening the life of the president and wanted to call the Secret
Service, they could get confused,'' Levin said Thursday.
   The agents, who showed up May 21, confiscated Levin's business
cards, several posters and several dozen T-shirts featuring the
store's logo.
   A shaken Levin, who had no idea he was breaking the law, agreed
to change the store's name.
   It's now Criminal Records.

<HEAD>Police Detain 11 in Alleged Plot to Kill de Klerk, Mandela</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mandela, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police detained 11 white men
in connection with an alleged plot by right-wing whites to kill
Nelson Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk. The men were released
Friday after questioning.
   A newspaper said the plan called for Mandela to be shot at
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport when he returns July 18 from his
six-week tour of North America, Africa and Europe. The
assassinations were intended to create chaos and cause a white
right-wing uprising to stop the government's racial reforms, the
Vrye Weekblad newspaper said.
   The South African Press Association quoted Mandela as saying in
New York he was too busy to worry about reports of the plot.
Mandela told reporters the African National Congress would be able
to function well without him if he were assassinated, SAPA said.
   Vrye Weekblad said the plot was exposed by Jannie Smith, a
former security policeman and National Intelligence Service agent,
after he infiltrated far-right groups. Smith went into hiding under
police guard Friday after giving police an affidavit, Vrye Weekblad
editor Max du Preez said.
   Working with newspaper staff, Smith taped conversations by
having himself wired and rooms bugged. Police have been given
copies of recordings containing information about the plot and a
detailed affidavit, the paper said.
   In his affidavit Smith said: ``I believe that various members of
the AWB (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) are very serious in putting
these plans into action. Urgent action against them is needed to
prevent a bloodbath.''
   The Afrikaner Resistance Movement is the best-known of South
Africa's right-wing white organizations and it was among those
Smith infiltrated.
   Kays Smit, chief secretary of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
said in a BBC Radio interview that several members of the
organization were among those detained Thursday. ``But seeing that
the (police) has released all of them, it was a frame-up by the
newspapers,'' Smit added.
   A spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Order, Capt. Peet
Bothma, said the 11 white men were released after questioning. He
said they had been held under a law that allows police to hold a
suspect for 48 hours for questioning.
   If the police believe there is a case to pursue, they will
present the information to the attorney-general, who may then
decide whether to prosecute, Bothma said.
   ``So far we don't have much, but there are certain leads that we
are following,'' Bothma said. He refused to disclose details from
the questioning or identify any of the men detained.
   The newspaper quoted Smith as saying South African Communist
Party leader Joe Slovo, Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok,
Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan were
also threatened by right-wing elements.
   De Klerk's government this year freed Mandela from prison after
he served 27 years of a life sentence for plotting against the
government. De Klerk has also scrapped some apartheid laws and
lifted the state of emergency in most of the country since he took
office in September.
   The changes have angered the country's right-wing whites, who
oppose sharing power with the black majority. Currently, blacks
have no representation in Parliament and are barred from voting in
national elections.
   The newspaper said a former Nazi captain, whom it identified as
Heinrich Beissner, was behind the plot to kill Mandela. It
identified Beissner as a regional head of the Afrikaner Resistance
Movement.
   Government-run television quoted Smit as acknowledging that
Beissner was a member of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement but
saying he would never have been placed in charge of any military
operation.
   The Afrikaner Resistance Movement also planned to blow up power
stations, kill members of Parliament and poison the water supply to
Soweto, a huge black residential area outside Johannesburg, the
newspaper said.
   An ANC spokesman, Ronnie Mamoepa said, ``This attempt to bring
about total anarchy must be harnessed before it is fully
unleashed.''
   The newspaper said Smith was told June 19 that he was to carry
out the Mandela assassination using a rifle with telescopic sights.
   Once Smith heard of the plot he informed the ANC, of which
Mandela is deputy president. ``They had planned it in detail, it
could have worked,'' de Preez said. ``They had a very special rifle
with very special bullets.''
   A council member on the right-wing Boksburg Town Council, T.J
Ferreira, was among those arrested Thursday night. Ferreira told an
independent radio station he was not involved in any plot.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Breast Cancer Drug for Treating Earlier Stage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Adminstration has approved the
drug tamoxifen for treating early breast cancer.
   The drug already was approved for advance cases.
   The action roughly doubles the number of patients covered by an
approved use of the drug, FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said Friday.
   Dr. Gerald Murphy, chief medical officer of the American Cancer
Society, said tamoxifen apparently was already in wide use for
treating early breast cancer.
   FDA approval ``just makes it more feasible for those physicians
and patients who decide that's necessary,'' he said. ``It's good
news.''
   Tamoxifen, taken twice daily by mouth, is used after breast
cancer surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. ICI
Pharmaceuticals Group of Wilmington, Del., sells it as Nolvadex.
   FDA had previously approved tamoxifen for women in whom cancer
cells had spread to the lymph nodes under the arm. Given that
approval, physicians could legally use tamoxifen for other patients
as well.
   The new approval, granted Thursday, covers women without any
spread to the lymph nodes. About half of breast cancer patients are
in that situation at diagnosis, the cancer institute says.
   Up to 30 percent or more of such ``node-negative'' women
ultimately have recurrences of cancer, the institute says.

   A Brazilian advertising executive
kidnapped two weeks ago was released unhurt after his family paid a
reported $2.5 million in ransom.
   Roberto Medina, head of the Artplan advertising agency, was
turned loose near downtown Rio late Thursday after the money was
dropped by the side of a highway, Rubem Medina, the victim's
brother, said in a televised interview.
   Television showed the haggard-looking executive arriving in a
police car at his home in the exclusive Nova Ipanema condominium in
Rio's Barra da Tijuca beach district.
   ``We have unofficial reports the kidnappers asked for $5 million
but then lowered the demand to $2.5 million,'' said Ricardo
Gouveia, a spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro state police.
   Police stayed out of the negotiations at the request of the
family, he said.
   Police chief Elson Campelo said Medina was grabbed by 10 men
carrying pistols and submachine guns as he left his office June 6.
   A week after the kidnapping, police arrested two men after
tracing a motorcycle abandoned near the ad agency. They are under
arrest and awaiting arraignment.
   Medina is one of 21 people, mostly businessmen, who were
kidnapped this year in Rio. Some $7.6 million in ransom has been
paid but police arrested suspects in only one previous case.

   A woman whose child died of meningitis
while a Christian Science practitioner was treating the girl with
prayer has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
   Laurie Walker, whose 4-year-old daughter, Shauntay, died in
1984, was placed on probation and sentenced to up to 600 hours of
community service Thursday by Superior Court Judge George
Nicholson. Walker had waived a jury trial.
   According to court records, Shauntay fell ill Feb. 21, 1984, and
her mother, following a basic premise of Christian Science that
disease can be healed through prayer alone, shunned medical
treatment and sought the services of an accredited Christian
Science practitioner.
   The practitioner, Norma Alpert, prayed for the child ``in
accordance with the tenets and practices'' of the religion, but the
child's breathing became labored and she died March 9, 1984,
according to court documents. No charges were filed against Alpert.
   Walker was then accused of involuntary manslaughter and child
endangerment, allegations that she has contested for six years.
   Nicholson's decision also contains protections for Walker's
older daughter, Tamu. Until Dec. 25, 1994, Tamu's 18th birthday,
the mother is obliged to let the daughter decide how she wishes to
be treated medically in the event of illness.
   Prosecutor John O'Mara said he agreed to the terms of the
settlement because the same result would have occurred had it gone
to trial. He also said nothing would be gained by jailing Walker,
who now lives in Boston.
   Similar cases have arisen around the nation, but the U.S.
Supreme Court typically has refused to hear such cases, and there
has been little consensus in state courts around the country.

   It may not have been the shortest
engagement on record, but it must be close: 75 minutes.
   Circuit Court Judge Muriel Robinson accepted the proposal from
Tandy Rice at 11 a.m. Thursday and the pair were wed in her
courthouse office in time for both to keep afternoon appointments.
   The judge, 46, and Rice, 52, a booking agent for country
entertainers, had been dating for eight months, but hadn't
discussed marriage.
   Ms. Robinson said Rice, who once booked appearances for
presidential brother Billy Carter, called her at 11 a.m. and asked
how soon she could get a marriage license.
   ``When I said it wouldn't take long, he said, `Will you marry
me?''' she recalled.
   ``I said `Yes. When would you like to do this?' He said,
`12:15,' because he had a meeting at 1.''
   She took off her red judicial robe and held a bouquet of white
roses during the ceremony, performed by Circuit Judge Tom Brothers.
It was the third marriage for both.
   After the ceremony, the bride went to the monthly luncheon
meeting of Davidson County trial judges and the groom headed for
his 1 p.m. appointment.
   ``I thought I knew what I was going to do today,'' the judge
said, ``but the day definitely took a turn for the better.''

may sing the praises of being ``on the road again,'' but his son
won't be driving for a year.
   Willie Nelson Jr., 32, pleaded guilty Thursday before Probate
Court Judge James R. Everett to two counts of driving under the
influence.
   As punishment, the younger Nelson will have to spend 20 days in
jail, pay a $1,000 fine, give up driving for a year and perform 160
hours of community service.
   Two other DUI charges and one count of driving without a license
were dismissed.
   Among the elder Nelson's hits is ``On the Road Again.''

   Kentucky basketball coach Rick Pitino
needs just one more son now for a full team after his wife gave
birth to another boy.
   Pitino's wife, Joanne, gave birth to 6-pound, 9-ounce Ryan
Martin Pitino at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York early
Thursday.
   A spokesman in Kentucky's basketball office said Joanne Pitino
had the baby at Northern Westchester because her doctor is there
and because she had experienced difficulty with a previous birth.
   Pitino had placed a jet on standby and wanted to be with his
wife when she had the baby, said university officials. But he
didn't get there in time.
   ``She went into false labor Tuesday, and he left Lexington
Tuesday afternoon for New York, and Rick came back to Lexington
yesterday, and she had it last night,'' Kentucky sports information
director Chris Cameron said.
   ``I talked to him this morning and he seemed happy and a little
frustrated he wasn't there,'' Cameron said Thursday afternoon.
   Pitino's other sons are ages 13, 9 and 6. Another son, Daniel,
was 6 months old when he died after undergoing kidney surgery.
   Pitino, 37, was head coach of the Nantional Basketball
Association's New York Knicks for two years before he accepted the
coaching job at Kentucky last year. He also was head coach at
Providence from 1985 to 1987.

   Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent will conduct a
hearing July 5 to review New York Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner's dealings with a man accused of extortion.
   That same day, Howard Spira, 31, of New York, is to be arraigned
on the charges before a U.S. magistrate.
   The commissioner's hearing is based on a report from Washington
lawyer John Dowd _ prepared at Vincent's request _ which examines
the circumstances surrounding a $40,000 payment from Steinbrenner
to Spira in January.
   Spira was indicted in Tampa, Fla., on March 23, but the case was
moved here after his attorney, David Greenfield, complained that
Steinbrenner would have an unfair advantage in Florida.
   Steinbrenner lives in Tampa and his shipbuilding business is
headquartered there.
   Spira was to have been arraigned Thursday, but a delay was
sought because an assistant U.S. attorney from Tampa could not be
present. The arraigment was then rescheduled for July 5.
   Greenfield said Spira would plead innocent to the charges and
that the case would go to trial, perhaps later this year or early
next year.
   At first, Steinbrenner said he paid Spira $40,000 ``out of the
goodness of my heart.'' Later, he claimed he gave Spira the money
to stop him from disclosing embarrassing information about former
Yankees employees.
   Spira said he was paid to collect damaging information on
outfielder Dave Winfield, who had a feud with Steinbrenner.

   Gary Hart is helping launch an international
business firm that he hopes will be able to mine the riches in
Eastern European countries emerging from communist control.
   Hart and Denver businessman David Miller are partners in
International Strategies, an affiliate of the Denver law firm of
Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs, to which Hart has belonged for several
years.
   ``The Soviet Union is loaded with American business people
offering everything from T-shirts to 707s and many of them are
rather starry-eyed,'' Hart said.
   ``There's a good deal of naivete about how fast things will move
in the Soviet Union,'' he added. ``There are big projects and big
deals to be done, and some small ones. But they won't be done at
the same degree of acceleration.''
   Hart, a former U.S. senator from Colorado, was the front-runner
for the Democratic nomination for president in 1987 when he was
forced to withdraw from the race because of an alleged liaison with
model Donna Rice. He has practiced law in Denver since then.

   The director of the Jamison Project dance
company says she's looking forward sharing the ``celebration of
life through movement'' when the company merges with the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater.
   The Jamison Project, a repertory company directed by acclaimed
dancer and choreographer Judith Jamison, had one of its final
performances Thursday in the auditorium of the Afro-American
Historical and Cultural Museum.
   The Jamison Project will spend its last 10 days as an
independent company in Philadelphia before joining the Ailey group
in New York.
   Jamison will serve as artistic director. Two dancers in the
Jamison Project will join Ailey's 26-member company; the 10 others
will pursue careers elsewhere.
   Jamison assumed the duties of artistic director in January, one
month after Ailey's death. For the past six months, she has
directed both companies.
   ``Alvin Ailey allowed us to enjoy his God-given talents on stage
and off,'' Jamison said. ``The Jamison Project became part of that
growing tree of individuality and uniqueness _ to share in that
celebration of life through movement.''
   The Jamison Project was founded by Jamison in 1988 to showcase
choreography. It is a result of a collaboration between Jamison,
Jacob's Pillow, which is the nation's oldest dance festival, and
the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, the company's home base.

<TEXT>
   To Hobie Cawood, the proposed monument to
the Constitution is a thing of beauty and grace, symbolism and
significance. To Edmund Bacon, it looks like ``Bugs Bunny ears.''
   The First Amendment right of free speech was exercised fully
Thursday when Independence National Historical Park held an open
house to display models and drawings of the monument.
   Detractors said the limited competition that led to the design
was inadequate for a national monument; some bemoaned the loss of
the fountain now on the Independence Mall site, across the street
from the Liberty Bell pavilion.
   If built according to current plan, the $5 million monument
would consist of two 19-foot-high walls, running parallel and
pointing at the bell and Independence Hall. At the base, a shallow
fountain would rush over a mosaic of stone.
   Bacon, a former city planning commission director and one of
those responsible for the park and mall, maintained a steady stream
of criticism and passed out typed lists of his complaints at the
open house.
   ``What's going on here is supposed to be the monument to the
Constitution, which in a certain sense transcends even the
Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln memorials because it is not to an
individual, it is to a great concept,'' he said. ``I think it looks
dinky; I think it looks like Bugs Bunny ears.
   ``Somebody else said it looks like the security things you pass
through when you go into an airport. And other people think it
looks like billboards.
   ``And it is so clear that in that huge space it will look
absolutely ridiculous, and it will make the city of Philadelphia
and the nation look silly.''
   Replied Cawood, superintendent of the park: ``What is Ed Bacon's
monstrosity is somebody else's work of art.''
   Under the plan, the walls would have the Constitution,
amendments and all, etched in bronze. On the outside, the walls
would be faced with stone slabs from all 50 states.
   ``It's a sincere attempt to make something appropriate,
something that is a thing of beauty,'' said designer Bruce
Thompson, who had to pretend not to hear such comments as, ``I
don't like this at all.''
   The plan would require the demolition of the circular fountain,
which has been dry since 1987. Cawood said it is beyond repair,
dangerous and too expensive to operate.
   Opponents argue the fountain could be fixed for half the
expected $5 million cost of the new monument.
   Citizens were encouraged to write down their comments and leave
them in a box.
   Besides the differing opinions, money is a problem. Though
Congress passed a bill in 1988 authorizing the building of a
monument, it's up to Cawood to find the money from private and
public sources.
   ``As Benjamin Franklin said, nothing in life is certain except
death and taxes,'' Cawood said.

<HEAD>Doctor to Parents: Tell Kids Ninja Turtles Just a Movie</HEAD>

   Children entralled with the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles should be reminded that the swashbuckling
exploits of the movie aren't meant to be played out in the streets,
safety experts said Friday.
   At the Northampton studios where the popular characters were
created, a few calls have been received, mainly dealing with
children who apparently went looking for their heroes in real-life
drainage systems, said Cheryl Prindle, executive director of Mirage
Studios.
   Since the sewer-dwelling comic-book heroes made a smash screen
debut in April, there have been a few reports of injuries.
Officials said they don't see any widespread problem, but they do
recommend using some parental common sense.
   ``There are isolated things here and isolated things there,''
said Bob O'Brien, director of public relations for the
Chicago-based National Safety Council.
   The comic-book characters, a quartet of green, hip creatures who
got their super crime-fighting powers after falling into a puddle
of radioactive goo in a New York City sewer, use martial arts
techniques learned from the mutant pet rat of a Ninja master.
   ``Basically, our feeling is that kids need to be able to discern
what is real and what isn't,'' Prindle said.
   ``Definitely, the Ninja Turtles don't encourage the kids to go
in the sewers looking for them,'' she said. ``I do definitely agree
with the National Safety Council that children need supervision,
whether it be from the home or the school or wherever it is they're
playing.''
   In Worcester, the director of the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center pediatric trauma care said he has seen about a
half-dozen young patients since April who said they were playing at
being turtles.
   ``The kids are very impressionable and the turtles have never
looked so cool as they do in the movies so I think they're bound to
be imitated,'' said Dr. Michael P. Hirsh.
   Elsewhere, two young boys in the Dayton, Ohio, area had to be
pulled from a pond by adults after they followed a sewer culvert to
its end. The mother of one of the boys said the children were
pretending to be Ninja turtles. Also in April, a Lombard, Ill., boy
dropped a manhole cover on his foot, authorities said.
   The turtles have been around since 1984, when Northampton
friends Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird scraped up the funds for the
first printing of their characters. From there the characters _
Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello and Leonardo _ got their own
television show. Their film debut was the biggest spring opening in
Hollywood history.

   Two hospital pharmacy workers were fired
Friday after the deaths of three premature infants that had
received an incorrectly mixed intravenous solution, hospital
officials said.
   ``The infants were given an IV solution, incorrectly prepared in
the pharmacy, that contained potassium,'' said Martin Goldsmith,
president of Albert Einstein Medical Center. ``The potassium caused
a drop in heart rate in the three babies. Despite aggressive
resuscitation efforts, the infants died.''
   An internal investigation into the deaths of two girls and a boy
in the neonatal intensive care unit June 15-16 revealed that
pharmacy workers incorrectly prepared a solution used to flush an
IV tube after medication is given, the hospital said.
   ``The IV solution should have contained heparin, dextrose and
water,'' Goldsmith said. ``Instead, it contained heparin and
potassium.''
   Three employees were initially suspended but one was cleared
Friday by the hospital investigation. The two others, a pharmacist
and a pharmacy technician, were fired, the hospital said. The
employees' names were not released.
   Goldsmith said the infants were very ill. All were born 13 to 15
weeks premature and weighed less than 2{ pounds at the time of
death, the hospital said.
   All three deaths were ruled accidental by the medical examiner,
said spokesman Bill Gilbert. Immediate cause of death for all three
was hyperkalemia, or abnormally high potassium levels in the blood,
he said.
   The medical examiner's office identified the victims, all of
Philadelphia, as Latoya Simmons, 1 month old; George Rodriguez, 3
months; and Rayna Williams, 15 days old. Prematurity was listed as
a contributing factor in the deaths.
   Goldsmith said the hospital reviewed safety procedures and is
strictly monitoring compliance. He ordered mandatory in-service
training for all pharmacy workers and will bring in outside experts
to review safety procedures.
   ``We are certain this was an isolated occurrence due to human
error, and we want to make sure we're doing everything possible to
prevent future accidents,'' Goldsmith said.
   Goldsmith said hospital officials felt ``remorse'' about the
deaths.
   ``We are distraught that we had a mistake made in our
pharmacy,'' he said.

   The Interior Department, citing evidence the
northern spotted owl may become extinct, ordered the reclusive bird
protected Friday as a threatened species, putting thousands of
logging jobs into jeopardy.
   The decision was expected to dramatically curtail logging across
millions of acres of virgin forests in the Pacific Northwest, where
intense clearing of ancient trees over decades has destroyed the
owl's habitat and put its survival into question.
   But the government said the region's jobs complicated the issue
and postponed an announcement of a specific owl recovery plan on
what logging restrictions will be required to protect the brown
bird. An announcement on the forest management plan was expected
next week.
   ``The biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is
in trouble,'' said John Turner, director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, who made the decision to declare the owl threatened under
the Endangered Species Act.
   ``We will not, and by law cannot, ignore that evidence.''
   Industry and government estimates said as many as 28,000 timber
industry jobs could be lost in the next decade and entire logging
communities disrupted by restrictions to protect the owl.
   Environmentalists who have fought to protect the owl say those
estimates are exaggerated.
   ``Our intention now is to find ways to protect the owl with the
least possible disruption to the timber economy in the Pacific
Northwest,'' said Turner. He said he is convinced ``there is room
to protect both the owl and loggers.''
   The estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of remaining northern spotted
owls are scattered in old-growth forest in Washington, Oregon and
northern California _ an area that also accounts for by far the
largest supply of lumber in this country.
   Turner said ``compelling evidence shows that the spotted owl is
at risk'' of extinction if current logging practices continue and
more forest is destroyed in the three states.
   Although the decision to protect the owl is expected to have
widespread impact on logging, Turner said he does not foresee
significant disruption of this summer's harvesting of Northwest
timber.
   ``Planned logging is going to go on and with very little
disruption,'' said Turner. Timber cutting under current contracts
with the government would proceed, he said. The effective date of
Turner's listing of the owl as threatened goes into effect July 23.
   About 90 percent of the remaining spotted owls live in forests
owned by the federal government and managed by either the U.S.
Forest Service or Interior's Bureau of Land Management.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter are to announce next Tuesday a plan aimed at
protecting the owl on the government lands and at the same time
``reduce the disruption'' to logging communities. ``Our plan will
be to achieve a balance,'' said Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein.
   The management plan, which is envisioned to include curbs on
logging, must be approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service to
assure it provides protection to the bird. Private landowners
seeking to cut in areas where the owl lives will also have to take
steps to limit the impact on owl habitat, officials said.
   Designation of a species as threatened makes it illegal to harm
any of the owls or destroy their critical habitat without federal
government approval. A threatened species is one that is likely to
become endangered in the foreseeable future. It is afforded similar
protections as species classified as endangered.
   The protection applies to owl on both private and government
land. Under some circumstances private land owners may petition to
cut in areas occupied by the owl. Federal agencies may not allow
cutting on federal lands unless a tree harvesting plan has been
approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The decision to protect the owl represents a reversal by the
Fish and Wildlife Service which for many years refused to list the
bird and had to be forced by a federal court in 1988 to reconsider
the status of the owl.

   The general manager of the Metropolitan Opera
resigned Friday, less than eight months after he took over the
position with the nation's largest opera company.
   Hugh Southern, 58, surprised the opera community with his
resignation, effective July 1.
   ``I have been reluctant to make such a choice, but I have become
aware over the course of the season that I had not found
fulfillment in the position of general manager of the
Metropolitan,'' Southern said in a statement.
   ``I, therefore, felt it would not be fair or productive either
to myself or to the Met to continue, and have tendered my
resignation.''
   David Reuben, a spokesman for the Met, said, ``Nobody is going
to make any further comment. The statement speaks for itself.''
   On Nov. 1, Southern replaced Bruce Crawford, who decided to
return to the corporate world. Both had been seen as general
managers who would cope with financial matters while artistic
director James Levine was in charge of aesthetic decisions.
   Southern, a native of England, went to the Met from the National
Endowment for the Arts, where he had been deputy chairman for 12
major arts disciplines programs and, for a few months last year,
acting chairman. Before that, he had been executive director for
New York's Theater Development Fund for 14 years.

<HEAD>Economic Merger Sealed As Allies Meet To Discuss Unification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two Germanys, for 40 years the
most visible symbol of the Cold War divide, on Friday took their
biggest step toward unification by reaching final agreement on
economic merger.
   In East Berlin, representatives of the World War II victors and
vanquished gathered to discuss German unity, and one of the most
notorious markers of East-West conflict _ Checkpoint Charlie _ was
removed from the Berlin Wall.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in Berlin for the
unity talks, said a united Germany could join NATO after a
five-year transition period and the pullout of foreign troops from
the country. Secretary of State James A. Baker III rejected the
proposal, saying it was a decision for the Germans to make after
unification.
   Nonetheless, Shevardnadze said later he hoped agreement on
unification could be reached ``by the end of the year.''
   Despite international differences over unification, the German
states continued the race to merge.
   Government officials in Bonn, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said an all-German election was most likely Dec. 9.
   They said Chancellor Helmut Kohl preferred that date because it
would allow a new parliament to convene in early January. An
earlier date would have required the new parliament to meet between
Christmas and New Year, the sources said.
   Wighard Haerdtl, an official in West Germany's Interior
Ministry, said Friday negotiations were under way between East and
West Germany for a second treaty outlining the consitutional
aspects of German unification. He said it should be ready for
signing in September.
   The only real remaining obstacle to unification is the military
stance of a united Germany. The United States and Western Allies
want the new country to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; the Soviet Union has refused to accept this.
   Baker rejected Shevardnadze's conditional acceptance plan
Friday, saying the issue should be decided by a sovereign Germany.
   With little fanfare, the upper house of the West German
parliament on Friday approved the treaty that will merge the
economies of the German states on July 2.
   On that day, the powerful West German Deutsche mark takes over,
East Germany's 40 years of rigid socialism gives way to capitalism
and the borders that once separated families and worlds will fall.
   On Thursday, lawmakers in the East German parliament and the
powerful lower house of the West German parliament overwhelmingly
approved the economic treaty and sealed their decision with joyous
applause.
   Both countries also pledged to respect Poland's Western border
and not make any territorial claims after unification on German
territory lost after World War II. The issue had become one of the
most sensitive in the unification realm; about a third of
present-day Poland is former German territory.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel appeared before the
Bundesrat, or upper house, Friday to argue for passage of the
economic treaty.
   The West German opposition Social Democrats had long criticized
the swift pace of unification and complained the treaty on
monetary, economic and social union didn't contain enough
safeguards for East Germans as they move from a socialist economy
to a free market.
   Nontheless, passage had been virtually assured. Social
Democratic chairman Hans Jochen-Vogel had said Thursday they
wouldn't torpedo the treaty because East German expectations were
too high and ``uncontrollable'' events could result from a no-vote.
   In Friday's debate, Lothar Spaeth, governor of the
Baden-Wuerttemberg state and a member of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, called it a ``most ridiculous argument'' that economic
unification move more slowly.
   ``The people over there have set the pace,'' he said, noting the
hundreds of thousands of East Germans who fled their repressive
communist country last year after borders were open to the West.
   Kohl was meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand on
the Rhine when the economic treaty gained final approval, and there
was no immediate reaction from the man who aspires to be the first
chancellor of a unified Germany.
   In a plea Thursday for approval of the pact, he said ``the hopes
of the people of Germany for the unity and freedom of all Germans
are about to be fulfilite the rush to unification, there are many fears
about next
month's economic merger.
   Some experts have predicted up to 2 million East Germans will
lose their jobs as outmoded government-owned factories and
businesseled.''
   Desps try to compete in the free-market system. More than a
third of the enterprises are expected to close, and social unrest
could result.
   West Germans worry how much unification could cost them, either
in possibly higher taxes or inflation.
   However, the West German government has said it won't raise
taxes, and in May unveiled a nearly $70 billion German Unity Fund
to be used to rebuild East Germany.

<HEAD>Joint Chiefs Chairman: Don't Break Military With Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top military officer jumped into
the Pentagon budget battle Friday, arguing that hasty cuts in
military spending will end up ``breaking the back'' of America's
defense.
   ``If you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a
so-called peace dividend, you will get neither,'' Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech to
the National Press Club.
   ``As we get smaller, we also need to get better. If we do it too
fast, we don't get better _ we get hollow,'' he said, warning
against a return to the post-Vietnam War and World War II
reductions.
   Powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the
debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of
lessened East-West tensions.
   A former national security adviser, Powell now serves as the
president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the
nations' military leaders.
   Powell said that even though the Berlin Wall has fallen and the
Warsaw Pact has nearly evaporated, he has had to place the American
military in dangerous situations during his brief stint in office.
   ``I have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman
that this is still a dangerous world and that you'd better be able
to respond if someone challenges your interests,'' he said, citing
Panama, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, Europe and Korea as
examples.
   Powell said that despite changes in the Soviet Union, the
Soviets still have the ability to destroy the United States with
nuclear weapons.
   ``We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a
decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the
enduring realities we face,'' Powell said.
   The four-star general said that although Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains ``very much in charge,'' his policies
``are sowing the seed of his own weakness.''
   The Soviet Union will remain a superpower well into the next
century, Powell said. ``So even as we reduce, we must maintain our
ability to deter and defend,'' he said.
   Powell said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan released
earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five
years shows ``we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal.''
   But the general also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as ``a realistic, prudent response''
to the changing world.
   The administration budget blueprint, Powell said, will begin to
reduce the nation's forces over time. ``On this glide path we will
reach a base force which I believe is not prudent to go below if we
wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities,''
Powell said.
   ``We know we will get smaller. That is inevitable, that is the
correct thing to do,`' Powell said. But if Bush's budget request is
cut back significantly, ``You will force us to start breaking the
back of our armed forces,'' he said.
   The general also took aim at lawmakers who are seeking more
severe cuts over a shorter period of time. Although he named no
names, House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., has been
sharply critical of Cheney's 25 percent plan, and Senate Armed
Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has complained about strategic
``blanks'' in Cheney's budget.
   ``We are looking ahead with our eyes open. We're cutting
programs. We want to close bases. We've frozen construction and
hiring. We're cutting troops, and believe it or not _ we're cutting
generals,'' Powell said.
   ``What we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins,
what we need is breathing space. We need to time to make the plans
work,'' Powell said.

<HEAD>Russian Communists Lean Toward Conservative for Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hard-line critic of Mikhail S. Gorbachev gained
the most votes Friday in the election for a new Communist Party
chief in the Russian Federation and was favored to win the post in
a runoff.
   A victory by Ivan Polozkov could turn the Communist Party in the
Russian Federation _ the Soviet Union's largest republic _ into a
power base for conservatives. It could also cause a split in the
national Communist Party.
   The new leader was expected to be named Saturday.
   Polozkov received the most votes among seven nominees Friday,
with 1,017 to 848 for moderate Oleg Lobov. Soviet journalists
predicted Polozkov would win enough of the total 2,633 votes from
the defeated conservatives to triumph in the runoff.
   Technically, all Communists are automatically considered members
of both the national and republic parties. But a delegate from the
Volga River city of Kuibyshev said the election of the conservative
Polozkov as head of the Russian party could cause half the
Communists in his area to quit.
   The national Communist Party congress meets in nine days to
revamp its program and leadership, and many expect it to split.
   Just three weeks ago, radical reformer Boris Yeltsin was elected
president of Russia. That gave Gorbachev a strong rival on the
other side.
   It is not known if Gorbachev and his centrists would side with
conservatives, with reformers, or head out on their own.
   But this week's Russian party congress made a Gorbachev alliance
with hard-liners seem unlikely. They repeatedly attacked the Soviet
president's reforms and applauded speakers calling for Gorbachev's
replacement as head of the national party.
   Leaving the party job legally would not affect Gorbachev's
position as president of the Soviet Union.
   The Russian Communist Party was re-established this week for the
first time since 1925. At that time, it was absorbed into the
national party partly for fear its leaders could become competitors
in the struggle for power. Russia contains half the Soviet people,
more than half of its Communists and three-quarters of its land.
   Despite Polozkov's harsh criticism of reform, Gorbachev backed
him three weeks ago for president of the Russian republic against
populist reformer Boris Yeltsin. In his campaign speech on
Thursday, Polozkov moderated his most extreme views.
   Adding to the confusion, Gorbachev was beaming Friday, laughing
and joking at the Russian party congress, where he has been under
severe attack by hard-liners all week.
   Reformist Vyacheslav Bragin, a Communist Party chief from
Kalinin, told the congress before the vote, ``If we elect Polozkov,
it will mean the sunset of the party.''
   Many delegates reacted to Bragin's speech, which also criticized
the military, with derisive whistles. Gorbachev, who presided over
the proceedings, quieted the delegates down but also rebuked Bragin
for fostering confrontation.
   Lobov, 53, an ethnic Russian construction engineer and a member
of the national parliament, supports Gorbachev's proposed party
platform and favors transferring power from the party to the
government.
   In his campaign speech, he said his bywords include ``Don't
panic'' and ``There are no unsolvable problems.''
   The government daily Izvestia said he believes the party should
have a dialogue with its opponents and cooperation with local
governing bodies.
   Polozkov, 55-year-old party chief in the southern Russian region
of Krasnodar, has called for strict party discipline and has
complained that older party members are not respected.
   He also has condemned informal political groups and has become
famous for warring against the small private businesses legalized
by Gorbachev.
   On Wednesday, he rejected reformers' calls for the party to
apologize for decades of dictatorship.
   The 2,700 Communists of the Russian congress will be the
majority of the 4,700 delegates at next month's national party
congress. Reformers have complained they were bypassed in the
selection of delegates.

   Radios rang with the African National Congress
anthem Friday as Boston prepared for to celebrate Nelson Mandela's
one-day visit.
   Green and gold billboards welcomed Mandela and his wife, Winnie,
to a city that is often gripped by racial strife but is home to
some of the South African freedom fighters' staunchest American
supporters.
   The black, green and gold African National Congress Flag flew at
City Hall Plaza. Last week, a city councilman objected to the flag,
but his objections were brushed aside by Mayor Raymond Flynn's
administration.
   Church bells were scheduled to ring at 11 a.m. Saturday as part
of the noisy welcome organized by the Rev. Vernon Carter, a
Lutheran pastor and longtime community activist.
   Mandela's schedule includes a visit to a Boston high school, a
motorcade, a rally and free concert, a luncheon with the Kennedy
family and a reception with prominent business leaders.
   The 71-year-old deputy head of the African National Congress,
recently freed after 27 years in prison, is on a grueling six-week
tour of 13 countries. He is working to raise money and keep
international pressure on South Africa's government to end its
policy of racial separation.
   Along Mandela's motorcade route through the predominantly black
Roxbury section, there were few signs Friday that residents knew
the anti-apartheid leader would drive through their neighborhood.
   A lone T-shirt salesman staked out one intersection. Carefully
hung Winnie Mandela shirts provided shade for a fruit vendor's
stall nearby.
   Connie Johnson, who is helping coordinate Mandela's visit, said
the route of Mandela's motorcade hadn't been publicized for
security reasons.
   Just a couple blocks off the route, residents of the Mandela
housing development spoke Friday of their disappointment they won't
be getting a visit. The motorcade won't pass the building as the
tenants had wished, but the Mandela complex is visible to Mandela
from his route.
   ``We want him to stop and wave at us,'' said Amy Port, who like
many tenants is a native of Africa. Port is from Liberia.
   The privately owned, 22-building complex houses 1,500 blacks and
Hispanics. It was officially named for the South African activist
by the tenants in 1987, and Mandela is spelled out in large white
letters on one of the buildings.
   ``Nelson Mandela would be proud of it,'' said Barbara Jones, the
property manager.
   Organizers say up to 500,000 people may attend a star-studded
free concert in Mandela's honor on the bank of the Charles River.
   The performers include Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, Livingston
Taylor, Bobby McFerrin, and the South African group Ladysmith Black
Mambazo. Actor Danny Glover and comedian-activist Dick Gregory were
scheduled to attend.

   A controversial study by AIDS activists of
a Chinese herbal treatment has produced promising early signs of
stopping the AIDS virus's lethal destruction of blood cells, its
organizer said Friday.
   The treatment, called compound Q, is being tested by a community
group outside the usual control of medical schools and hospitals
that ordinarily evaluate new medicines.
   ``At this stage, we have seen a major and dramatic change in
what happens to these patients,'' said Martin Delaney.
   Delaney, director of San Francisco's Project Inform, said his
group wanted to speed up the time-consuming process of figuring out
whether potential AIDS drugs work.
   However, some experts said the group's data is of limited value
in assessing compound Q, and one prominent physician called Delaney
irresponsible for releasing his conclusion without providing data
to back it up.
   Delaney described his group's work at the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS.
   Compound Q, a protein derived from an herbal plant root, is also
being tested by researchers at the University of California, San
Francisco. But doctors there said it's too soon to say whether the
treatment is worthwhile.
   Dr. James Kahn, who is conducting that study, said Delaney's
work ``doesn't invite scientific scrutiny, but it helps us focus on
what's important.''
   Kahn also cautioned that compound Q can have toxic, even fatal,
side effects. ``This is a very dangerous drug,'' he said.
   In their experiment, Project Inform has tested compound Q on 46
patients for 116 days. Before the treatment, their helper T cells _
the primary target of the AIDS virus _ had been steadily declining.
But after treatment, the loss stopped or even reversed itself in 38
of them.
   Delaney cautioned that his work does not prove that compound Q
will be an effective AIDS drug, but he said, ``We don't see
anything like this with AZT,'' the only AIDS drug now approved for
routine use.
   He did not reveal basic information about the study, such as
other drugs the patients were taking, how sick they were or how
they were recruited.
   ``You are irresponsible in making such statements without
providing your data,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New
England Journal of Medicine. ``We don't know if this is just
another flash in the pan or something great.''
   Dr. Dan Hoth, director of the Division on AIDS at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he did not
consider Delaney to be irresponsible. But he said he worried about
what sick people would make of his conclusions.
   ``I fear that patients, because they are so desperate, will
grasp at this,'' he said. ``We simply don't know. We haven't
reviewed it.''
   Joel Thomas, a patient taking compound Q, said he thought the
medicine had made a dramatic difference for him.
   ``It has literally turned my health around,'' Thomas said.
``There is a clear regression of the disease.''
   Compound Q appears to work by attacking infected macrophages.
These blood cells, which eat germs and debris in the bloodstream,
become virus-making factories when they are invaded by HIV, the
AIDs virus.

   Israel will not wait for U.S. help in arranging
peace talks but will try on its own to find Palestinians willing to
negotiate without the blessing of the PLO, officials said Friday.
   All such efforts have failed in the past, and prominent
Palestinians say the new quest is doomed without the approval of
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top policy adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said Israel was not dependent on the United States to
arrange a dialogue with Palestinians.
   ``We do not need to wait for mediation. We will try to reach out
to Palestinians,'' he said in an interview. ``We will not rely on
one channel to try to do things that can be done by Israel.''
   The effort by Israel's new right-wing Cabinet comes after the
last government collapsed when its liberal and conservative members
split over accepting U.S. proposals for opening Israeli-Palestinian
talks in Cairo, Egypt.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III wanted to include
Palestinians that have been deported by Israel as a compromise to
PLO demands that Palestinians not living in the occupied lands be
included in the delegation. But Shamir said this amounted to
indirect PLO control.
   Ben Aharon disputed Baker's statement Thursday that any dialogue
needs ``PLO acquiesence.''
   ``We are going to make a determined effort to convince our
Palestinians here that the PLO option is not available,'' he said.
``We have been seeking peace for 42 years, and no one has come
forward. It's a long haul, but there is no alternative.''
   Palestinian sources said Defense Minister Moshe Arens has
already sought to arrange meetings with influential Palestinians to
explore the prospects for a formal dialogue. But most efforts to
even talk about talks have failed.
   Arens spokesman Dan Naveh said the goal of such talks was making
progress toward Israel's proposal for elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He refused to say whether Arens had succeeded in arranging any
meetings, but denied Palestinian claims that he was refused by
Hilmi Hanoun, mayor of the West Bank town of Tulkarem.
   Mansur al-Shawwa, a Gaza businessman, said he met with Brig.
Gen. Arieh Ramot, head of the army-run government in Gaza.
   ``He told me that Israel is working towards building up a new
generation of Palestinians who are willing to talk with Israel
without any OK from the PLO,'' he said.
   Al-Shawwa said he might agree to meet Shamir or Arens but did
not believe Israel would find much support among Gaza's 750,000
Palestinians.
   Palestinians have resisted more than 20 years of efforts by
Israel to create an alternative leadership to the PLO.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began 30 months ago, Palestinians
who cooperate with Israel have come under attack. Some 225
Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians, most on
suspicion of being informers.
   Ben Aharon said it may be impossible to find Palestinian
partners unless the United States completely severs its dialogue
with the PLO.
   President Bush on Wednesday suspended the 18-month-old dialogue
when the group failed to condemn an aborted terrorist attack on
Israel May 30. Abu Abbas, a member of the PLO executive committee
and a leader of a PLO faction, claimed responsibility.
   Ben-Aharon said that by suspending the talks instead severing
them, ``The United States has not shut the door. It has just shut
the window.''

<TEXT>
   Sir Tom Hopkinson, a pioneer in photojournalism
who used stark, unadorned pictures to raise awareness of society's
ills, has died, his family said Friday. He was 85.
   Hopkinson died Wednesday at Oxford, where he lived. No cause of
death was given.
   Hopkinson was editor of the now defunct magazine Picture Post
from 1940 to 1950 and was also editor of the South African magazine
Drum from 1958 to 1961.
   After earning his master's degree at Oxford University, he
worked in advertising and as a free-lance journalist. He became
involved in the art of photojournalism in 1934 as assistant editor
of the magazine Weekly Illustrated.
   Picture Post was launched in 1938 by publisher Edward Hulton,
with Stefan Lorant as editor and Hopkinson as his assistant.
Hopkinson took over as editor when Lorant emigrated to the United
States in 1940.
   Hopkinson specialized in bold, observant photographs and
coverage of news and social issues in Britain and abroad that
depicted people's lives without gloss or gimmickry.
   ``We (on Pictire Post) were out to influence events in a
particular direction _ that of a more just and equal society,''
Hopkinson said once in an interview.
   Picture Post photographs such as one by Bert Hardy of slum kids
in the Scottish city in Glasgow in 1948 became classics of
photojournalism.
   Hopkinson quit the magazine in 1950, along with reporter James
Cameron, when Hulton stopped publication of a story Cameron brought
back from the Korean war about mistreatment of political prisoners
by South Korea.
   In his time at Picture Post, Hopkinson schooled a generation of
young photographers and writers to link pictures and words to
increase the impact of a story. The magazine folded in 1957.
   After leaving the magazine, Hopkinson wrote several books. From
1954 to 1956 he was features editor of the now defunct London
newspaper the News Chronicle and also worked as a journalistic
adviser to Independent Television's current affairs program ``This
Week.''
   In 1958, he accepted an invitation by Jim Bailey, the owner of
Drum, to go to Johannesburg as editor of the magazine, which was
aimed at black readers.
   He recalled his experiences with the magazine and his travels in
Africa in his 1962 book ``In the Fiery Continent.''
   He later moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where from 1963 to 1966 he was
regional director of the International Press Institute and headed
an IPI center to train black journalists.
   In 1967 he became a lecturer in journalism at the University of
Sussex in southern England. He was a visiting professor in
journalism at the University of Minnesota from 1968 to 1969.
   In 1970 he became director of the Center for Journalism Studies
at University College in Cardiff in Wales. He was knighted by Queen
Elizabeth II for his services to journalism in 1978.
   He is survived by his wife and three daughters.

<TEXT>
   Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, the first
black elected governor, campaigned Friday in the state that breeds
presidential dreams but insisted he was here to stump for Iowa
Democrats.
   Wilder was appearing around the state Friday and Saturday to
campaign for Don Avenson, the Democrat seeking to unseat Republican
Gov. Terry Branstad, and other candidates.
   He conceded one goal of his tour would be ``to speak about what
I think is taking place around the country in terms of people
recognizing the need to have voices articulating what the new
mainstream is.''
   The ``new mainstream'' is a key Wilder theme, one that enabled
him to win election in a southern state that is just 19 percent
black. Many Democrats view Wilder as a less threatening national
candidate than the more charismatic, and radical, Jesse Jackson.
   As to who belongs to the new mainstream, ``There are any number
of those persons around and I'd like to think I'm one of those
persons,'' Wilder said.
   Wilder insisted he would serve out the four-year term as
Virginia governor to which he was elected in November.
   ``I've only been elected for six months and I don't think I've
established a sufficient enough record of accountability as a chief
executive ... to talk about trying to lead a nation,'' said Wilder.
   Nevertheless, he said, it isn't too early for others to talk
about the 1992 campaign. Wilder had harsh criticism for some
leading Democratic contenders who seem to be keeping a low profile
in light of President Bush's high approval ratings.
   ``I think it's bad, I think it's a mistake to believe that you
can sit out for four years and come back and be a leader four years
later,'' said Wilder. ``For instance, in 1992 you say `we'll just
sit back and wait because who wants to run against an incumbent,
it's difficult it's hard. In 1996, I'll be your leader.'
   ``The people need leadership now,'' said Wilder. ``This is one
of the reasons I'm hoping we can frame the issues, force the
dialogue.''
   Asked how reporters should judge his visit to the state whose
caucuses kick off the presidential season, Wilder said: ``I guess
I'm a politician, I guess you'll have to judge me that way. Trust
me, I'm here for the purposes of electing a good man governor.''

   Japan surpassed the United States to become the
world's largest donor of foreign aid in 1989, providing nearly $9
billion in official development assistance, the foreign ministry
said Friday.
   The $8.96 billion that Japan supplied to poor nations was down
1.9 percent from the previous year in dollar terms, but still put
Japan in the No. 1 position, the ministry said.
   In yen terms, Japan's contributions to developing countries
increased by 5.6 percent, according to Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development statistics cited by the ministry.
   Among the key donor nations in the 24-member OECD, however,
Japan ranked 12th in the percentage of its gross national product
spent on development aid at 0.32 percent, identical to the previous
year. Norway and Denmark were in first and second place at 1.02 and
1 percent respectively, the OECD said.
   The United States, previously the top donor, provided $7.66
billion in foreign aid in 1989, or 0.15 percent of its GNP, the
OECD said.
   France was next at $7.47 billion, followed by West Germany with
$4.95 billion and Italy with $3.33 billion, it said.
   Foreign Ministry officials said Japan would continue to boost
its aid budget in yen terms, but that a five-year aid plan calling
for more than $50 billion in assistance in 1988-92 might be hard to
fulfill because of exchange rate fluctuations, the Kyodo News
Service reported.

   The Bush administration brushed aside Nelson
Mandela's support for anti-American leaders and said Friday that
his meetings here next week will focus on negotiations to end
apartheid in South Africa.
   President Bush and other administration officials will ask
Mandela on Monday about his ``road map for negotiations'' with the
white minority government, Assistant Secretary of State Herman
Cohen told reporters.
   Cohen, who heads the department's Africa affairs bureau, said he
believes agreement will be reached soon on releasing South African
political prisoners and that the administration wants to know
Mandela's view on subsequent steps in the democratization process.
   ``What happens after that?'' he asked. ``Who sits at table? What
would be the format? What are his (Mandela's) constitutional
ambitions? What are his economic models?''
   Cohen spoke as the African National Congress leader wound up a
tumultuous three-day visit to New York and prepared to head for
Boston.
   Cohen said he disagreed with the statements of support Mandela
has made for Cuban President Fidel Castro, Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
   All have been accused by the United States of engaging in
terrorist activities, but Mandela said the three support ``our
struggle to the hilt.'' He declined to criticize their human-rights
record.
   ``We feel that one cannot fail to take into account the human
rights records in their own countries,'' Cohen said. ``Just to feel
that these are good people because they are helping your cause we
think is an insufficient response to human rights violations.''
   Mandela's observations on Gadhafi, Castro and Arafat won't be a
central element in Monday's talks, Cohen said.
   Mandela has said repeatedly the United States must retain the
sanctions it has imposed against South Africa. To do otherwise
would ease the pressure on the South African government to
dismantle apartheid, he has said.
   Cohen said the sanctions will remain in place because South
Africa has not met the congressionally mandated requirements for
lifting them.
   He said he does not see sanctions as an important issue during
the 2{ hours Mandela will spend with Bush and a subsequent meeting
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Sanctions, Cohen said, ``are not a key element of the talks.''
The administration, he said, hopes to get clues from Mandela on how
it can best support negotiations on ending apartheid.

<HEAD>EC Official Says Summit's `Main Test' Will be on East-West
Relations</HEAD>

   West European leaders will be put to
the test at an upcoming summit to see if they can fall behind a
common approach to East-West relations, a top official of the
European Community said Friday.
   ``It is very important that the European Community should have
an overall vision of the way in which it wants Europe to develop,''
said Jacques Delors, president of the trading bloc's executive
agency.
   He told reporters the 12-nation community must show that it can
be as ``firm, dynamic and convincing in this area'' as it is in
economic and monetary fields.
   The ``main test'' of the summit, opening Monday in Dublin,
Ireland, will be the leaders' ability to come up with a similar
analysis of the changes under way on their continent and how to
deal with them, he said.
   The test, he said, is ``to see whether (the officials are) able
to respond to the challenges of a new international situation.''
   The community should unite behind common positions in
preparation for a 35-nation summit in Paris in December, he said.
The gathering will be held as part of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, a forum used in the past for discussing
human rights issues.
   Without a united approach, Delors said he was concerned that
``the sirens (at the summit) may pull them one way or another,'' a
reference to a variety of proposals being offered for reshaping
Europe.
   He also said the leaders would discuss at the Dublin meeting
whether they should put together an aid package to help Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rescue his failing economic reform
program.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand have urged their colleagues to discuss the issue at the
summit.
   Delors declined to elaborate on possible options for the
Kremlin. He said the executive body, the European Commission, was
``waiting to see how and on what terms (the leaders) wish to tackle
this matter.''
   ``We will be ready,'' he said. ``We have our ideas on this.''
   The commission was put in charge last summer of an effort by two
dozen Western countries to help Poland and Hungary. The program
will be expanded next month to include some other emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe.
   Some officials believe it is unlikely that the Soviet Union
would be brought into that program because of the country's
enormous size and extent of its economic woes.

   An in-law of ousted Panamanian leader Manuel
Noriega was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his involvement in
a drug smuggling ring.
   Domingo Negrette, whose wife is Noriega's cousin, also was
placed on probation for 15 years and fined $250,000 in Thursday's
sentencing.
   Negrette, 26, of Miami was convicted May 30 of cocaine
trafficking and grand theft. He was among 37 people charged in
connection with what law enforcement officials called ``Operation
Corinthian,'' so named for the Colombian nickname for high-grade
marijuana.
   The investigation was set up to bust a large Colombian drug
operation headed by Carlos Escobar, of Colombia who remains at
large, prosecutors said.
   Undercover deputies posing as drug dealers befriended Escobar
and convinced him they could provide discreet locations in rural
areas of Polk County to store drugs for distribution.
   Negrette's defense was that he was entrapped, coerced into the
drug deal by an informant working for the state.

<HEAD>GOP Aims to Burn Democrats Over Flag Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans on Friday tried to inflict
political pain on Democrats whose votes defeated President Bush's
constitutional amendment against flag desecration.
   ``The House, the so-called people's body, has said `no' to the
millions of concerned Americans who believe that Old Glory deserves
one type of protection only _ and that's cultural protection,''
said Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate Minority Leader.
   ``These guys are tone deaf to cultural anger,'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Republican Whip.
   The House on Thursday voted 254-177 for the amendment, 34 votes
short of the two-thirds required to send the proposed change in the
Constitution to the states.
   Democrats who led the opposition glowed in their victory over
what they termed as an assault on the Bill of Rights. Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., even suggested that Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., and others join the ``honor roll'' beside
``Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. ''
   ``What we defeated was a rather homely form of politics that
will sacrifice anything, even our hallowed Constitution, to air an
ad, defeat a candidate or grasp for power,'' he said.
   Within minutes after Thursday's vote, GOP campaign operatives
sent out press releases attacking Democrats who voted against the
amendment.
   Gingrich told reporters Friday that the Democrats ``have totally
misunderstood America'' and Republicans would make that point in
this fall's elections.
   Foley's leadership on the flag issue ``was an extraordinary
mistake, politically,'' he said.
   Gingrich said he and House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.,
were meeting with veterans groups to enlist their help in defeating
Democrats who voted against the amendment.
   ``You're going to see a systematic effort to use it, and I think
it's going to be effective in some places,'' he said, especially
when combined with other issues Republicans contend show a
lawmaker's ``values.''
   ``It's not a killer issue. By itself, it's not going to beat
anybody. But for somebody whose values are in question anyway,'' he
said, it could make the difference.
   Although the House action killed the amendment's chances for
this year, the Senate is expected to start debate on Monday and is
looking to vote Tuesday night.
   The GOP hopes to take over the Senate this fall from the
Democrats, who now hold a 55-45 majority, and could make the `no'
votes of liberal Democrats a factor in the races.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who has said he would oppose the flag
amendment and who faces a challenge from Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa,
on Friday introduced a bill to foster public education about the
flag.
   But Dole said the choice would be very simple.
   ``We can either follow the House's lead and embrace the Beltway
`know-it-alls' or we can embrace the will of the American people,''
Dole said.

<HEAD>Maker of `Read My Lips' Game Donates Money for Federal Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gesture is unlikely to make a dent in the
federal deficit, but the maker of a new board game called ``Read My
Lips'' thought it might be able to sell a few more games if it
offered to contribute.
   Pressman Toy Corp. of New York has pledged to donate $1 from the
sale of each $17 game to the federal government to help reduce the
nation's deficit.
   The board game, whose title was the campaign rallying cry for
President Bush in his pledge not to raise taxes, involves one
partner trying to guess the words being mouthed by another.
   To promote its move, the company sent copies of the game to Bush
and reporters in Washington.
   Buyers have to send the company their sales receipts and a game
scorecard to put the donation into effect, said Pressman spokesman
Mark Kulkis.
   The promotion is good from June 25 through July 4, to give the
gimmick an Independence Day angle.
   The money that is collected will go to the Bureau of the Public
Debt in Washington, the agency that accepts donations to reduce the
$152 billion deficit, said Kulkis.
   He said the company asked whether Bush would agree to be
photographed receiving a check for the amount raised, and perhaps
play a couple rounds of the game.
   But it's unlikely that Bush will ever see the game sent to him,
or receive the check in person.
   The company received a reply from Joe Hagin, a deputy assistant
to the president, instructing that the game be sent to the White
House ``gift room'', the cemetery for unsolicited gifts that come
to the president from the public, said Kulkis.

<HEAD>Airline Delays Unimproved Despite Reporting Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The percentage of delayed passenger flights
has not improved since 1987 when airlines first were required to
disclose their performance, a congressional study said Friday.
   The study by the General Accounting Office criticizes the
government reporting system for failing to show how late flights
are and said some flights are not accurately reported by the
airlines.
   Since September 1987, on-time performance logged by the
Transportation Department's monthly reports has ranged from a low
of 66 percent in December 1987 to a high of 86 percent in September
1988. The data is based on reports airlines are required to file
with the government.
   In 1988, 20 percent of all flights were late; last year, late
flights increased to 24 percent, the GAO said.
   Airline industry and government officials agree that most flight
delays are due to poor weather and that airport congestion is a
growing factor. Delays generally are greater in winter months.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on Thursday said that if
something is not done about airport capacity, the number of
airports experiencing 20,000 annual hours of delay will increase
from 21 now to 39 by 1997.
   A flight is considered on time if it departs or arrives within
15 minutes of its scheduled time.
   Delays due to mechanical problems are not counted, and the GAO
said the department does little to verify information about the
23,000 such flights each month. That's about 5 percent of scheduled
flights.
   The GAO study said that the department's inspector general found
last year that a tracing of sample flights of 12 major airlines
showed that of 3,903 flights excluded from delay statistics because
of mechanical problems, 564 should have been reported.
   The study also said about 4,700 flights a month are cancelled
for non-mechnical reasons but are reported simply as late flights
and put in the same category as those running more than 15 minutes
behind.
   Some of the non-mechanical cancellations, the GAO said, are
caused when a flight is cancelled for mechanical problems and other
flights schedules are adjusted to accommodate the most passengers
possible.
   The GAO recommended changes in the reporting system to include
the reasons for non-mechanical delays.

   The Interior Department, citing evidence the
northern spotted owl may become extinct, ordered the reclusive bird
protected Friday as a threatened species, putting thousands of
logging jobs into jeopardy.
   The decision was expected to dramatically curtail logging across
millions of acres of virgin forests in the Pacific Northwest, where
intense clearing of ancient trees over decades has destroyed the
owl's habitat and put its survival into question.
   But the government said the region's jobs complicated the issue
and postponed an announcement of a specific owl recovery plan on
what logging restrictions will be required to protect the brown
bird. An announcement on the forest management plan was expected
next week.
   ``The biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is
in trouble,'' said John Turner, director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, who made the decision to declare the owl threatened under
the Endangered Species Act.
   ``We will not, and by law cannot, ignore that evidence.''
   Industry and government estimates said as many as 28,000 timber
industry jobs could be lost in the next decade and entire logging
communities disrupted by restrictions to protect the owl.
   Environmentalists who have fought to protect the owl say those
estimates are exaggerated.
   ``Our intention now is to find ways to protect the owl with the
least possible disruption to the timber economy in the Pacific
Northwest,'' said Turner. He said he is convinced ``there is room
to protect both the owl and loggers.''
   The estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of remaining northern spotted
owls are scattered in old-growth forest in Washington, Oregon and
northern California _ an area that also accounts for by far the
largest supply of lumber in this country.
   The decision brought mixed response from Congress.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the designation ``recognizes the
mistakes of the past which allowed massive clear-cutting of our
last remaining ancient forests.''
   But congressmen from the Northwest states urged that loggers and
the local communities not be forgotten in developing an owl
recovery plan.
   ``We have to protect the environment and maintain the livelihood
of our people. ... Finding the balance will be difficult,'' said
Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., adding that ``every man, woman and
child (in his state) is going to be affected'' by the decision.
   Some environmentalists, meanwhile, cautioned that the future of
the bird may depend on how aggressively the Bush administration
seeks to curtail timber cutting in owl recovery plan.
   ``Our concern is ... if they do not put appropriate restrictions
on timber harvesting today's listing decision will be gutted and it
will be meaningless,'' said Frances Hunt of the National Wildlife
Federation.
   Turner said ``compelling evidence shows that the spotted owl is
at risk'' of extinction if current logging practices continue and
more forest is destroyed in the three states.
   Although the decision to protect the owl is expected to have
widespread impact on logging, Turner said he does not foresee
significant disruption of this summer's harvesting of Northwest
timber.
   ``Planned logging is going to go on and with very little
disruption,'' said Turner. Timber cutting under current contracts
with the government would proceed, he said. The effective date of
Turner's listing of the owl as threatened goes into effect July 23.
   About 90 percent of the remaining spotted owls live in forests
owned by the federal government and managed by either the U.S.
Forest Service or Interior's Bureau of Land Management.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter are to announce next Tuesday a plan aimed at
protecting the owl on the government lands and at the same time
``reduce the disruption'' to logging communities. ``Our plan will
be to achieve a balance,'' said Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein.
   The management plan, which is envisioned to include curbs on
logging, must be approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service to
assure it provides protection to the bird. Private landowners
seeking to cut in areas where the owl lives will also have to take
steps to limit the impact on owl habitat, officials said.
   Designation of a species as threatened makes it illegal to harm
any of the owls or destroy their critical habitat without federal
government approval. A threatened species is one that is likely to
become endangered in the foreseeable future. It is afforded similar
protections as species classified as endangered.
   The protection applies to owl on both private and government
land. Under some circumstances private land owners may petition to
cut in areas occupied by the owl. Federal agencies may not allow
cutting on federal lands unless a tree harvesting plan has been
approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The decision to protect the owl represents a reversal by the
Fish and Wildlife Service which for many years refused to list the
bird and had to be forced by a federal court in 1988 to reconsider
the status of the owl.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young soldier was convicted of
killing a Liberian civilian and sentenced to death Friday, and an
Israeli-trained presidential guard was ordered jailed for 10 years
for shooting an American.
   They were the first government troops sentenced in a wave of
violence against civilians that began after rebels invaded Liberia
in late December. Many slayings have been tribal reprisals against
people accused of supporting the rebels trying to oust President
Samuel Doe.
   Pvt. James M. Grear, 24, hung his head but showed no other
emotion when he received the death sentence from a court-martial
sitting at the Barclay Training Center, Monrovia's main army
barracks. He is scheduled to be executed by firing squad early
Saturday.
   Court president, Col. Isaac Nyeplu, presiding over a three-man
board, read charges that Grear shot and killed Edward Welmongah on
April 7 after an argument outside an oceanside nightclub near
downtown.
   Grear admitted killing Welmongah ``because the deceased made him
vexed,'' Nyeplu said.
   Pvt. Alphonso G. Kahn, the second soldier, was found guilty of
manslaughter in the death of Joseph Martin Millay, an American
aircraft mechanic in his 20s. Millay died of a heart attack on the
operating table nearly two days after being shot in the leg on
April 4 by Kahn.
   Kahn, 25, belongs to the Israeli-trained Special Anti-Terrorist
Unit of the presidential guard.
   The court is set to convene again Monday to hear the case of
three other soldiers accused of butchering three civilians,
including sculpture R. Vanjah Richards. The public has not been
allowed into the trial since opening day.
   The insurgency, led by Charles Taylor, has escalated into a
tribal conflict since the rebels invaded from neighboring Ivory
Coast six months ago.
   Most rebels are from the Gio and Mano tribes, while government
supporters are mostly Krahns and Mandingos. Doe himself is a Krahn.
   The rebels, who have been advanced for weeks toward the capital,
are now fighting around Careysburg, 15 miles from Monrovia.
Panicked Monrovians have been fleeing the capital by the thousands.
   Rebels accuse Doe of corruption and rights abuses. Doe took
power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the descendents of
American slaves who founded the West African nation in 1847. The
American descendents historically monopolized power and
discriminated against indigenous Liberians.
   In Brussels Friday, the European Community's executive
commission announced it has sent more than $2 million in medical
aid to Liberian refugees.

<TEXT>
   A student who addressed a Beijing University
rally marking the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators has been expelled, a school official
said Friday.
   An official of the Students Office said Li Minqi, a 21-year-old
economics major, had been expelled from school days earlier.
   Li was the only student to deliver a speech during a spontaneous
campus rally by hundreds of students on the night of June 3 to
protest the brutal military suppression of the student-led
pro-democracy movement a year earlier.
   The school official, who declined to give her name, could not
confirm reports from Hong Kong that Li had been detained by police
and charged with making anti-government speeches.
   An official at the Public Security Bureau said he did not know
whether Li had been arrested.
   In his speech to the rally, Li denounced government corruption
and exploitation of workers and called on Communist authorities to
return factories to the workers and treat intellectuals with more
respect.
   Large police and military forces had been deployed around the
city to prevent any commemorations of the anniversary, and the
Beijing University rally was the only group protest to be held.
Party officials at the campus said the students had been influenced
by ``foreign and domestic reactionaries.''
   Li fled the campus on June 4, but sources at the university said
he returned June 5 and was attending classes while waiting for
university authorities to decide his fate.
   Tiananmen Square in central Beijing was the focal point of last
year's pro-democracy demonstrations. Troops occupied the square on
the night of June 3-4, and hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of
people were killed in the ensuing violence.

<TEXT>
   J.M. Schneider Inc. of Ontario, Canada, is
voluntarily recalling 20,000 pounds of frankfurters distributed to
retail grocery stores in the Northeast because the meat may be
contaminated, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Officials said the recalled franks are suspected of being
contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause
listeriosis, a potentially serious disease.
   The product, labeled ``Schneider's Franks,'' is sold in
one-pound plastic packages. The words ``Canada 35'' appear inside
the inspection seal on the label. All bearing the ``Best before''
date of ``Jul 03'' are being recalled.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, we urge consumers to
return the suspect franks to the place of purchase,'' said Ronald
J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service.
   None of the company's other products is involved in the recall.
   The problem with the franks was discovered May 31 during a
routine USDA import re-inspection in Buffalo, N.Y. Laboratory tests
confirmed the bacterial contamination on June 20, said agency
spokesman Jim Greene.
   ``In general, healthy people are believed to be at little risk
from listeriosis,'' the announcement said. ``Most vulnerable are
those with weakened immune systems _ infants, the elderly and the
chronically ill. Listeriosis in pregnant women can cause
miscarriage.''
   Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms
such as fever, chills, headache, backache and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea, it said. In newborns, symptoms include
respiratory distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.
   Consumers with questions about the recall may phone the
toll-free USDA hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
EDT, Monday through Friday. At other times a recording will provide
information.
   Washington, D.C., area consumers can call 447-3333.

girl, and a French envoy continued trying to mediate an end to the
4{-month-old conflict.
   Police said three other women, including the dead girl's sister,
were wounded in pre-dawn fighting between troops of rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun and militiamen led by Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
before it died down.
   The sisters were hit when a mortar round, fired by Aoun's
gunners, landed on their house in East Beirut's Sin el-Fil
district, controlled by the Lebanese Forces.
   By police count, 1,044 people have been killed and 2,789 wounded
since the Aoun-Geagea power struggle for control of the small
Christian enclave broke out Jan. 30.
   The fighting has forced more than 400,000 of the enclave's 1
million inhabitants to flee to safer areas or leave the country.
   French envoy Francois Scheer on Friday crossed from west Beirut,
where he met with government leaders, into the Christian sector of
the divided Lebanese capital to meet with Aoun.
   Scheer briefed Aoun on the reactions of Syrian and Lebanese
leaders to France's six-day effort to implement an Arab
League-brokered peace pact to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war
between Christians and Moslems.
   He later returned to west Beirut to catch a plane bound for
Paris.
   Shortly before his departure Scheer said he conveyed to
President Elias Hrawi's government proposals from Aoun. He refused
to disclose further details.
   Scheer, director-general of France's Foreign Ministry, arrived
in Beirut late Monday. The Christian rivals have been fighting
continually since then despite a nominal, month-old cease-fire.
   Scheer held a series of meetings with Lebanese leaders then made
an overnight visit to Damascus Wednesday to meet Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.The French envoy returned to Beirut
Thursday for further talks with Lebanese leaders.
   The peace accord was endorsed by the Lebanese Parliament last
October.
   Syrian-backed Lebanese President Elias Hrawi was elected Nov. 24
to implement the accord, which shares power equally between the
long-dominant Christians, and Moslems _ now 55 percent of the 4
million population.
   Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi and rejects the peace accord
because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian
troops, in Lebanon since 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   The general's actions have blocked Hrawi's efforts to extend his
authority to the Christian enclave and put constitutional reforms
into effect.
   Geagea, whose militia is the largest Christian private army in
Lebanon, has recognized Hrawi and termed the peace accord ``a
gateway'' to national reconciliation.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of the treaty that prepares the economic
merger of the two Germanys in July, and the separate resolution
recognizing Poland's borders.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OVERVIEW _ The two Germanys agreed to create a monetary,
economic and social union as a first step to unification under the
West German constitution. The international implications of the
merger must be resolved in talks among the four victorious World
War II powers _ the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and
France.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MONETARY UNION _ On July 1, the West German mark becomes the
legal tender in East Germany, but because that day is a Sunday,
actual implementation will be July 2. The West German Bundesbank,
or central bank, will have control over monetary policy in both
countries. The economic union will be based on a free-market
economy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONVERSION RATES _ Workers will have their wages converted from
East German marks to West German marks at a 1-1 rate.
   For savings deposits, East Germans 14 and younger will be able
to convert up to $1,200 at a 1-1 rate. Those aged 15-59 will be
able to convert $2,400 at the 1-1 rate. People 60 and older can
covert up $3,600 at the favorable rate. All other savings will be
converted at two East marks for one West mark.
   East German pensions will be brought to West German levels,
raising most of them.
   Debts will be converted at a 2-1 rate, more favorable to
troubled East German companies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BORDER RESOLUTION _ In a separate resolution, the parliaments of
East and West Germany recognized Poland's Western border,
delineated by the Oder-Neisse rivers. The resolution said ``both
sides declare that they will not raise territorial claims now or in
the future.''
   The resolution was necessary to generate international support
or the rapidly approaching unification. About one-third of present
day Poland is former German territory lost after World War II.
Poles feared a united Germany might try to reclaim the land, a wish
of many ultraconservative German voters who considered it rightful
German property.

   An attorney for the city government testified
in Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial Friday that he found the
mayor slumped one night in a bathroom littered with drug
paraphernalia.
   ``The smoke and the ... smell ... got stronger as the evening
went on,'' said James McWilliams, recalling a December 1988 night
he spent with Barry and key prosecution witness Charles Lewis at a
Washington hotel room.
   McWilliams, who is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading
guilty to drug-related charges, backed up testimony from Lewis
about the evening of alleged crack cocaine use by the three-term
mayor.
   McWilliams said he went to Lewis' room that night to discuss a
job transfer with the mayor. But the bearded McWilliams said that
as he pressed his case, Barry just told him at one point, ``you
know, you look a lot like Santa Claus.''
   A legal counsel for the city's Department of Public Works,
McWilliams testified he helped Lewis and Barry hide the alleged
drug use from police investigators ``because I was protecting
Marion Barry.''
   Barry, 54, is facing three felony charges of perjury, 10
misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count
of conspiracy to possess cocaine. He has pleaded innocent.
   Lewis, a convicted drug dealer, testified earlier this week that
he used drugs with Barry repeatedly between 1986 and 1988 and
smoked crack cocaine with him on four occasions in Lewis'
Washington room, including Dec. 19, 1988.
   McWilliams said he went to Lewis' room that night to talk
discuss a job transfer with the mayor. But Lewis first asked
McWilliams for $40 to ``got out and get some stuff,'' McWilliams
testified,
   ``I understood he was going to go out and get some drugs'' with
the money, said McWilliams. Lewis came back with a plastic bag
``that had a white substance inside,'' he said.
   Barry, who he said arrived later, then went repeatedly with
Lewis into the bathroom and kitchen. Smoke and ``a strong unusual
smell'' from the bathroom grew as McWilliams watched Monday Night
Football, McWilliams testified.
   ``What did they say when they came back'' from the bathroom?
asked assistant U.S. attorney Richard Roberts.
   That ``this is good stuff ... I will go back and have another
hit,'' replied McWilliams, quoting Barry and Lewis.
   McWilliams, a former assistant attorney general in the Virgin
Islands, said he tried to talk to Barry about the job transfer, but
``I didn't think I was getting through.''
   In the bathroom, an arms-length from the mayor, a vanity was
littered with matches, white residue in a plastic bag and a
tin-foil-covered glass, testified McWilliams.
   The mayor ``appeared restful, peaceful,'' McWilliams said. ``He
was sitting on the commode and he was just slumped over a little
bit. I kept making my pitch about the job.
   ``He looked up and said, `you know, you look a lot like Santa
Claus,''' testified McWilliams, whose beard is heavily streaked
with gray.
   McWilliams never said, however, that he saw Barry using drugs.
McWilliams said he didn't use drugs himself.
   McWilliams also backed up parts of Lewis' testimony that Lewis
and the mayor conspired to hide their alleged acts as a police
investigation closed in on Lewis, saying he acted as a go-between
for Lewis and Barry.
   McWilliams said he lied to police when detectives interviewed
him about his visit to Lewis' room.
   ``I didn't tell the truth because I was protecting Marion
Barry,'' he said. Barry was ``someone who I respected'' and the
mayor's ``services to the city and civil rights were something I
considered important,'' he testified.
   Testifying after McWilliams, a long-time friend of Lewis' said
he hosted Lewis over the Christmas weekend in the days just after
Barry and Lewis found out about the police investigation.
   John W. Olsen testified that Lewis called the mayor Dec. 23 and
assured him, ``I've got things under control, I will take care of
business.''
   McWilliams pleaded guilty in January to aiding and abetting
Lewis' possession of cocaine.

<HEAD>Romania, and Weeping Iliescu, Marks Six Months Since Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GABRIEL PASLARU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after the violent
revolution that overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, his
successor stood and wept Friday by the graves of those killed in
the fighting.
   Official observances and prayer services marked the half-year
anniversary of the revolution. But among many Romanians there was a
sense of uncertainty about the future following last week's
crackdown on anti-government demonstrators in which six people died
and hundreds were injured.
   Ion Iliescu, sworn in as president on Wednesday, and Premier
Petre Roman laid wreaths at the Young Heroes' Cemetery, where
students and other young people killed in battles with Ceausescu's
security forces are buried.
   According to the official death toll, at least 1,033 people were
killed in the December revolt.
   At the cemetery in southwest Bucharest, the crowd observed a
minute of silence as Iliescu wept by the graves. Earlier, he
exchanged brief remarks with mourning relatives.
   Iliescu and Radu Campeanu, leader of the opposition National
Liberal Party, were among those attending a memorial service at
Bucharest's Patriarhie Cathedral.
   Patriarch Teoctist, spiritual leader of the Romanian Orthodox
Church, told the worshipers that remembering the heroes of the
revolution provides ``a moment of reflection over our consciousness
and life.''
   Despite better-stocked food stores and an influx of imported
Sony TV sets and JVC video recorders for the first time, some
people felt the revolution's aims were unfulfilled.
   ``At least if we knew why these people had to die. We do not
really enjoy peace,'' said Iuliana Vasiliu, who mourned at the
grave of her son, Florentin, 37.
   Bucharest residents joined the revolution on Dec. 21. Ceausescu
was ousted on Dec. 22 and executed three days later together with
his wife, Elena.
   ``I do not think George would have been happy to see the latest
developments,'' said Iolanda Radulescu about her brother, who was
killed in December and buried in the Young Heroes' Cemetery.
   ``He did not die just to see us hate and beat each other,'' she
said, referring to the riots that started June 13 when police broke
up a 53-day anti-government demonstration in Bucharest's main
square.
   The demonstrators had been demanding the ouster of Iliescu,
accusing him and other government officials of being
neo-Communists. Iliescu was a former Communist Party secretary who
fell into disfavor with Ceausescu.
   After angry crowds attacked official buildings, Iliescu appealed
to workers to help defend the government. Thousands of loyalist
miners heeded the appeal, attacking political foes, students and
bystanders throughout Bucharest.
   In addition to the six dead, more than 500 were injured. The
government said more than 1,000 people were detained, including
student leaders, most of whom have been released.
   In another development Friday, Ceausescu's sister, Maria Agache,
went on trial under charges of fraud involving public property and
abuse of privilege.
   A brief report by the state Rompres news agency did not provide
further details, but knowledgeable Romanians said Ms. Agache had
amassed a fortune by buying and selling property illegally.
   Her trial started a day after the Supreme Court sentenced
Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, a general and one of Ceausescu's five
brothers, to 15 years in prison for inciting mass murder and
attempted aggravated murder during the revolution. He had said he
was innocent of charges that he shot at demonstrators in Bucharest
on Dec. 21.

<HEAD>Summer Showers Sweep Over Much of the Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Summer showers and thunderstorms swept through New England and
much of the South and the nation's midsection Friday, ripping down
power lines and tossing trees.
   The showers and thunderstorms reached across northern and
central New England early Friday afternoon. The storms also rumbled
through parts of North and South Dakota and across Minnesota, Iowa,
Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, New York,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, North and South Carolina and
Georgia.
   At least one tornado was reported as swift-moving thunderstorms
whipped through central and eastern North Carolina, knocking out
power to 25,000 Wake County residents and causing three fires,
officials said.
   The storm dumped torrents of rain and stirred up winds that
reached 48 mph at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. But
within a half-hour of the storm's arrival, it had moved on.
   The wind gusts over North Carolina damaged trees and power lines
in northeast Johnston County and Person County, as well as at Wake
Forest, south of Oxford and near Jackson. Trees were toppled onto
most major highways in central Iredell County.
   Thunderstorms and wind also ripped down several trees near
Hickory Tavern, S.C.
   Temperatures across Georgia cooled as a series of thunderstorms
moved across the state, but the rain was spotty. Five Georgia
cities recorded temperatures above the 100-degree mark Thursday,
the first day of summer, but temperatures were generally in the 80s
and 90s Friday afternoon.
   Rain showers and thunderstorms also stretched across Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi and southern Louisiana. Rain and
thundershowers were scattered over eastern and southwest Washington
and northwest Oregon.
   Locally heavy rain from thunderstorms brought urban flooding to
northeast and east central Wisconsin.
   The low temperature for the nation Friday morning was 31 degrees
at Jackson, Wyo.
   Temperatures in the Lower 48 states at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Sawyer Air Force Base at Marquette, Mich., to 107
degrees at both Palm Springs, Calif., and Phoenix, Ariz.

   The northern spotted owl's listing as a
threatened species marks ``a dark day in the history of the Pacific
Northwest,'' leading loggers said Friday.
   Environmentalists said the listing was long overdue, adding they
wanted to see what steps federal agencies would take to protect the
uncut forests where the two-foot-tall brown bird lives.
   The Interior Department, citing evidence the owl may become
extinct, ordered the reclusive bird protected as a threatened
species Friday. But it postponed until Tuesday an announcement of a
plan that will determine how much logging is to be permitted in the
owl's habitat.
   ``The listing by itself will not protect the owl or the ancient
forests,'' said Melanie Rowland of the Wilderness Society's office
in Seattle. ``The key is what the agencies are going to do, and how
much politics interferes with biology.''
   Members of the Northwest Forest Resource Council, which
represents the timber companies and 131,000 workers, told a news
conference they would seek to limit the bans on logging by
emphasizing the economic impact of setting aside land for owls.
   The government estimates that as many as 28,000 timber industry
jobs could be lost in the next decade in Oregon, Washington and
northern California. Entire logging communities could be disrupted
by the logging restrictions.
   The listing ``represents a dark day in the history of the
Pacific Northwest,'' said Gary Jones, president of Summit Timber Co.
   While the Endangered Species Act requires listing of a species
be made on scientific evidence alone, it has a provision that gives
an endangered species committee, including Cabinet members and
other state and federal officials, the power to modify how the
listing is enacted.
   Jones said the council was considering a lawsuit against the
Fish and Wildlife Service, and would probably go to court if plans
to protect the owl failed to provide sufficient protection for
logging.
   Environmentalists said the declaration should mark the end of an
era.
   ``The timber frontier is over,'' said Rick Johnson of the Sierra
Club. ``This is the clear indication where you cannot go over the
next hillside and have something to cut. We have a limited and
finite timber base and we have to have some understanding of the
consequences of what that logging will have.''
   People in the logging towns claim that environmental groups,
many of whose constituents are urban dwellers, don't understand how
damaging the decision will be to a way of life.
   ``It's like Boeing leaving Seattle. What would that be like?''
said Jerry Leppell, president of the American Loggers Solidarity
Committee in Forks.
   Timber is the leading industry in Oregon and also is key in
Washington. The governors of both states said they would lobby
against overly strict owl recovery plans.
   ``Federal legislation is needed to protect some old-growth
forests while allowing logging to continue without administrative
delays in others,'' said Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington said the ruling ``presents a
challenge to the Northwest. Clearly, what the timber communities
and workers need is assurance of an ongoing and adequate timber
supply.'' He said the federal government should provide special
assistance to communities hurt by the decision.
   According to a federal study, at least 8.4 million acres of the
timberlands should be preserved as habitat to save the owl from
extinction. The area is equivalent to a swath about 5 miles wide
stretching from Los Angeles to New York City.
   About 5.4 million acres of owl habitat already are in national
parks or wilderness areas off limits to logging, so an additional 3
million acres would have to be withdrawn.

<TEXT>
   Two lawmakers who opposed one another on a
constitutional amendment banning desecration of the flag joined
forces Friday to support a measure to end imports of U.S. flags,
most of which come from Taiwan.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, voted against the proposed
constitutional amendment on Thursday. Rep. Harley O. Staggers Jr.,
D-W.Va., voted for it.
   On Wednesday they introduced a bill of their own to ban imported
flags. On Thursday the proposed amendment failed to get the
necessary three-fourths vote in the House, despite strong support
from President Bush.
   At Alamo Flags in Dallas, Texas, a major dealer, an employee
said imported flags were much cheaper. An aide to Bryant said 90
percent of them came from Taiwan and smaller quantities from China
and Hong Kong.
   He added that when Bush, a fellow Texan, went into Bryant's
district two years ago to campaign against him, Bush supporters
were waving flags made in Taiwan.
   The Senate will vote on the proposed amendment Tuesday but its
vote will have no practical effect and no further action on the
propoal is likely this year. The issue is expected to be widely
used during the campaign leading to the congressional elections in
November.
   During the debate on Thursday, when it seemed likely that the
proposed amendment would be defeated, Bryant and Staggers sent
letters to the other members of the House, seeking co-sponsors for
their bill. An aide to Bryant said Friday that there had been no
response yet.
   The bill would set up an official United States Flag Commission
to regulate the manufacture and use of flags.
   ``The commission may only grant a license to manufacture
official flags of the United States if such flag will be
manufactured in the United States,'' the bill says.
   The Commerce Department reported that the United States imported
321,877 flags in the first four months of this year, more than
twice as many as the 132,667 brought in during all of 1989.
   The Bryant-Staggers bill would punish with a $5,000 fine the
sale of a flag not made in the United States. Anyone already owning
such a flag could submit it to the commission for designation as an
``official flag''.
   The bill also calls for a 1-year prison sentence and a fine of
$5,000 for anyone ``who knowingly mutilates, burns, tramples upon,
or otherwise damages an official flag of the United States.'' The
Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional two laws with similar
provisions to this, prompting the unsuccessful effort to pass a
constitutional amendment.
   The new bill says a flag may be burned if it's no longer in
condition for display.

   Winnie Mandela on Friday condemned
``necklacing'' and said a statement she made on South African
militants' practice of killing with burning tires had been reported
out of context.
   The wife of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela made
the comment in a morning interview with Phil Donahue, whose
syndicated talk show was to air in some areas of the country Friday
and others on Monday.
   Mrs. Mandela later had lunch with the U.N. African Mothers'
Association, and in the afternoon spoke at a Brooklyn church
symposium of about 200 women active in civic and religious
organizations.
   They included Joyce Dinkins, the mayor's wife; Manhattan Borough
President Ruth Messinger; Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman; Hazel
Dukes, head of the local NAACP; Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow;
and ``Mother'' Clara Hale, founder of a Harlem home for babies sick
from crack, AIDS and other maladies.
   Mrs. Mandela later attended a tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, where she listened to Sweet Honey in the Rock, an acapella
group known for its songs calling for black liberation.
   In brief remarks, Mrs. Mandela said the ANC would go to war if
negotiations to end apartheid stall.
   ``If talks fall apart and they very well might, we know you will
be there to take up arms with us,'' Mrs. Mandela told the sold-out
crowd of 2,000.
   Much of the audience jumped out of their seats with shouts of
support for her statement.
   Speaking at the earlier church meeting, Mrs. Mandela described
the social problems encumbering blacks in South Africa, including a
high infant mortality rate, inadequate health care and schools.
   ``Poverty and disease are the everyday companions of our
people,'' she said. ``This is our legacy, a legacy of apartheid.''
   ``In South Africa, we believe that if the women were in the
forefront, we would have long won our freedom,'' she said, winning
a roar of appreciation from the 200 women.
   In her comments on the Donahue program, Mrs. Mandela condemned
``necklacing'' _ killing government collaborators by putting a
gasoline-soaked burning tire around his neck _ as ``brutal and
barbaric.''
   The practice has been employed by some militants in
confrontations between rival groups in South Africa's black
shantytowns.
   Mrs. Mandela was quoted as telling a rally in South Africa in
1986: ``With our boxes of matches and our necklaces, we shall
liberate this country.'' She reiterated Friday her claim that the
comment was quoted out of context.
   ``Our children have been so oppressed and met up with such
violence from the government that they have resorted to that method
of eliminating their enemies,'' she said.
   ``That was not the form or method approved by the ANC. No sane
person would ever approve of that.''

   The Soviet Union said Friday that a united
Germany would have the right to eventually join NATO but only after
a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and U.S.
troops would leave the country.
   The United States, supported by the Western Allies, rejected the
plan as a delaying tactic.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the proposal during
unification talks involving the four World War II Allies and the
two German states.
   Shevardnadze also proposed pulling U.S. Soviet, British and
French troops out of Berlin within six months of a German merger,
which could take place by the end of year.
   At a news conference afterward, Shevarnadze said, ``We would
like to build a new Europe without military confrontation.''
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters the
plan would leave Berlin, which is expected to become Germany's
capital again, surrounded by 380,000 Soviet troops.
   As for all of Germany, Shevardnadze proposed a 50 percent
reduction in foreign forces over five years from East and West
Germany, and then over an unspecified period removing all of them
except ``token contingents.''
   Over a five-year transitional period, Shevardnadze said, East
and West Germany would be obliged to maintain ``all concluded
international treaties and agreements'' now in effect.
   Western diplomats interpreted this statement as a Soviet attempt
to delay NATO membership for the merged Germany.
   However, Shevardnadze went on to say that afterward, ``the
united Germany within its rights can conclude international
agreements unhindered by other considerations.'' He thereby gave
approval to the Germans' right to join any alliance after the
five-year period.
   Baker replied: ``Why not let the sovereign, unified Germany make
that decision?''
   He said the withdrawal of foreign forces should not be imposed
on the Germans in the final settlement to be worked out by the
Allies _ the United States, Britain, France and Soviet Union _ and
the East German and West German foreign ministers.
   The question of a united Germany's military stance is the
biggest obstacle to that agreement. The United States wants the new
country to be a member of the Western alliance, NATO. The Soviet
Union opposes NATO membership for Germany.
   Currently, West Germany is in NATO and East Germany is a member
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Shevardnadze's plan would have the effect of delaying full
sovereignty for a united Germany since during the five-year
transition period, it could not declare itself a member of NATO.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could
join NATO. The official said the other Western ministers expressed
the same reservations.
   A senior West German official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told reporters his government was opposed to a
transition period but that there might be room for a ``winding-down
process.''
   A senior British offical, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that ``everyone rejected the idea of a transition
period.''
   The British official said that a united Germany must have ``full
sovereignity'' and not be subject to discriminatory treatment.
   Despite the disagrement, Shevardnadze said he expected the
Allies would reach agreement on German unification by the end of
this year. The two German nations already are planning joint
elections for December.
   On another difficult issue, the ministers agreed to meet in
Paris on July 17 to consider Poland's concern about its border with
Germany. Poland is concerned that lands ceded to it from Germany
after World War II may be lost to reunification.
   Shevardnadze said his proposal regarding troops on German soil
was an outline on which the Kremlin was prepared to compromise. It
also contained the following provisions:
   1. The united Germany must not produce, possess, receive or
deploy nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
   2. The Four Power occupation of Berlin that has existed since
World War II would end within six months of the formation of a
single German government.
   3. The final settlement being drafted by the six nations should
propose measures to limit the size of Germany's armed forces.
   4. NATO and the Warsaw Pact would agree on a new code of conduct
toward each other in which the two alliances no longer would be
``potential military adversaries.''

escaped from a traveling circus, the government news agency Telam
reported Friday.
   The lions were shot and killed by police.
   The incident occurred Thursday evening in this town 90 miles

   Tamil separatist guerrillas hacked to
death 62 Moslem men, women and children in eastern Sri Lanka on
Friday after accusing them of being government informants.
   A Defense Ministry official and a Moslem leader said the village
massacre at Nintavur came on the 11th day of an increasingly
violent war between Tamil guerrillas and Sri Lankan forces for
control of the northeast. The separatists are also believed to have
gunned down 278 unarmed policemen last week.
   In the north, rebel forces overran one army base and attacked
four other strategic government garrisons. Ethnic strife between
Tamils and Sinhalese spread to south and central Sri Lanka.
Military officials said at least 139 more people died in fighting
that has already left more than 1,400 people dead.
   The government announced more than 210,000 people had fled the
bloodshed, seeking shelter in temporary refugee camps in schools,
temples, churches and mosques across Sri Lanka.
   Troops found the bodies of 62 Moslem men, women and children in
Nintavur, a village 28 miles south of Batticaloa town, a Defense
Ministry statement said. Corpses were found floating inside water
wells.
   Military officials said rebels used knives to kill the villagers
instead of guns so the noise wouldn't alert security forces posted
nearby.
   Survivors said the rebels raided the village early Friday
because they feared villagers would reveal the site of their jungle
hideout, according to Mahroof Gani, an official of the Sri Lanka
Moslem Congress, an opposition party.
   Earlier this week, government attacks in the east pushed the
rebels into the jungle.
   ``It was a slaughter of innocent Moslem men, women and
children,'' Gani said, calling the rebels ``bloodthirsty
criminals.''
   He said after killing villagers, the rebels set fire to a
mosque, looted and burned down the village's 150 houses and left
placards written in red paint warning Moslems not to work for the
government.
   The government on Thursday claimed its troops had captured the
strategic east coast region from the Tamil Tigers, who are fighting
for a separate Tamil homeland. The rebels contend Tamils are
discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority.
   But an Associated Press reporter who visited the area on
Thursday and Friday found the rebels appeared to control large
parts of the region. The coastal town of Batticaloa, which the
government claimed to have captured, was virtually deserted.
   In Batticaloa, the three-story police station, gutted by a fire
set by Tamil rebels, was empty and shops were boarded up. Several
people roamed the streets searching for food, which residents say
is running short after nearly two weeks of fighting.
   Government troops only controlled an airstrip on Batticaloa's
outskirts. On the roads, rebels could be seen driving tractor
trailers, loaded with looted food, soap and other essentials.
   A 25-year-old rebel leader, who identified himself only as
Newton, said the Tigers had withdrawn from most of the major towns
in the east and were readying for guerrilla war.
   ``From now on there will be no negotiations. We will ambush and
attack government troops,'' he said, cocking his new Chinese-made
automatic rifle as he spoke to reporters in Pullamalia, a village
near Batticaloa.
   Eight miles away, Sinhalese police peered warily from their
bunkers in Maha Oya. No one was allowed in or out of the town
without police permission.
   Tamil rebels took reporters on a tour of the east coast region
in an effort to show they were still in control.
   At Periyaparativu, a village 12 miles south of Batticaloa, most
of the 300 homes were gutted. Rebels and some villagers claimed the
homes had been destroyed by government troops before they withdrew.
   ``When the army came here last week, the people fled. When they
withdrew, we returned,'' said a 26-year-old Tamil university
student.
   The Tamil Tigers have been waging a seven-year insurgency to set
up a separate state in the north and east where Tamils predominate.
The fighting flared again on June 11 when the rebels abrogated a
13-month-old cease-fire by attacking police stations after a Tamil
civilian complained he was manhandled by Sinhalese police.
   Tamils, who are predominantly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. The Buddhist Sinhalese comprise 75
percent, while Moslems constitute seven percent.

   A $77.5 million plan to convert a
vacant electronics mill into the world's largest contemporary art
museum is a ``risky venture'' that won't work, a state official
said.
   ``In my view, it's not legal,'' Inspector General Joseph Barresi
said Friday in a telephone interview from his Boston office.
Barresi is responsible for pointing out fraud and waste in
government.
   In a report released Thursday, Barresi said the city of North
Adams had ``no credible plan'' to raise the more than $10 million
required as its share for the first phase of construction.
   Without that money, the state cannot legally proceed with any
spending for construction, Barresi said. Bids were scheduled to be
let this year.
   He also contended a proposed plan to have a private developer
build the building and lease it to the museum is not allowed under
Massachusetts bidding laws. And he warned that the venture could
end up costing North Adams taxpayers hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year, if attendance didn't meet ``optimistic''
projections of 150,000 visitors a year.
   Two years ago, the Legislature authorized $35 million to help
convert the vacant, 28-building Sprague Electronics Co. mill
complex into an art museum. But release of the money depends on
acceptance of a feasibility study by state planning and finance
officials as well as a museum commission.
   Local officials in North Adams hope a museum to house
ultracontemporary artworks, many of them room-sized, will boost the
economy of this industrial town of 18,000. Critics question whether
it could ever attract enough people to the town, at least 2{ hours
by car from Boston.
   The idea of using the huge complex as an art museum was devised
by Thomas Krens, then director of the Williams College Art Museum
in nearby Williamstown and now director of the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum in New York. An Italian art collector, Count
Giuseppe Panza di Biuomo, has said he is willing to make a
long-term loan of 300 works to the museum.
   State Rep. Daniel Bosley, who represents North Adams and
strongly supports the museum plan, criticized Barresi for issuing
his report.
   ``It's not his job to pass judgment on a project,'' Bosley said.
``That's for others to do.'' But Bosley said he may seek to amend
the enabling legislation to change the financing requirements to
meet Barresi's objections.
   Krens was traveling abroad Friday and could not be reached for
comment on Barresi's criticisms, while North Adams Mayor John
Barrett III was not available for comment because of a death in his
family, his office said.
   Barresi said North Adams taxpayers need to be aware that they
museum ``is a risky venture. ... The feasibility study relies on
optimistic forecasts.''
   The study, released in April, contends upwards of 150,000 people
annually would be willing to travel to the town in the northern
Berkshires and pay $6.50 apiece to view ultramodern work such as a
300-foot sculpture of lighted neon tubes.
   But the well-established Clark Art Institute with free admission
in nearby Williamstown gets just 120,000 visitors annually, Barresi
said. If the proposed museum got that many visitors _ 30,000 fewer
than its break-even target _ it would run a $274,000 deficit that
would have to be made up by the taxpayers, he said.

<TEXT>
   The defense rested in the latest Bensonhurst
murder trial Friday after calling four black men who drove from
Ohio to tell jurors the defendant was a good friend and not a
racist.
   Napoleon Bonaparte Brown said he and defendant John Vento became
``best friends'' in the seven or eight years they've known each
other. The two worked together in a Dayton, Ohio, pizzeria owned by
Vento's brother.
   ``Johnny's an A-OK guy amongst me and my friends,'' Brown
testified.
   Yusuf Hawkins, 16, was shot to death after he and three friends,
all black, crossed paths with a gang of bat-wielding whites on a
street in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst neighborhood last August. The
highly publicized killing heightened racial tensions in New York
City.
   Last month, one white teen was convicted of murder and another
acquitted of murder but convicted of lesser charges in the case.
Other defendants are expected to stand trial later.
   Vento, 21, was put on trial after he backed out of an agreement
with prosecutors to testify against others in the case and fled the
city around Christmastime. He surrendered to authorities in March.
   Prosecutors attempted on Friday to have first- and second-degree
manslaughter added to the charges, but Justice Thaddeus Owens
refused when defense lawyer Gerald DiChiara objected.
   The state Supreme Court jury chosen to decide Vento's fate will
hear final arguments Monday before beginning their deliberations.
   Brown and Vento's other black friends said the allegations
against Vento hadn't diminished their feelings of friendship for
him. Brown said he didn't believe much of what he had heard and
read.
   ``You know how the media is _ they say what they want to,''
Brown told the jury.
   Vento lived with his brother in Dayton for several years, and
went back to Dayton after fleeing New York six months ago. In his
testimony Friday, Brown said Vento gave himself up the day after he
had confided that he was in trouble in New York.
   Under cross-examination, Brown acknowledged that Vento hadn't
told him that he was wanted for his role in the murder of an
unarmed black teen-ager. Brown learned the details only from news
reports, he said.
   Vento confided ``basically something went down in his
neighborhood and it was real big. That was enough for me,'' Brown
said. ``We're best friends. I said, `Whatever it is, go straighten
it out.'''
   Other defense witnesses included a woman from Bensonhurst, a
police officer and three more of Vento's black friends who drove
from Dayton on Thursday to testify.

   Lisa Jones, a teen-age runaway who became a
$100,000-a-year trading assistant at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
was sentenced Friday to 10 months in prison for lying to a grand
jury investigating Wall Street fraud.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand reduced the 18-month
sentence Jones received last year after an appeals court threw out
the term on grounds it was longer than mandated by federal
sentencing guidelines.
   Sand also fined Jones $25,000 and ordered her to pay $14,850 for
the cost of her incarceration. He required Jones to receive mental
health treatment during her term.
   Jones, 27, was convicted in March 1989 of seven counts of
perjury and obstruction of justice for lying in January 1988 to a
federal grand jury investigating trading activities at Drexel.
   Sand said he was sympathetic to Jones' psychological problems
and troubled childhood _ she ran away from home at age 14 _ but
said deterrence was necessary because she lied repeatedly to
investigators.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil S. Cartusciello said Jones still
had not cooperated with the government. He also said there was
nothing to indicate she was suffering from ``diminished mental
capacity'' at the time of her crimes.
   Jones, who worked at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond
department, was the first person convicted in the government's
lengthy investigation of fraud on Wall Street.
   Prosecutors showed at her trial that Jones handled transactions
that constituted illegal stock ``parking,'' which typically
involves hiding the true ownership of securities.
   In three appearances before the grand jury, Jones said she did
not recall any discussions about stock parking in contacts with
Princeton-Newport Partners LP. The principals of the defunct
investment firm were convicted last July in a scheme to generate
illegal tax losses through bogus securities trading.
   Jones was an assistant to Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, who was
convicted in the Princeton-Newport case and sentenced to three
months in prison.
   Newberg reported directly to Michael Milken, the ex-head of
Drexel's junk bond department who pleaded guilty to six felonies
and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties earlier this year to
settle fraud charges.
   The government showed that Jones had a history of lying _ about
her age, birthplace, job title and other matters. She lied about
150 times during testimony at her trial, they said.

   Manholes have disappeared from the
streets of California's capital city, replaced, in deference to the
city council's female majority, with ``maintenance holes.''
   The Public Works department in April announced an informal
contest to find a gender-neutral name for the places in the street
where workers go to make underground repairs.
   The contest brought suggestions from far-flung locations. A
radio station in Hamilton, New Zealand _ Sacramento's sister city _
came up with ``sewer viewer.'' Others suggested ``peopleholes'' or
even ``peepholes.''
   ``The Nonsexist Word Finder: A Dictionarty of Gender-Free
Usage,'' by Rosalie Maggio, proffers ``sewer hole'' or ``utility
access hole.''
   The city council was to have named a winner at a May 9 meeting,
it ducked the issue.
   The new name came finally without any fuss: Reporters noticed
that ``maintenance hole'' had replaced ``manhole'' in a sewer code
packet adopted without discussion by the council on Tuesday.
   The women on the council never ordered the name changed. The
idea came from city engineering staff members who noted women
controlled the council.
   ``I noticed the different references in the staff report, but I
don't know why they handled it that way,'' Mayor Anne Rudin said.
``I think they just wanted the matter to quiet down.''
   Public works officials said the new name was adopted for a
practical reason: Officials won't have to change the ``MH''
abbreviations already in use on city utility maps.

<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese folk singer sent back home by
China seven years after he defected to that country said Friday he
would have preferred to remain in Beijing to continue criticizing
the Communist Chinese leadership.
   ``It was not my plan to come back to Taiwan at this moment,''
Hou Dejian told reporters one day after being released on bail by
Taiwanese authorities. ``I wanted to stay in China and remain an
acceptable, reasonable dissident.''
   Hou, 34, and two others disappeared May 31 in Beijing just hours
before they were to issue an open letter to Chinese leaders calling
for the release of political prisoners.
   The singer said Chinese authorities had accused him of spreading
rumors about the death toll in the June 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. Hundreds, and perhaps
thousands, of people died.
   Hou said Chinese authorities offered him a choice of either
going to prison or being sent back to Taiwan.
   ``I didn't want to go to jail, and I don't want to be
irrational. So I chose to come back,'' Hou told a news conference
at a Taipei hotel.
   The two others seized, Gao Xin and Zhou Duo, resurfaced earlier
this week in Beijing. Gao said he had spent the two weeks
``vacationing'' under police supervision.
   Hou arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday aboard a fishing boat.
Prosecutors said they would review Hou's case to determine if he
entered Taiwan illegally, but Premier Hau Pei-tsun indicated the
folk singer would not be sent to jail.
   ``Since he turned himself in, there shouldn't be any serious
consequences,'' the premier said Friday.
   Hou was a popular folk singer in Taiwan when he defected to
China in 1983 in what he described as a move to seek his roots. His
father was a soldier in the Nationalist army that retreated to
Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist forces on the
Chinese mainland.
   Hou was one of four young intellectuals who staged a hunger
strike in Beijing during the pro-democracy movement's final days.
   Following the military crackdown, Hou took refuge in the
Australian Embassy in Beijing for more than two months until the
Chinese government promised he would not be arrested.
   After leaving the embassy, he was one of the few Chinese to
continue to publicly call for democratic reform.

   For the 20 months after her AIDS diagnosis,
Kathy and Chris Pitkin made the most of the life she had left by
caring for her at home. She lived well with AIDS, instead of simply
dying well with it.
   The 20 months of care before her death in 1988 cost $150,000, 80
percent of it for six hospital visits. The cost of home care, which
helped extend and improve her life, had to come out of Pitkin's
pocket.
   ``It's one of the most frustrating things we face,'' said Merle
Sande, chief of medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, during
a panel discussion Friday in connection with the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS.
   ``We can get resources if you hospitalize a patient. But to take
care of them at home _ to focus on the quality of life _ to try to
keep them out of the hospital, you can't get support for it. It
doesn't make any sense.''
   As AIDS enters its second decade, care-givers, community AIDS
groups and people infected with the deadly virus are talking about
quality of life _ home care, good nutrition and critical emotional
support _ and how it can help lengthen life and give them a sense
of control over a disease that often seems out of control.
   It's easier to see what's needed in the bigger picture than it
is to find money to pay for it.
   ``Finding the resources to support it is almost harder to do
than finding the resources to support what it takes to die well,''
said Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, a
Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group.
   The Council recently challenged the continuing reviews of Social
Security and Medicaid benefits of people with AIDS. Ironically,
current drug therapies were often improving the health of AIDS
patients so dramatically that they were deemed no longer eligible
for the benefits that had given them access the very medical care
that had helped them, she said.
   Kathleen Squires was an intern at a Philadelphia hospital in
1981 when patients started popping up with an illness no one could
identify.
   ``By the time these patients presented at the hospital, they
never made it out of the hospital again,'' said Squires, now
assistant attending physician at New York Hospital. ``They were
subjected to every test known to man, and every kind of medication.
And in terms of quality of life _ there was none.''
   In many cases, there still is none. Doctors have to begin
incorporating those concerns into their mainstream care,
psychiatrist Stuart Nichols said.
   ``We have to go beyond what doctors can do for patients. We can
help patients live longer and function better. But quality of life
ultimately depends on having the courage to look at your life and
see if you're doing enough with it, doing the kind of things you
want,'' said Nichols of Beth Israel Hospital in New York.
   Physicians tend to focus too narrowly on the negative aspects of
AIDS, he said.
   ``If you ask most doctors about the basic psychological response
to being diagnosed, they'd tell you about the catastrophic reaction
where your sense of who you are and where you're going is wiped
out,'' he said. ``But they seem to forget entirely there's a
second, and more important phase, where the patient (emerges) with
a new sense of who they are, a new sense of what they want to do,
with new friends, new goals in life.''
   Pitkin, who learned he was HIV positive six years ago, has all
but abandoned the conservative lifestyle that found him pursuing an
advanced business degree and socking away retirement money.
Attitude is everything, he believes.
   ``That's the thing with AIDS. It's like, death and dying and
everything's going to hell,'' he said. ``Let's get out and play
some golf, do some sailing and have some fun.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, responding to repeated urgings by the United States,
late Friday gave new assurances that his government would keep
allowing Jews to leave the country.
   Shevardnadze, however, requested Israel keep the refugees from
settling on the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip territories.
   ``We have very good reasons to insist,'' Shevardnadze said after
a two-hour meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The session was held after a conference on Germany's future,
attended also by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, East
Germany and West Germany.
   Before flying home to Moscow, the foreign minister said the
Soviet parliament would complete legislation establishing the right
to emigrate.
   That would meet a precondition set by the Bush administration
for lowering tariffs against Soviet products.
   Baker raised the issue after Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev threatened to suspend Jewish emigration, which is now at
an all-time high, if some of the refugees are settled in the lands
formerly held by Jordan and Egypt.
   But Shevardnadye told reporters: ``As for our practice in regard
to emigration, nothing has changed.''
   Two weeks ago, Shevardnadye gave similar assurances to Baker
during a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark. But then Gorbachev raised
the possibility again, as he had at the Washington summit with Bush
that ended June 3.

   Two defense contractor employees were
convicted for conspiracy in U.S. District Court after they stole
and distributed secret weapons systems documents, officials said on
Friday.
   Frank J. Caso, a former hughes Aircraft Co. employee in Canoga
Park, Calif., and John R. Kiely, a Raytheon Co. employee in
Bedford, Mass., had conspired to obtain the documents in the early
1970s, said a statement from Defense Department Inspector General
Susan J. Crawford.
   The two men had worked together to distribute the documents to
other defense contractors and employees, the court ruled. Other
conspirators and their employers have already been convicted.
   Hughes Aircraft earlier pleaded guilty to related charges and
paid $3.67 million to settle the criminal and civil charges.
Raytheon also agreed to pay $1 million, the statement said.
   The convictions stem from an investigation called Operation
Uncover that targeted unlawful traffickers of classified documents
by top defense contractors and their employees.

<HEAD>Iran Says Yes to Earthquake Aid from Private US Agencies</HEAD>

   The U.S. government Friday night prepared to
airlift blankets, tents and other items for earthquake victims in
Iran after being informed by Iranian authorities that American
assistance would be welcome.
   The relief items were to donated through the American Red Cross.
Iran had informed the State Department that it was willing to
accept contributions from that agency or similar private
organizations.
   The State Department said the goods, valued at $225,000, were to
be flown via charter from a U.S. government logistics base near
Pisa, Italy. The charter cost was listed at $66,000.
   ``We want to be helpful without regard for our political
differences with Iran,'' said deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
Iranian officials put the death toll at more than 36,000.
   The State Department said the U.S. contribution would consist of
1,000 hard hats, 1,000 leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940
wool blankets, 160 5-gallon water jugs and 800 tents.
   Meanwhile, in Stamford, Conn., the Americares relief
organization said it would send a medical team and 80,000 pounds of
supplies to Iran on Saturday.
   ``We really can't be perceived as so bad if we reach out to the
people there,'' said Terry Tarnowski, who has worked for AmeriCares
since it was founded in 1982.
   There have been only rare instances of U.S.-Iranian cooperation
since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago.
The United States holds Iran partly responsible for the continued
detention of American hostages by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor
agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent Society, a
humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance.
   The U.S. government routinely channels humanitarian assistance
through the Red Cross and other donor groups.
   Pat Davis, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, said the
agency has donated $50,000 in cash and is accepting cash donations
for the purchase of blankets, medicines, clothes and flashlights.
   She said checks payable to Iran Relief can be sent to the
American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C. 20013. Checks
also can be sent to local Red Cross chapters.
   Boucher said the Iranian message to the United States presumably
was delivered through a third party but added that he was
uncertain. Messages between the two countries normally are handled
by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.
   The type of help U.S. charitable groups could send would be
based on the recommendations of a U.N. disaster relief team that
has been sent to the affected area.
   The Iranian message came a day after the Bush administration
responded to the tragedy in the northwest part of the country with
a message of condolences and an offer of humanitarian aid.
   Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries
except Israel and South Africa. U.S. officials said an American
offer of aid after an earlier natural disaster in Iran was rejected.

   Large-scale testing of AIDS vaccines could
begin in two years and a vaccine could be widely available by the
middle of the 1990s, researchers said Friday.
   In an address at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS, Dr.
Jay A. Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute said the most
effective vaccines will probably be synthetic _ made through
recombinant DNA technology, or genetic engineering.
   ``We're now in a position to take advantage of recent advances
in immunology to design an artificial vaccine,'' Berzofsky said.
``And it should be possible to develop such a vaccine in the near
future.''
   Near the Moscone Center convention hall, more than 200
protesters, mostly women, gathered in the latest of a string of
daily demonstrations sponsored by ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition To
Unleash Power.
   More than 140 people were arrested when the group of
demonstrators marched from near the convention hall into the center
of an intersection and lay down in a symbolic ``die-in.''
   Another group of 100 activists demonstrated Friday afternoon in
front of the Hall of Justice.
   Friday's demonstration focused on what ACT UP contends is the
exclusion of women, children and minorities from research,
treatment and other services.
   Many protesters bound themselves to metal barricades with
symbolic red paper chains, chanting, ``Women die faster, this is a
disaster,'' and waved signs reading ``Health Care Now,'' Women Gets
AIDS Too'' and ``Prostitutes Make Safe Sex Their Business.''
   Catherine Ritter, a New York woman who said she has AIDS, said,
``I've been denied access to clinical trials, I've been denied
medical treatment.''
   Inside the conference, the AIDS vaccine group led by Dr. Jonas
Salk reported that the Salk AIDS vaccine has boosted immunity in
about 60 percent of the 82 people with AIDS virus infections who
have so far received it.
   The vaccine is intended not to prevent the AIDS infection, but
to ward off disease in people already infected.
   None have died up to two-and-a-half years after being given the
vaccine, said Alexandra M. Levine of the University of Southern
California. Three developed the AIDS-related cancer Kaposi's
sarcoma. One developed pneumonia and another developed an eye
infection, she said.
   The results were encouraging enough for the researchers to
announce that large-scale trials of the vaccine will begin in
several months with the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   A San Francisco community research group also reported
improvement in AIDS patients given a drug called compound Q,
derived from a Chinese herb.
   Before being given the drug, the patients suffered a steady
decline in immune system cells called CD4 cells. After
administration of the drug to 46 patients, 38 of the patients
showed either a stabilization of CD4 cells or an increase, said the
study's director, Martin Delaney.
   ``At this stage, we have seen a major and dramatic change in
what happens to these patients,'' Delaney said. But he said he
could not yet recommend that the drug be taken widely because of
potentially dangerous side effects.
   Wayne Koff, chief of the AIDS vaccine research branch at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the
most promising human vaccines should be ready for large-scale
testing in two or three years, and it will take two or three more
years to determine their effectiveness.
   ``So, we're still looking at the mid-to-late 1990s as a minimal
time frame for selection of a vaccine for general use,'' Koff said.
   ``I think there is reason to be more optimistic now, in 1990,
than at any previous international AIDS conference,'' he sid.
   Some 30 approaches toward the development of vaccines are now
being studied, Koff said. Half a dozen vaccines are already being
tested or are about to be tested in humans, he said.
   Optimism about an AIDS vaccine is spurred by recent successes
with vaccines in animals, said Dr. Murray B. Gardner of the
University of California, Davis.
   In Massachusetts, two of six monkeys given vaccines did not get
infected when exposed to the simian AIDS virus. In Louisiana,
vaccines prevented infection in eight of nine vaccinated monkeys.
At Gardner's primate research center, three of three monkeys
vaccinated were protected against infection.
   ``It should not be too long before these laboratory-successful
vaccines can be translated into HIV vaccines for the real world,''
Gardner said. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.
   Even if human vaccines aren't successful in protecting humans
against disease, they might well delay the onset of serious
symptoms of AIDS, Gardner said.
   The animal vaccines tested were so-called whole-virus vaccines.
They consist of killed AIDS viruses injected to trigger an immune
response that can defend against live AIDS virus.
   The danger in using such vaccines with humans, however, is that
there is some risk they will inadvertently transmit the disease,
because they contain intact AIDS viruses, researchers said.
   ``Because a synthetic vaccine would lack viral components, it
could not inadvertently cause AIDS,'' said Berzofsky. Furthermore,
such a vaccine could be designed to stimulate only those parts of
the immune system known to attack the AIDS virus, he said.
   Stimulation of other parts of the immune system could actually
intensify an AIDS infection, because those immune cells are
infected with the AIDS virus, he said.

<HEAD>Zaire Sharply Reduces Ties With Belgium Over Massacre Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zaire sharply reduced diplomatic and
other ties with Belgium on Friday in response to Brussels'
criticism of human rights abuses in the former Belgian colony,
according to news reports.
   The move came a month after Belgium ``froze'' relations with
Zaire over the May 12 massacre of students at the University of
Lubumbashi.
   On Friday, Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko accused Belgium of
meddling in Zaire's internal affairs.
   He suspended a 1989 accord under which Belgium canceled $311
million in debt and rescheduled another $399 million, halved the
four weekly flights from Brussels to Kinshasa, by Sabena, Belgium's
national airline, and closed three of Belgium's four consulates in
Zaire.
   He also ``put an end to the presence'' of hundreds of Belgians
working on development projects in Zaire, according to that
country's official news agency, Azap.
   Belgium denied it was interfering in Zairean affairs. Foreign
Minister Mark Eyskens summoned the Zairean ambassador to protest
Mobutu's actions.
   ``The government has only asked for clarifications about the
grave incidents that took place in Lubumbashi,'' the government
said in a statement.
   According to Belgian press reports, dozens of students were
killed at the university by masked members of Mobutu's personal
guard. The students apparently had beaten other students accused of
being spies for Mobutu.
   Students have been at the vanguard of opposition to one-party
rule in this central African country.
   On Thursday, U.S. lawmakers voted to cut off military aid to
Zaire over that country's human rights record. The decision by the
House Appropriations Committee is expected to be upheld by the full
House of Representatives when it debates the foreign aid bill next
week.
   Zaire, a country of 25 million residents, marks its 30th
anniversary since independence from Belgium at the end of this
month. Mobutu seized power in a 1965 coup and imposed
authoritarian, one-party rule.
   The U.S. State Department said recently in its annual human
rights report that security organizations in Zaire regularly
harass, detain and brutalize citizens.

   The highly publicized suicide of a member of
the Unitarian church focused new attention on the denomination's
liberal social stands as leaders began their annual conference
Friday.
   Two years ago, the church endorsed the right to die, and leaders
voiced support for Janet Adkins, an Alzheimer's disease patient who
used a suicide machine to end her life June 4.
   The issue was expected to be a prime topic of discussion at the
five-day annual conference of the Unitarian-Universalist
Association, said the Rev. William Schultz, the church's national
president.
   Schultz, who was scheduled to speak on the issue late Friday,
declined to say if he expected attempts to reverse the church's
support for euthanasia. He continues to support the principle, and
noted it is characteristic of the denomination, which has endorsed
homosexual marriages and marijuana legalization and prides itself
on its open-minded approach to social issues.
   ``Unitarian-Universalists have always affirmed that religion is
not a Sunday morning experience,'' Schultz said in an interview.
``Unitarian-Universalists believe religious principles need to be
brought to bear on public policy questions and the political events
of the day.''
   About 3,000 delegates were expected to attend the conference of
the Boston-based church, which claims about 190,000 members and
1,010 congregations nationally.
   Mrs. Adkins, of Portland, Ore., ended her life June 4 in a van
in a Detroit suburb. Dr. Jack Kevorkian hooked her up to a suicide
device he built, enabling the 54-year-old woman to give herself a
lethal dose of chemicals.
   Kevorkian hasn't been charged with a crime, but a court issued
an injunction barring further use of the machine.
   Unitarian-Universalists endorsed the right to die at their 1988
meeting. Leaders voiced support for Mrs. Adkins, though a Unitarian
minister in Michigan refused to let her use the machine inside a
church.
   Euthanasia is far from the first difficult issue for Schultz,
who has led the church since 1985.
   ``We have always been outspoken that we as religious people have
every right and even an obligation to speak out the truth as we see
it to those who govern us and who are in positions of power,'' he
said.
   At their general assembly in 1984, the church became the first
majopr denomination to sanction marriages between homosexual
couples.
   In 1975, the Unitarian-Universalists set up a national office
for homosexual concerns. In the early 1970s, it sponsored sex
education courses and passed a resolution calling for the
legalization of marijuana. It has long supported abortion rights,
and supported birth control as early as 1962.
   Schultz said unlike most mainstream Christian bodies, the church
doesn't have a single doctrine. Instead, it attempts to keep faith
as open and tolerant as possible.
   ``There is no theology that everyone is required to believe in,
but that doesn't mean there aren't common principles we adhere
to,'' he said. ``We believe the world, the universe is too grand,
too complex, too mysterious to be captured or capsulized in any one
creed on any one religious tradition.''
   The first Universalist church in North America was established
in Gloucester, Mass., in 1779. In 1961, it merged with the
Unitarian church, a 16th century church founded in Romania.

   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy offered
Friday to send humanitarian relief to Iran to help search for
trapped survivors of that country's killer earthquake.
   ``Israel is very sorry for the grave natural disaster in Iran
and is prepared to give the Iranians immediate aid as it has done
for various other nations,'' said Eliza Goren, Levy's spokeswoman.
   Iran reportedly said humanitarian aid would be welcomed from all
nations except South Africa and Israel.
   Goren said Levy made the offer through the League of
International Red Cross. Israel has had no diplomatic ties with
Iran since the Islamic revolution ousted the Shah in 1979.
   Dr. Mark Heller, a top researcher at the Jaffe Center for
Strategic Studies, said no one really expected the offer to be
accepted.
   ``I suspect that this is an attempt to demonstrate to the
Iranians that Israel has no intrinsic hostility to Iran,'' Heller
said. ``But I don't think that anyone seriously expects the Iranian
government will accept.''
   Levy's offer to Iran comes as the new right-wing government has
made various moves toward neighboring Arab states.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has invited Syrian President Hafez
Assad to unconditioned talks and published his phone number,
requesting any Arab states seeking peace to call.
   But Goren said Levy's offer to send a relief team to Iran was
made on humanitarian grounds only.
   Before Khomeini rose to power, Iran was an island of support for
the Jewish state in the Middle East, and home to a wealthy Jewish
community of about 60,000. It also provided 40 percent of Israel's
oil needs.
   Israel sent relief teams after Iran's September 1978 earthquake.
   Israel has hoped that President Ali Khamenei would be more
moderate than his predecessor.
   ``Israel has tried to cultivate better relations with Iran for a
long time but since the revolt the Iranian regime has been
extremely hostile to Israel,'' Heller said. ``The offer is
consistent with Israeli policy in the past the only change will be
if Iran actually accepts.''
   Clandestine contacts between Israel and Iran, however, have
continued. They largely involved the sale of weapons and spare
parts during Iran's eight-year war with Iraq.
   In December 1987, Israel sent a 42-member rescue team to search
for survivors in Soviet Armenia.

   Police arrested 140 AIDS activists Friday
after they blocked downtown traffic to protest claims that women
are denied access to AIDS treatment and research.
   The protest marked the fourth day of demonstrations by AIDS and
gay rights activists, many who traveled to San Francisco for the
Sixth International AIDS Conference.
   Friday's arrests brought the total to 299. Nearly all the
protests have taken place outside the conference. The only incident
inside the Moscone Center came Friday morning when several
demonstrators briefly interrupted a morning seminar. There were no
arrests.
   The demonstration, a few blocks from the conference, included a
march and several women speakers, including those advocating the
rights of prostitutes.
   The crowd shouted slogans such as, ``Women die faster, it's a
disaster,'' and ``NIH we think you're vile. We need clinical
trials.''
   The call refers to the National Institutes of Health's trials of
experimental drug, which rely heavily on male subjects.
   ``I've been denied access to clinical trials and I've been
denied medical care,'' Catherine Ritter, a New York woman with AIDS
told the crowd, as a number of women tied themselves to police
barricades with red paper chains.
   Carol Leigh, a self-professed prostitute from San Francisco
complained that prostitutes are being wrongly persecuted as AIDS
carriers.
   Dressed in a Gay 90s music hall dress and a red feather boa,
Leigh said prostitutes help stop the spread of disease by using
condoms.
   ``Prostitutes are safe-sex educators,'' she said.
   Protesters moved from their spot near the Moscone Center and
marched through crowded lunchtime streets, chanting and blowing
whistles before finally halting for a ``die-in'' at a busy
intersection.
   Police issued what has become a standard warning to clear the
street. When a group of protesters elected to stay, police circled
them and began the long process of arresting them as noon time
shoppers and other demonstrators looked on. Most were booked for
failure to disperse and then released.
   A half hour later, a second group of demonstrators ran back into
the street, starting the process all over again.
   Many shoppers were trapped on the street until police finished
the arrests. Most watched patiently, but some expressed frustration
with the week of demonstrations that have tied up the city.
   ``I can understand their emotions, but I question their
tactics,'' said Lillian Schneiderman, a shopper from nearby East
Bay.
   But not everyone was aware of the ongoing protests. An elderly
woman, startled by the crowds, asked what was going on. When told
it was an AIDS demonstration, her face wrinkled in disgust.
   ``It's their own fault, she said. ``They shouldn't have ever
taken that stuff.''

   A constitutional accord aimed at keeping
French-speaking Quebec in the Canadian federation died late Friday
and a government official blamed the premier of Newfoundland.
   The agreement, which would have designated Quebec a ``distinct
society,'' had to be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight
Saturday. All but Newfoundland and Manitoba had ratified the
so-called Meech Lake accord.
   Newfoundland's Premier Clyde Wells on Friday night suspended
debate indefinitely on the measure, a move that effectively killed
the accord, said Sen. Lowell Murray, Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's top constitutional adviser.
   Murray said Mulroney would address this nation of 26 million
residents on Saturday.
   Quebec's Premier Robert Bourassa told his provincial legislature
Friday that ``the Meech Lake accord has not been ratified.''
   ``In the name of all Quebecois, I want to express my profound
disappointment,'' he said.
   The federal government had made a last-ditch effort to save the
accord through a Supreme Court extension of the deadline.
Government lawyers believed that only Quebec's ratification, which
took place June 23, 1987 and started the process, would expire
Saturday night.
   But Murray said an extension of the deadline would only have
worked if preceded by a positive vote in Newfoundland, one of
Canada's poorest provinces with about 500,000 residents.
   Earlier, the Manitoba legislature pushed the agreement close to
death when it was forced to adjourn by the lone Indian member of
the assembly. The lawmaker wanted constitutional recognition of
Indian tribes as distinct people.
   ``Manitoba did its best, but was obstructed. Premier Wells'
decision to break his committment and not hold his vote tonight
killed the last hope for Meach Lake to succeed,'' Murray said.
   In Newfoundland, Wells said he felt Meech Lake ``is wrong for
the long-term future of Canada and wrong for the long-term future
for this province.''
   The five-point agreement, first approved by the prime minister
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987, is aimed at winning
Quebec's signature on Canada's 1982 constitution. In that year, the
ministers set a three-year deadline for approval by the Parliament
and legislatures.
   But in the interim, governments changed in three of the
provinces _ Manitoba, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick _ and the
premiers reneged on the signatures of their predecessors.
   In early June, Mulroney called the premiers to Ottawa, where
they spent a week in intense private meetings. They agreed to pass
the original accord as it is. New Brunswick passed it last week.
   The dithering over the accord has given rise to increased
nationalist sentiment in Quebec. It has been implied that if the
Meech Lake accord is not ratified, Quebec, which contains
one-fourth of Canada's population, will have to rethink its role in
the Canadian federation.
   ``English Canada must clearly understand ... Quebec is today and
forever a distinct society,'' Bourassa told the legislature.
   Opposition Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau extended his
hand to Bourassa ``to work together'' to find a new path for Quebec.
   ``Let's just accept the idea of being together and discussing
the future among ourselves,'' Parizeau said.
   Manitoba's delay was the work of legislator Elijah Harper, who
managed to put off a vote on the accord in Winnipeg.
   On Friday, the Manitoba legislature legally was required to
adjourn in the early afternoon unless it extended its session
unanimously. Harper, holding an eagle feather, uttered ``no.''
   ``We will use every tactic to make sure that the aboriginal
people are heard,'' said Harper, a Cree Indian.
   Quebec's minister for intergovernmental affairs, Gil Remillard,
said Thursday that if Meech Lake was not ratified, Quebec would not
make another effort to revive the process and would start looking
for something else.
   ``We will not start again,'' Remillard said. ``We've had enough.
That's it.''
   There has been speculation Quebec may again threaten to secede
from Canada.

   A government official on Friday warned British
newspapers that they could face legally binding controls if they
fail to take steps to within one year to stop invasions of privacy.
   Home Secretary David Waddington, writing in the Times of London,
said it was the ``last chance'' for the newspapers to police
themselves before the government intervenes.
   ``We will not flinch from introducing statutory regulation of
the press,'' Waddington said. ``We all hope that it will not come
to this. But it is up to the industry _ proprietors, editors and
journalists _ to realize this hope, for no one else can.''
   Britain's racy tabloids, the prime target of the ultimatum,
conjured up a dire vision of their journalists being jailed for
going on a favorite assignment _ dogging royalty _ if the
government goes ahead with its threat.
   The journalists' union and editors' organizations also protested
that the move threatened press freedoms.
   But amid the protests and finger-pointing, there was also rueful
acknowledgment that the fiercely competitive popular tabloids
sometimes go too far.
   In recent years, incidents have included a reporter posing as a
doctor to get medical records of a dying TV personality to see if
the man had AIDS.
   Last January, a reporter and photographer for a freewheeling
weekly, Sunday Sport, barged into an intensive care ward to
interview an actor suffering from brain damage.
   In an announcement in Parliament on Thursday, the government
said it will establish a state-funded Press Tribunal headed by a
judge or senior lawyer unless the press sets up within 12 months a
new, voluntary watchdog body.
   If newspapers flout an 18-point code of ethics to be
administered by the voluntary body, the Newspaper Complaints
Commission, or it proves generally ineffective after six months,
the tougher Press Tribunal will be appointed.
   The tribunal would have powers to stop publication of offending
articles and force newspapers to pay compensation to people whose
privacy has been violated, the government said.
   Waddington said the government also plans to create three new
criminal offenses that would outlaw physical intrusion, bugging,
photographing or tape-recording on ``private property'' to obtain
personal material for publication.
   Private property would include hotel bedrooms and hospital wards.
   The moves were recommended by a panel, chaired by a Cambridge
University dean, David Calcutt, which was appointed in April 1989,
after growing complaints about press invasions of privacy.
   The opposition Labor Party, in rare accord with the Conservative
government, welcomed the ultimatum, reflecting growing impatience
with previous press promises to curb excesses.
   ``We believe in another freedom _ the right of individuals to
live in freedom and in peace,'' said Roy Hattersley, Labor's deputy
leader.
   Unlike most other Western European countries, Britain has no
right-to-privacy laws or laws against physical intrusion.
   The ultimatum culminated years of complaints about the sexy,
kiss-and-tell tabloids, purchased interviews, and foot-in-the-door
pursuits of pop stars, royalty, politicians, criminals or
little-known people suddenly in the limelight.
   The present watchdog body for Britain's 130 daily and Sunday
newspapers and 1,800 other weekly papers is a Press Council that
merely has powers to complain.
   The Association of British Editors called Waddington's ultimatum
``another turn of the screw against the free workings of the
press.''
   The 585,000-circulation tabloid, Today, headlined its report,
``Jail Editors to Protect The Royals.'' Others complained the
regulations would hamper investigative journalism.
   But several influential newspapers and press executives welcomed
the move.

   The City Commission dropped a planned welcome
resolution for Nelson Mandela on Friday and some Cuban exiles
called for demonstrations during his visit here to protest
Mandela's praise for Fidel Castro.
   Mandela is scheduled to address a labor convention in Miami
Beach on June 28 as part of his U.S. tour.
   The political furor arose over Mandela's comments Thursday on
ABC in which he thanked Castro, as well as Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan President Moammar
Gadhafi for their longtime support of the once-outlawed African
National Congress.
   Those remarks also prompted criticism Friday from American
Jewish leaders.
   The statement ``pained many, many members of the Miami
community,'' said Mayor Xavier Suarez, a Cuban-American.
   ``There was an unwilligness to analyze other struggles for
freedom,'' Suarez said. ``It was sort of `He's my ally, and my ally
can do no wrong.'''
   A proclamation welcoming Mandela and praising his struggle was
dropped because such measures are traditionally approved by
unanimous vote, and two Cuban-American commission members _ Victor
DeYurre and Miriam Alonso _ have now objected, Suarez said.
   The mayor added that he also was troubled by the comments,
although he said he strongly supports Mandela's campaign for a
non-racial democracy.
   The Miami reaction was not only on an official level. Phone
lines on Cuban talks shows lit up Friday, with almost all callers
condemning Mandela.
   ``We Cubans should go protest,'' one caller to Radio Mambi said.
``Out with Mandela _ we have enough communists here.''
   Tomas Regalado, the station's news director, said Cubans felt
Mandela was hypocritical.
   ``This guy has a double standard on human rights,'' Regalado
said. ``He wants human rights for black people in South Africa, but
he's denying human rights to the black people in Cuba.''
   Mandela said Western leaders should not assume that their
enemies are the same as the ANC's enemies. He said Castro, Arafat
and Gadhafi had been staunch supporters of the ANC at times when
the West ignored the black South African cause.
   In New York, leaders of Jewish organizations also criticized
Mandela.
   ``We believe Americans generally will be disappointed by his
notion that the terrorism and human rights violations of the
Gadhafis, Arafats and Castros of this world do not matter, as long
as they provide aid to the African National Congress,'' said Robert
K. Lifton and Henry Siegman, president and executive director,
respectively, of the American Jewish Congress.
   Albert Vorspan, senior vice president of the 840-congregation
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, stated:
   ``Nelson Mandela's statements of support for the PLO, Libya and
Cuba during his visit in New York are disappointing. His
problematic remarks have undone some of the good work accomplished
at our meeting in Geneva in clarifying issues of concern to the
Jewish community.''
   Abraham H. Foxman, another member of the Jewish group that met
with Mandela in Geneva two weeks ago, said Mandela's statements
``remain troubling and inconsistent.''
   ``Americans will continue to support Mandela's struggle against
apartheid. They are likely, however, to take issue with his remarks
which reiterated his loyalty to ... sworn enemies of the United
States and democracy,'' said Foxman, director of the
Anti-Defamation League.

<HEAD>College Literary Magazine Rejects NEA Grant In `Free Speech'
Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of Gettysburg College's
literary magazine rejected a federal arts grant Friday, saying he
believes restrictions placed on the money violate the right to
freedom of expression.
   Peter Stitt, editor of the Gettysburg Review, said new
stipulations banning ``obscene or meritless'' art result in prior
restraint.
   The stipulations were added to the National Endowment of the
Arts grants last year after a furor over federal funding of an
exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe. Some of the photos had homoxesexual
themes. The changes have brought widespread protests from artists
and their supporters.
   The Gettysburg Review publishes poetry, fiction and non-fiction
articles. It has never published anything considered obscene, Stitt
said.
   ``My decision should not be construed as support for
obscenity,'' he said. ``But, I cannot see any way for us to
determine what the endowment considers obscene unless we submit the
materials that we wish to publish to the endowment for review prior
to the publication.''
   Submitting marterial for approval, an action that could result
in prior restraint, contradicts the First Amendment right to
freedom of expression, he said.
   The NEA does not have a procedure for checking up on the
thousands of photographers, dancers, urban designers, painters and
other artists who receive federal grants each year.
   The journal received a $4,550 grant to increase its advertising
budget. Stitt said the publication had asked for the grant before
the new regulations were enacted last fall.
   Under the regulations, grant recipients were asked to swear off
art that included ``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts
and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific merit.''
   All of the more than 4,000 grant recipients this year were asked
to sign letters promising to comply with federal guidelines.
   At least two artists have declined to accept NEA grants because
of the restrictions.
   Theater producer Joseph Papp refused a $50,000 grant and dance
choreographer Bella Lewitzky declined $72,000.
   The New School for Social Research, which received a $45,000
grant to build a sculpture garden at its New York City campus,
filed a lawsuit in May, saying the guidelines were
unconstitutional. The lawsuit has not been settled.
   Congress currently is considering an Bush administration
proposal to extend the NEA program for five years without any
restrictions.
   The proposal, scheduled to be considered on the House floor in
mid-July, could face amendments that would add restrictions or
guidelines for grants, House leaders have said.

   He lived with his mother's corpse for
more than six months, but the son of an elderly woman refused to
believe she was dead, police said.
   The body of Florence V. Kowalewski, 77, was found seated in a
chair Wednesday in the house where she had lived with her
47-year-old son, police Lt. Thomas Rowan said.
   ``He was at home with his mother and denied she was dead when
police told him,'' Rowan said. ``She had been dead for more than
six months and under a year.''
   The son, whose identity was withheld, was admitted to the Erie
County Medical Center for psychiatric evaluation. Cheektowaga is a
suburb of Buffalo.
   Police were called to the house Wednesday by a social worker who
became alarmed when no one answered her knocking at the door, Rowan
said.
   An autopsy was inconclusive but the death was probably due to
natural causes, he said.
   ``Right now we have no crime and no sign of any foul play,''
Rowan said. ``It appears Mrs. Kowalewski died in her bed. Her body
was moved at least once and maybe another time in the house. It was
in an advanced stage of (putrefaction) and there was some
mummification.''
   A neighbor described the mother and son as loners and said the
son rarely ventured out, except at night.
   The son did not have a full-time job and police believe he lived
on his mother's pension and savings.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Scientists Meet on Environmental Cooperation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that the ``red phone'' linking Soviet
and U.S. leaders in case of military crisis is becoming obsolete,
the governments should establish ``green'' lines to battle
ecological problems, officials said Friday.
   Scientists and government officials approved a series of
recommendations to further communication and cooperation in
conservation and wildlife management at the U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Conference on Environmental Conservation.
   The weeklong conference of nearly 40 representatives from each
country was held at Washington and Lee University.
   Edward LaRoe, a research director for the Fish and Wildlife
Service, said the conference was the most comprehensive since the
U.S.-U.S.S.R Agreement on Cooperation in Environmental Protection
was signed in 1972.
   Delegation leaders said the increasing popularity of the
environmental movement in both countries and the prospect of a
peace dividend _ the shift from military to domestic spending _
could further environmental cooperation.
   The resolutions Friday included establishing ``green'' lines of
rapid communication between governments during environmental crises
like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and the nuclear accident
in Chernobyl.
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Mike Smith said his
agency is anticipating its largest budget ever in 1991.
   ``We believe we are going to have the level of funding necessary
to begin some of these cooperative efforts,'' Smith said.
   The idea for ``green'' lines came from the Soviet delegation
leader, Aleksei Yablokov, a zoologist and member of the natural
resources committee in the Congress of People's Deputies. The lines
would link key government leaders and experts in particular
scientific fields.
   If the countries can have a ``red'' phone for use in a potential
military crisis, ``Why not a `green' phone between the two
nations?'' Smith said.
   Other proposals were to:
   _study areas in both countries that have undergone ecological
catastrophes.
   _establish common information banks, with standardized methods
for data collection and storage.
   _increase the number, size and types of ecosystems represented
in networks of protected areas.
   _carry out wildlife inventories and monitoring activities in
both health and disturbed ecosystems.

<TEXT>
   A woman dubbed ``Lady Goetz'' for pulling an
illegal pistol and shooting a would-be mugger delivered an
impassioned speech on self-protection Thursday when she pleaded
guilty to a reduced weapons charge.
   ``I deeply regret what has happened,'' Yvesnande Bureau, a
20-year-old department store clerk, told a judge in acknowledging
that she knew carrying an unregistered gun was against the law.
   ``I was mugged in this city three times. ... When I finally used
my own gun, it was only because I was frightened. I had to protect
myself,'' she said. ``If this scenario keeps repeating itself, the
city will be out of control.''
   Ms. Bureau was arrested in March after an armed robber tried to
push his way into a car with her and her friend Theresa Jackson,
19. Ms. Bureau fired her unregistered .22-caliber pistol and fired,
grazing him in the head.
   He ran away, but a few minutes later a car pulled up to the
women's car and someone opened fire, striking Ms. Jackson in the
head. She died two days later.
   Clint Smith, 24, was arrested and charged with trying to rob the
women. He is awaiting trial, held in lieu of $75,000 bail.
   No one has been charged in Ms. Jackson's death, but Ms. Bureau
was charged with felony possession of a weapon, punishable by up to
seven years in prison.
   On Thursday, she pleaded guilty to fourth-degree weapons
possession, a misdemeanor.
   ``I find it a bit unfortunate when decent people have to resort
to illegal activity to protect themselves,'' said trial judge Luigi
R. Marano, sentencing her to four consecutive weekends in jail and
100 hours community service.
   With credit for the nearly five days she spent locked up after
her arrest, she will probably have to spend only three more days in
jail, said her lawyer, Barry Slotnick.
   After her arrest, Ms. Bureau's case elicited comparisons to that
of subway gunman Bernhard Goetz who shot four teen-agers in
December 1984.

   Rescuers freed thousands of people Friday
from buildings flattened by an earthquake in northern Iran, but
Iranian officials said at least 36,000 people died in the world's
deadliest tremor since 1976.
   Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of
hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, appealed for international
help. The government said it would welcome relief from the American
Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups even though the two
nations have no diplomatic ties.
   ``We want to be helpful without regard for our political
differences with Iran,'' said Richard Boucher, deputy State
Department spokesman in Washington.
   The magnitude of Thursday's pre-dawn disaster became more
obvious as rescuers were able to get into the region about 125
miles northwest of Tehran near the Caspian Sea to view the
destruction. Foreign-based reporters so far have been unable to get
visas to enter the country.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said
6,000 people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the
stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals.
   But IRNA reported later Friday that ``rescue workers are
becoming less optimistic. The number of those taken out alive has
dropped sharply.''
   The news agency quoted an elderly survivor as telling rescuers
in the village of Jamalabad in Zanjan province: ``If you had come
earlier, you could have saved my daughter-in-law. I was talking to
her until a few hours ago.''
   Iranian television, also monitored in Cyprus, showed scenes of
devastation, including the remains of an entire row of hillside
village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill.
   Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims.
They gently fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of
stones and earth, only his head protruding.
   The Iranian Red Crescent asked for help in providing shelter for
400,000 people left homeless by the earthquake.
   Iran's U.N. Mission in New York on Friday afternoon said that
according to the latest estimates from the region, at least 36,000
people were killed and more than 100,000 were injured.
   IRNA in its most precise figures said 25,241 were killed in
Gilan province and 3,709 in Zanjan province.
   The toll surpassed a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby
Soviet Armenia in December 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that
also killed 25,000.
   The quake's toll was the highest since July 28, 1976, when an
estimated 200,000 people were killed in China by a quake measuring
7.8-8.2 on the Richter scale.
   Farhad Shad, a spokesman for the Geophysics Center at Tehran
University, told IRNA that 140 aftershocks were registered after
the killer earthquake, which measured 7.3 to 7.7 on the Richter
scale, according to geological stations in Tehran, Edinburgh,
Scotland, and Golden, Colo.
   A scientist on Iranian television displayed a seismographic
chart of the earthquake. It showed a straight pen-trace, then a
sharp vertical jump when the pen actually jumped off the page, such
was the intensity of the quake.
   More than 3,000 tons of relief supplies were flown to the region
in 50 trips by air force transport planes, the Iranian news agency
quoted an air force commander identified only as Gen. Naderian as
saying.
   The agency said 10 C-130 transport planes and 30 Chinook
helicopters were involved in the evacuation of victims after
weather conditions improved.
   Earlier, poor visibility hampered rescue operations.
   The United States sent a message of condolence and expressed
willingness to provide humanitarian aid. Israel, which also has no
relations with Iran, did the same.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani flew to the village of Roodbar in
the heart of the region and told Iranian television that ``this
disaster is much worse than anything we have heard from the media.''
   ``Realistic casualty figures would be a lot higher than those
already announced,'' said Rafsanjani, who appealed for foreign help
to aid the victims.
   ``Everyone is helping, but with a calamity this disastrous,
nothing could be enough,'' said the president as he stood beside a
helicopter.
   In scenes shown on television, masked rescuers in white aprons
pulled dust-covered bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were
laid on blocks of ice in open trucks.
   The state-run television interviewed one middle-aged man from
Roodbar, a mountainside village in Gilan province, who said he was
sleeping when the temblor struck.
   ``It was so strong,'' he said. ``I was thrown several meters, I
ended up by the olive trees,'' outside his home. ``Then a big
boulder hit the house. The house collapsed. I lost all four of my
children.''
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said one man, Bahrouz Hakimi,
lost 27 family members in the village of Manjil, also in the heart
of the region.
   Families flooded donation centers in Tehran and handed over
fistfuls of cash to rescue committees.
   ``Whatever extra things you have at home _ medicines, clothing _
please bring them,'' one woman tearfully told the television.
   There were large piles of clothing and blankets, as well as
dozens of kerosene heaters lined up against the wall.
   The Red Crescent Society in Tehran issued an international
appeal for surgical thread, blood bags, orthopedic surgical
equipment, tents, sheets, blankets and medicine, including
antibiotics and vitamins.
   The director of Iran's Blood Transfusion Department, Dr. Ahmad
Milaniania, said there was no need for ``foreign blood,'' because
Iranians had responded well to hospital appeals for donations.
   The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva was coordinating
offers of assistance as they poured in from around the world.
   The first team of French doctors to arrive set up a center to
treat the wounded, and other nations began flying in tons of
equipment and medical supplies and hundreds of rescue workers.
   The French government announced it was sending a civil defense
team of 195 people and 18 search dogs, along with 24 tons of
equipment, on a special Air France flight Friday.
   Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries
except Israel and South Africa.
   The European Community announced in Brussels it would give $2.4
million in aid. Syria, an ally of Iran, sent a plane with 11 tons
of medicines, food and clothing.

<HEAD>Poll: Floridians Oppose `Nasty' Record Ban, Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Florida voters responding to a new poll said
it was wrong to outlaw 2 Live Crew's record and arrest the rappers
for singing sexually explicit songs.
   Fifty-three percent of the registered voters responding to the
Mason-Dixon poll disagreed with a federal court ruling that the
group's recored, ``Nasty as They Wanna Be,'' is obscene, the
pollsters announced Friday. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents
agreed with the ruling.
   In order to rule the record obscene, the court had to find it
violated community standards of decency.
   The poll, conducted for newspapers and broadcasters around the
state, was conducted last week among 627 randomly selected
registered voters. The margin of error was 4 percent.
   The poll also found 54 percent of those surveyed said it was
wrong for Broward County Sheriff's Nick Nararro to order the arrest
of band members after a concert two weeks ago, while 37 percent
supported the arrests.
   Band leader Luther Campbell was buoyed by the poll results.
   ``That's great,'' he said. ``Nobody in the United States should
be able to tell somebody else what they can listen to.''
   Navarro refused to comment on the poll results.
   ``The sheriff's really not interested in the poll,'' said
Navarro's spokesman, Al Gordon. ``He's interested in the law.''
   The pollsters also found Floridians seem to be growing tired of
the controversy. They jokingly asked if both Campbell and Navarro
should be banned from the talk-show circuit _ and one of three of
those responding said yes.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday refused to block the
execution of ``Black Widow'' killer Judi Buenoano, whose lawyers
had claimed that a malfunctioning state electric chair posed cruel
and unusual punishment.
   U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett said tests on the chair
showed the equipment ``was in good working order.''
   She extended the temporary stay of execution until 9 a.m.
Monday, and it was rescheduled for 9:01 a.m., said Jon Peck,
spokesman for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Ms. Buenoano's chief defense lawyer, Billy H. Nolas, said the
decision would be appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta.
   Ms. Buenoano, 47, known as the ``Black Widow'' killer because of
convictions for the fatal poisoning of her husband, the drowning of
her son and the attempted murder of her boyfriend, had been granted
a temporary stay of execution Thursday.
   The judge said a polyurethene sponge, since removed from the
electric chair, was what caused sparks, smoke and fire to leap from
the head of executed killer Jesse Tafero last month.
   But she said that and other equipment problems had been
corrected by the state.
   Nolas contended the defense's claim that the electric chair may
malfunction has not been resolved.
   ``We are still concerned that our client may literally be burned
at the stake,'' he said.
   Prison officials called in an independent electrician to inspect
the chair for damage, and he testified late Friday that he found no
problems with the equipment.
   ``If there had been a crack or a fault, there is no way I would
have gotten that good reading'' from his testing meter, said the
electrician, Thomas Brandies of Jacksonville.
   The state contends that Tafero received such a powerful bolt of
electricity during his execution that he did not suffer, despite
the flames and sparks.
   The Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal from
Buenoano on the same basis.
   Ms. Buenoano's lawyers also cross-examined her trial lawyer,
James Johnston, to prove he was ineffective counsel in the 1985
first-degree murder trial here. He was quizzed closely about why he
did not introduce possible mitigating circumstances to convince the
jury to sentence his client to life in prison instead of the
electric chair.
   Ms. Buenoano was sentenced to death for the fatal arsenic
poisoning of her husband, Air Force Sgt. James E. Goodyear, in
Orlando in 1971.
   She also was convicted of killing her paralyzed son, Michael
Goodyear, 19, by pushing him from a canoe in a 1980 outing and of
attempted murder in a car bombing that injured her boyfriend, John
Gentry, in 1983.
   She would be the second woman executed in the United States
since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment
in 1976. North Carolina killed Velma Barfield by lethal injection
in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend.

<TEXT>
   The president of Mills College, whose
students went on strike last month and overturned a plan to admit
male students, has resigned, the school announced Friday.
   Mary S. Metz told the school's board of trustees Thursday that
she was leaving immediately to pursue other opportunities, said
Mills spokeswoman Vickie Bates.
   Bates gave no other reason for the departure of Metz, president
of the exclusive school since 1981. Metz didn't respond to a
telephone request for comment.
   The trustees named Virginia B. Smith, former president of Vassar
College and a trustee of Mills since 1988, as acting president.
   The trustees accepted Metz's resignation with reluctance, said
F. Warren Hellman, president of the board.
   ``She has given Mills energetic, effective and visionary
leadership for the past nine years,'' he said. Metz was named
president emeritus, an honorary position, Bates said.
   The school's trustees in May announced they planned to overcome
the school's financial problems by admitting male undergraduates.
   But they backed down May 18 after students went on strike,
claiming their education would suffer if men were admitted to the
138-year-old school, one of only 94 all-women colleges nationwide.
   School officials said they could keep Mills from having to admit
men by doubling the alumnae association's annual gift and by
increasing enrollment.
   ``(Metz) feels she's leaving the college in a position of
strength,'' Bates said. ``Now the college is completely committed
to one goal, one mission, which is to remain a women's college and
increase recruiting and fundraising at the same time.''
   Metz earlier was provost and dean of faculty at Hood College in
Frederick, Md., and assistant to the chancellor at Louisiana State
University. She also taught French at both Hood and LSU.
   Mills had 777 undergraduate students and 264 graduate students
at the end of the 1989-90 school year.

<HEAD>FBI Fires Gay Agent Who Sued Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI summarily dismissed an FBI agent who
had sued the agency for attempting to fire him because of his
homosexuality, the man's lawyer said.
   Two FBI officials came to agent Frank Buttino's home Wednesday
morning and read a brief termination order from FBI headquarters,
said Buttino's lawyer, Richard Gayer.
   ``He was shocked, very upset,'' Gayer said Thursday from San
Francisco. ``He didn't think they would be gross enough to fire him
before the hearing.''
   FBI spokesman Gene Reihl in San Diego declined comment and
referred calls to spokesman Charles Steinmetz in Washington D.C.,
who was unavailable Friday.
   The FBI placed Buttino on administrative leave in September
after a 20-year career. His security clearance was revoked May 29
without explanation.
   On June 8, Buttino filed a suit in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco seeking to stop the government from firing him.
   The 45-year-old Buttino has handled counterespionage, terrorism
investigations and other sensitive cases, Gayer said.
   Gayer said the firing order ``makes the FBI look cruel and
callous. ... It's obvious from their approach that they intend to
fight tooth and nail on this. Now we have something really tangible
to fight.''
   According to the bureau's hiring policy, the agency does not
discriminate based on sexual preference.
   ``They gave no explanation why the agent's security clearance
was revoked or why he was fired,'' Gayer said. ``Just that,
suddenly, they don't trust him any more.''
   Buttino's lawsuit alleges that the FBI regularly discriminates
against gays, Gayer said.
   After the FBI learned in 1988 that Buttino was homosexual, he
provided details of his personal life to eliminate any concern he
could be blackmailed, Gayer said.
   The agent's San Diego supervisors and colleagues, with whom he
has worked for 17 years, continue to trust and respect him, Gayer
said.
   ``What Washington is saying is, `We don't trust you because
you're gay,' '' Gayer said. ``It's significant that everyone he
worked with supports him. But there are two or three people in
Washington who have never met him or spoken to him, and they are
the ones with the power to revoke his security clearance.''
   Buttino was five years away from qualifying for a full
government pension. He must regain his job within a year or he will
lose that pension, Gayer said.

   Putting aside their troubled relations with
Tehran, Britain, the United States and Israel joined nations around
the world in offering aid Friday to earthquake-devastated Iran.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in a message to his Iranian
counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, said: ``We are very saddened by the
terrible loss of life in yesterday's earthquake in Iran. ... The
government is keen to do what they can to help.''
   Britain and Iran severed diplomatic relations in March 1989
after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill
British author Salman Rushdie for his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   A member of the Iranian interests section that operates through
the Pakistan Embassy in London said the British offer was ``very
kind.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States also does not have diplomatic relations with
Iran, but the White House offered humanitarian assistance and sent
a message of condolence. The State Department said Iran indicated
it would welcome earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and
other U.S. humanitarian organizations.
   ``We want to be helpful without regard for our political
differences with Iran,'' said deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
   Israel also offered assistance. ``Israel is very sorry for the
grave natural disaster in Iran and is prepared to give the Iranians
immediate aid as it has done for various other nations,'' said
Eliza Goren, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
   Foreign Minister David Levy offered to help Iran search for
trapped quake survivors. The offer was made through the League of
the International Red Cross. Israel has had no diplomatic ties with
Iran since the Islamic revolution ousted the Shah in 1979.
   Iran reportedly said humanitarian aid would be welcomed from all
nations except South Africa and Israel.
   The family of one Westerner held hostage by pro-Iranian groups
joined in the outpouring of sympathy for Iran, which was hit by a
major earthquake Thursday that killed tens of thousands of people.
   The brother of one British hostage, Terry Waite, said he wrote
to the Iranian interests section to express ``my profound distress
and grief at the tremendous loss of life.''
   David Waite told The Associated Press he wrote ``that Terry is
someone who has great love for the Iranian people and that if he
should learn about it (the earthquake) he himself will be very
distressed.'' Terry Waite is the special envoy of Anglican Church
Archbishop Robert Runcie.
   A plane loaded with British relief supplies was scheduled to fly
to Tehran over the weekend, the government said.
   It would be joining planes, supplies and personnel rushing from
all over the world to aid the thousands of earthquake victims.
   A statement from the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva
said the most immediate needs were medicine, medical supplies and
tents. Others include canned food, blankets, clothing, vehicles and
heavy-duty equipment.
   The organization was sending two senior officials to the
stricken areas, and a special task force was established at the
Iranian president's office to coordinate relief, the United Nations
said.
   The first team of French doctors arrived Thursday, only hours
after the quake, and opened a center to treat the wounded. The
French government promised to send a civil defense team of 195
people and 18 search dogs, along with 24 tons of equipment.
   In Geneva, the International Red Cross said radio reports
received from the Red Crescent of Iran indicated that at least
400,000 were homeless in northern Iran. Red Crescent is the Islamic
equivalent of the Red Cross.
   Paer Stenbaeck, secretary-general of the League of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies, said cash contributions were arriving in
response to an appeal to members around the world. Early donors
included the governments of Sweden, Finland and Japan, he said.
Many others followed.
   Stenbaeck said the Iranians, being used to earthquakes, had ``a
remarkably effective relief operation'' and did not need blood
plasma, satellite communications equipment, sniffer dogs, used
clothing, doctors, technicians or more relief workers.
   Three thousand trained rescue workers were already deployed in
the disaster area, and the Iranian Red Crescent had its own tent
factories, food processing plants and warehouses, he said.
   Iraq, which fought Iran in the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war, was
among the first Arab nations to send a note of condolence.
   ``We are ready to provide any assistance you may require,''
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in a message to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The United Arab Emirates was the first Gulf state to send
supplies. The Soviet Union sent a rescue team.
   International Rescue Corp., a private British charity, sent a
17-member rescue team to Iran after receiving an Iranian request
for help, team coordinator Terry Price said. The team took portable
satellite communications equipment and instruments to detect
victims under rubble.
   Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in
Washington, said the organization was raising money rather than
shipping supplies, and had established a toll-free nationwide
telephone number for people wanting to make contributions.
   ``We're attempting to raise money to send to the Red Crescent
Society to help buy tents, blankets, food, medical supplies and
emergency lighting,'' he said.

<HEAD>Biologists Find Second Gray Wolf Den In Washington State</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A den of gray wolves was discovered in the
Cascade Mountains this week by biologists who howled to attract the
elusive, endangered predators.
   The den was the second found this year in Washington, the state
Department of Wildlife said Friday.
   The presence of the den was indicated when state and federal
biologists spotted two wolf pups near the Pasayten Wilderness Area
in the Okanogan National Forest, said Ed Isenson, a state wildlife
spokesman.
   ``To say we're excited is an understatement,'' he said. ``Two
wolf dens in Washington after their eradication decades ago is
truly a happy event for everybody.''
   Gray wolves have been been listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service since 1967 in every state but Minnesota and
Alaska.
   Sightings of adult gray wolves have been reported off and on for
years in Washington state the most recent 15 years ago. But
breeding wolves have been unknown in Washington since the turn of
the century, making the recent discoveries remarkable, said state
endangered species specialist Harriet Allen.
   State and federal biologists discovered the second den Monday
during a ``howling survey,'' in which biologists emulate wolf calls
and hope for an answer.
   Isenson said the biologists saw two wolf pups cross in front of
their headlights shortly after the officials had howled.
   On May 23, biologists confirmed the existence of a wolf den in
the Hozomeen area of the Ross Lake National Recreation area,
roughly 40 miles northwest of the second discovery.
   Biologists believe the breeding wolves in Washington came from
nearby British Columbia, Isenson said.

   Nancy Sununu, wife of White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, said Thursday she decided against running for
Congress because she likes her job too much and her son is too
young.
   ``In another couple of years, I think it would have been

   Mrs. Sununu, who is director of special projects for the
Republican Governors Association, said Thursday that she didn't
make up her mind until the June 15 deadline to file. She said she
had considered flying to New Hampshire from Nebraska to file the
necessary papers.
   ``I really love my job and it was a tough decision for me to
decide whether to give up something I really like ... as opposed to
something I'm not really sure about,'' she said.

<HEAD>Human Rights Abuses Spur Vote To Cut Off Aid to Zaire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee on Thursday voted to cut off
military aid for Zaire to protest human rights abuses, President
Mobutu Sese Seko's alleged corruption and his failure to carry out
promised political reforms.
   The decision by the House Appropriations Committee is expected
to be upheld by the full House when the foreign aid bill reaches
the floor next week.
   The committee ``does not believe that U.S. interests in Zaire
should override our concerns with respect to corruption and human
rights abuses,'' the bill said.
   The committee ``seriously questions the administration's
insistence on providing U.S. taxpayers' dollars to a government
whose head of state has reportedly amassed a personal fortune of as
much as $6 million while Zaire remains a very poor country,'' it
said.
   U.S. military aid to Zaire this year was $4 million. In
addition, the United States provided almost $50 million in food and
development assistance.
   A group of lawmakers is preparing a letter to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III asking that all U.S. development aid be
channeled through private voluntary organizations rather than
through the government of Zaire.
   The letter also criticizes the ``backward steps'' taken by
Mobutu since he pledged last April to lift a ban on opposition
parties and allow free elections, said a source familiar with the
letter.
   Some members of Congress have accused the Bush administration of
ignoring Mobutu's human rights abuses because of his support for
U.S. policy in Africa. In recent years Mobutu has played an
important role by serving as a conduit for U.S. arms to the rebels
fighting the Soviet-backed government of Angola.
   The administration on Thursday praised a report by an inquiry
commission in Zaire for bringing to light important facts about a
May 11 military raid against university students at Lubumubashi
University.
   The panel said it could not determine how many students were
killed when masked soldiers launched the raid in revenge for the
beating of three students who were government informers. Differing
reports put the death toll between 50 and 150.
   The panel said the governor of Shaba Province authorized the
attack, but he remains free and no one has been charged in the
attack.
   The United States has not condemned the incident, initially
saying it could not confirm reports of a massacre and subsequently
saying its embassy had found out that one or two students were
killed.
   Belgium decided to freeze all cooperation with its former colony
once it learned of the killings last month. The Belgian government
welcomed the commission's report but said it would not resume
cooperation with Zaire pending government action on the findings of
the report.

   A cooperative nutrition education program is
being started in public housing projects in eight cities, the
government said Thursday.
   The program will begin this summer and early fall, said
officials of the departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban
Development. A private partner in the project is Kraft General
Foods Foundation.
   Officials said the project ``will unite the urban education
experience and university research base'' of the Agriculture
Department's Extension Service, HUD's facilities, public housing
authorities and tenant associations, and support services and
financial aid from Kraft General Foods.
   The eight selected cities and their designated public housing
developments are:
   Philadelphia, Pa., Norris; Decatur, Ga., Swanton Heights;
Washington, D.C., Lincoln Heights; Houston, Texas, Cuney Homes; New
York, N.Y., Ingersoll-Whitman; Tampa, Fla., Robles Park; Chicago,
Ill., Robert Taylor Homes; and Los Angeles, Calif., Imperial Courts.

<HEAD>Compromise May Move Oil Spill Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A compromise over limiting liability in oil
spills may help move a bill on that issue that has been beached in
Congress, House members said on Thursday.
   A compromise offered by Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., would allow
a five-year trial period to see if international standards of
liability are adequate or can be changed.
   ``I think it's a sound approach. It goes more than halfway,''
said Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas.
   The House has approved letting international standards guide how
much responsibility an oil or shipping company must take for a
spill. The Senate version of the bill lets states set those
standards. Nineteen states have laws requiring companies to assume
unlimited liability for damage from a spill.
   ``This compromise will allow us to enact the complete oil spill
legislation,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska.
   The congressmen, during a hearing by the Coast Guard and
navigation subcommittee of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee on response to recent oil spills, urged the Senate to
agree to Studds' resolution of liability limits, the main issue
tying up the bill's passage.
   Studds proposed a trial period of up to five years for the less
stringent international protocols. During that time, the United
States would push to strengthen international liability limits. If
they couldn't be strengthened, the United States would return to
its own standards.

<TEXT>
   ``Maids of Honor'' by Joan Casademont tackles
the same area as Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winner, ``Crimes of
the Heart.''
   ``Maids of Honor,'' too, is a play about zany, mixed-up sisters.
But the play is more of a crime than a winner. Despite verbiage,
it's simplistic. It opened Thursday night at the WPA Theater.
   Three excellent actresses play the sisters. Elizabeth McGovern,
veteran of the films ``Ordinary People'' and ``Ragtime,'' made the
most of Izzy Bowlin, the impulsive cub reporter on a Boston
newspaper. Kyra Sedgwick, who had her Broadway debut in ``Ah,
Wilderness!'' was the calm, introverted sculptor Annie. Laila
Robins, who made her Broadway debut in ``The Real Thing,'' played
the bride, Monica.
   The writing is overheated, with thickets of words growing from a
rather small root. The Bowlin parents are dead. When alive,
alcoholic Dad beat Mom and made the daughters feel unlovable. They
still do.
   Monica says she's 33, a famous TV talk show host and has been to
seven therapists. She talks like an adolescent, breaking up with
Roger, about to marry wealthy, dishonest inside-trader Chuck,
pregnant, sure both men find her unlovable and will hit her any
minute.
   The bridesmaid sisters find themselves unlovable, too, and mess
up every relationship from fear of being abused.
   Despite good performances, the Bowlin sisters become boring.
   Three male actors are less well cast.
   The wedding dress and bridesmaids' dresses are lovely and the
set, of a kitchen in Marblehead, Mass., is effective. Mimi Maxmen
designed costumes and Edward T. Gianfrancesco designed the set. Max
Mayer directed.
   Casademont, a 1988 graduate of the Yale School of Drama, is
making her professional debut as a playwright.

   A bomb exploded on a military base northwest of
London Thursday, but a security guard had spotted a suspicious
rucksack and the base and a nearby senior citizens' home were
evacuated shortly before the blast.
   No injuries were reported from the blast at the Royal Air
Force's 250-acre administrative base, Stanmore Park, police said.
   On Wednesday night, postal workers intercepted letter bombs
addressed to the government minister in charge of Welsh affairs and
to a Conservative parliamentarian who represents a Welsh
contituency.
   The incidents at the base and in London appeared to be unrelated.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion at the military
base, but suspicion fell on the Irish Republican Army.
   ``We can't say who was responsible at this stage, but it looks
as if the IRA are the main suspects,'' said Detective Chief
Superintendent Derek Willison, second-in-command of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad.
   Two men driving in the area after the explosion were picked up
and questioned about the blast, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.
They were later released without charge.
   Ministry of Defense officials were investigating the attack
while police forensic teams and anti-terrorist officers searched
the base. Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad was called in to
look for possible links with other recent attacks on military
personnel.
   There have been at least eight attacks on military personnel or
facilities in Britain since February. They are blamed on the IRA,
which is seeking to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   A civilian security guard on routine patrol found a suspicious
looking blue rucksack between a perimeter fence and an
administrative building shortly after 9 a.m., police said. He then
called an inspector from the Harrow Police.
   The base, which contains living quarters for 40 air force
officers and their families, and a nearby home for about 30 elderly
people were evacuated, police said.
   An explosives expert was called, but the bomb exploded around
9:40 a.m. before he arrived on the scene.
   A police spokesman credited the quick evacuation with saving
lives.
   ``They would have all been within the area of the bomb if they
had not been evacuated,'' he said of the elderly people.
   Wing Commander Simon Appleton said there had been ``an apparent
breach of perimeter security at the base.''
   Willison said there was an outside chance that the bombers threw
the explosive device over the 6{-foot wooden perimeter fence topped
by barbed wire that surrounds the base.
   In the other bomb incident, investigators were looking into the
possibility the two letter bombs had been sent by Welsh extremists,
police said Thursday. No group claimed responsibility for the
incendiary devices, a Welsh police spokesman said.
   The letter bomb addressed to Welsh Secretary David Hunt was
intercepted Wednesday night by workers in the Westminster Palace
mail room.
   A second letter bomb sent to Nicholas Bennett, a Conservative
member of Parliament, also was intercepted by workers in the mail
room at the House of Commons on Wednesday night.
   Bennett accused the Welsh organization Sons of Glendower of
sending it. He said he had been targeted because he represented a
Welsh constituency.
   Police were investigating two other letter bombs sent Wednesday,
one of which slightly injured an office worker at a Welsh boat yard.
   The other, sent to a restaurant in Dolgellau, Wales, failed to
go off and was handed over to police.
   Welsh nationalist extremists have waged a 10-year arson campaign
aimed primarily at English-owned businesses and properties.

   Scientists conducted the second nuclear
test in eight days Thursday, detonating a weapon deep beneath the
surface of the Nevada Test Site.
   The Department of Energy said the explosion appeared to be as
success.
   ``It was just a routine test,'' DOE spokesman Jim Boyer said.
   The explosion, which was not announced in advance, had a yield
of less than 20 kilotons. The DOE classifies its tests as either
less than 20 kilotons or between 20 and 150 kilotons.
   The blast registered a 4.1 on the Richter Scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   It followed a June 13 nuclear detonation that shook highrise
buildings in the Las Vegas area and registered 5.6 on the Richter
Scale.
   The latest test was the third announced this year by the DOE.
Last year, a total of 12 nuclear detonations were announced.
   The test was the 702nd since testing began at the Nevada site in
1951.

   The Illinois House rejected a proposal
Thursday to push the 1994 Illinois primary back from March to
September.
   Supporters said the change would cut campaign costs and boost
voter interest by shortening the election season. Opponents
complained it wouldn't leave enough time between elections.
   Under the proposal, sponsored by Rep. James DeLeo, D-Chicago,
the 1994 primary would be held on the Tuesday after the second
Monday in September.
   The primary now is held on the third Tuesday in March. The
general election is on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November.
   The Senate-approved bill was defeated 71-37 in the House.
   ``Other states hold September primaries,'' said Rep. Peg
Breslin, D-Ottawa, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic
nomination for state treasurer. ``It's imperative that we shorten
the campaign season.''
   In 1988, 15 states and the District of Columbia held September
primaries. Only four other states _ Arkansas, Maryland, Mississippi
and Texas _ held primaries in March.
   Rep. Grace Mary Stern, D-Highland Park, argued that holding the
primary in September wouldn't leave enough time to mail absentee
ballots.
   Similar legislation has been considered almost annually by the
General Assembly for the past 12 years.
   This year's bill was sponsored by Senate President Philip Rock,
D-Oak Park, who said it would reduce the cost of campaigning and
increase voter interest.

   Authorities searching through debris
Thursday at a dam 25 miles downstream on the Ohio River found the
23rd victim of the flash floods that swept through this Appalachian
hamlet last week.
   The victim, whose sex and identity were not immediately
determined, was found at the series of locks at the dam at
Hannibal, said Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
   Vogt said he didn't know if the victim was on a list of 11
people missing since the June 14 flood. At least four of the people
listed as still missing were known to have been in the area before
the flood, he said. Authorities were unsure about the other seven.
   Engineers planned to use cranes mounted on three barges to
remove debris backed up at the dam, said Steve Wright, a U.S. Army
Corps of Engineer spokesman.
   The debris mostly consists of lumber from houses and parts of
trees that were washed down the Wegee and Pipe creeks the night of
the flood.

   A 32-year-old man set himself on fire in
a city east of Sofia on Thursday after reading a statement alleging
fraud in Bulgaria's recent elections, the official BTA news agency
said.
   The man was rushed to a hospital in Stara Zagroa, about 150
miles east of Sofia, the capital, the news agency said.
   State radio earlier identified the man as a student. But BTA
said he was unemployed, had three criminal convictions, including
one for rape, and was under psychiatric supervision because he had
previously tried three times to commit suicide.
   The news agency said the man set himself on fire afte reading a
statement about alleged election irregularities to a group of
protesters.
   In Sofia, meanwhile, four students at Kliment Ohridski
University were in their 10th day of a hunger strike, and about 100
students were staging a sit-in protest.
   In order to dramatize their protest, some students experienced
in mountain climbing began a ``suspension strike'' Wednesday,
dangling on ropes attached to the university's roof.
   Initially the students protested what they claimed was a ``news
blackout'' and alleged manipulation of Bulgaria's national
elections held on the past two Sundays. In the vote, the former
Communist Party, which has renamed itself the Socialist Party, won
211 seats in the 400-seat Parliament.
   Now the students also demand the resignation of TV director
Pavel Pisarev and an independent investigation into whether
President Petar Mladenov urged the use of tanks against
demonstrators in December.
   The pro-democracy demonstrations led eventually to the ouster of
the hard-line government of Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov.

   Tropical storm Ofelia pounded
northern Luzon island Friday with heavy rains and winds of up to 68
miles per hour. At least five people died in landslides, officials
reported.
   Forecasters said the storm roared ashore early Friday on the
east coast of Cagayan province, about 130 miles north of Manila,
and was expected to cross the mountains of northern Luzon during
the day.
   Storm warnings were raised over 13 Luzon provinces, and small
craft were warned to remain in port. Residents of the affected
provinces were told to be on alert for landslides and flooding.
   The Office of Civil Defense said a 60-year-old man and a child
were killed in a landslide early Friday in the northwestern
province of La Union.
   Three children died and six other people were injured when mud
and debris lossened by heavy rains crashed down on their shanty
dwellings Thursday in the Manila suburb of Pasig, police and Red
Cross officials reported.
   The Canadian embassy said the storm delayed the arrival of a
Canadian warship, the HMCS Provider, due in Manila Friday with 88
Vietnamese refugees picked up in the South China Sea.
   Officials reported flooding and landslides elsewhere in northern
Luzon. Complete reports were unavailable because of poor
communications.
   Traditionally, most casualties in Philippine typhoons are not
caused by high winds but by flooding and landslides because rampant
logging, much of it illegal, has bared huge tracts in the mountains.
   About 20 tropical storms or typhoons strike the Philippines
yearly.

   Lawmakers who defeated a proposed
constitutional amendment against burning the American flag are
bracing for a fierce fight on the campaign trail but say they sense
a change of heart among many voters.
   ``Something that folks loathe almost as much as flag burners is
politicians who demagogue, who wrap themselves in the flag for some
partisan votes,'' Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., said after the measure
failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority Thursday.
   Democratic lawmakers who voted against it told reporters they
detected a change among voters and said their mail is no longer
running so heavily in favor of the amendment.
   The House voted 254-177 for the measure, which President Bush
had been pressing since June 11, when the Supreme Court threw out
the 1989 Flag Protection Act as unconstitutional.

   Democrats, unable to override President Bush's
veto of a bill to let federal workers join political campaigns, now
want to extend the ban to Bush's Cabinet and hundreds of other
presidential appointees.
   ``What's good for the goose is good for the gander,'' Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., said in introducing the new bill Thursday. Earlier,
the Senate failed by two votes to override Bush' veto of the
legislation to broaden federal workers' political rights.
   Pryor's new bill would extend the 1939 Hatch Act's ban on
federal workers' political activities to the more than 350
employees on the White House payroll and another 600 presidential
appointees.
   In vetoing the earlier bill Friday, Bush said that allowing
federal workers to participate in campaigns ``would inevitably lead
to repoliticizing the federal work force'' and ``destroy its
essential political neutrality.''

   ``It should result in a much fairer system to applicants for

   The list, previously estimated by immigration lawyers to have

<HEAD>Poverty and Pollution in Overcrowded Tehran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital of Iran, jammed with poor
peasants hunting jobs that aren't there, has become a morass of
poverty and pollution.
   Its population has doubled to 8 million since the Islamic
revolution of 1979, swollen by a birth rate of 3.5 percent a year
and migration from the countryside. That is about one-seventh of
the national population, 55 million.
   ``Tehran and other over-populated cities have expanded so much
that a remedy has to be found,'' the daily newspaper Abrar
declared. ``The problems are so complex that it seems even the most
skilled planners are at a loss to find a workable program.''
   Beyond the 8 million officially counted, Tehran has a floating
population estimated at 2 million, most of them in shantytowns on
its southern edge. Those squalid slums were the bedrock of support
for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died a year ago.
   In the park-studded northern suburbs, on the lower slopes of the
Alborz Mountains overlooking the city, wealthy Iranians still live
comfortably in their mansions and earn millions from real estate.
   Housing is in short supply, power cuts are frequent and there is
no piped sewerage system. Drug abuse is rife despite a nationwide
crackdown.
   Drinking water is becoming scarce and authorities speak of
rationing. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Tehran is
``the most polluted city in the world.''
   Tehran's 1.5 million motor vehicles clog the streets in a
single, vast traffic jam and the city is covered by choking smog.
   It may take an hour to travel five miles in central Tehran.
These days, newspapers call Tehran traffic ``the national enemy''
instead of Iraq, with which Iran was at war for eight years until
August 1988.
   Resalat, another daily, said in May that city buses are stuck in
traffic jams for so long they burn 22 gallons of gas on a 30-mile
route. It estimated Tehran residents spent 1.2 billion hours a year
in traffic jams.
   On some days, the state radio advises old people to stay indoors
because of the polluted air and warns mothers not to take young
children out.
   Officials acknowledge planning has become a nightmare. A subway
project is stalled, although President Hashemi Rafsanjani ordered
it speeded up.
   The first 7-mile section, linking Mohseni Square to Imam
Khomeini Square, was supposed to open in December. It didn't.
   ``We've been hearing about this metro (subway) since we were
kids,'' a resident said. ``Now we're grown up and they're still
just talking about it.'' A global survey published in May said
Tehran was the world's most expensive city in dollar terms.
   The study by Corporate Resources Group of Geneva based its
findings on prices of items ranging from food to leisure. If it had
included housing costs, Tehran's numbers would have been even
higher.
   A midtown apartment of about 325 square feet costs 200,000 rials
a month ($2,857 at the official rate of exchange) to rent, plus a
security deposit of 5 million rials ($71,428), Resalat reported.
   ``A civil servant, with several years' service, receives a
monthly salary of 80,000 rials ($1,142). Assuming he manages to
save 30,000 rials a month, he can save 360,000 rials a year,'' the
paper said. ``He would have to work for a century to be able to
afford to buy a suitable house!''
   The price of eggs has doubled in a year and meat costs $27 a
kilogram _ 2.2 pounds. Trousers that cost $100 a year ago now sell
for $157. A Peykan sedan, based on the old British Hillman, costs
$100,000.
   Residents of Tehran say they can barely survive on average
monthly pay of 70,000 rials, about $1,000 at the official rate.
   ``I have to have two jobs that bring in a total of 100,000
rials,'' said Ali, a 42-year-old civil servant who moonlights as a
taxi driver.
   Every disaster area has its share of people who do well, and
Tehran is no exception. Expensive restaurants are crowded and
grocery stores selling at black market prices _ 10 times normal
rates _ are well-supplied with goods and customers.
   In government-run stores, where ordinary housewives spend hours
in line, the shelves are bare.

<HEAD>`P.O.V.' Documentary Series Starts Strong Third Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three women convicted of crimes against the
state are put in an underground prison.
   They're strip-searched daily, isolated from other inmates, and
kept under 24-hour surveillance by guards and video cameras, even
in the shower. Everything they do, including their conversations,
is logged by their jailers.
   This isn't the gulag, but a federal prison. And it isn't
fiction, but a documentary film, ``Through the Wire,'' airing
Tuesday night to open the third season of ``P.O.V.,'' the
independent filmmakers' series on PBS.
   ``Through the Wire'' is typical of the kinds of risk-taking,
unconventional documentaries offered in the 12-week run of
``P.O.V.'' _ the cinematic abbreviation for ``point of view.''
   The film examines the High Security Unit of the federal prison
at Lexington, Ky., which was condemned as a sensory deprivation
tank for U.S. political prisoners almost from the day it opened in
1986.
   The women's cells get virtually no natural light or ventilation.
Their visiting rights, correspondence and reading matter are
severely limited. They are barred from training, rehabilitation or
recreation programs.
   Psychologists call the technique ``small group isolation.'' It
makes prisoners easier to manage. It is scary to think about it
being used against people convicted of politically motivated crimes.
   Next week's ``P.O.V.'' is just as unconventional.
``Metamorphosis: Man into Woman'' follows two years in the life of
Gary, a man who suffers from ``gender dysphoria,'' the conviction
that he is a woman trapped in a man's body.
   ``Metamorphosis'' follows Gary as he undergoes preliminary
plastic surgery, therapy and other, subtler processes he must go
through to live as a woman and qualify for ``sex reassignment''
surgery.
   It's a subdued and sympathetic portrait of a person braving a
profound transformation. It's engrossing to watch Gary (and his
friends and co-workers) cope with his struggle to become ``Gaby.''
   In ``Through the Wire,'' U.S. Bureau of Prisons officials
contend the high-security unit is not to punish or brainwash the
women, but because they ``may be subject to rescue attempts by
outside groups.''
   The women are:
   _Susan Rosenberg, indicted in the 1983 bombing of the U.S.
Capitol, serving 58 years for possession of weapons and explosives,
with recommendation against parole;
   _Alejandrina Torres of the FALN Puerto Rican independence
movement, serving 35 years for seditious conspiracy to bomb a U.S.
military installation, with recommendation against parole;
   _Sylvia Baraldini, serving 43 years for conspiracy and
racketeering in aiding and abetting the bloody 1981 Brink's armored
car robbery in Nyack, N.Y.
   ``Through the Wire,'' produced, directed and co-written by Nina
Rosenblum, has weaknesses, including the assertion that the women's
crimes were ``non-violent'' when in fact they conspired in or
furthered very violent acts indeed.
   There's also a jarringly unnecessary ``simulation'' of male
guards at surveillance monitors watching one woman pacing back and
forth, and another women showering with her back to the camera. We
got the idea without it.
   And there are montages of home movies and still photos showing
the women in their childhoods and pre-radical days. It suggests the
obvious: That even cute, well-adjusted kids from nice families can
become dedicated revolutionaries.
   And the film finds no irony in its portrayal of revolutionaries
who attack a government they view as fundamentally evil, break its
laws _ and then complain that the state isn't playing by the rules
in the way it punishes them.
   Even so, it becomes obvious in the course of the film that these
women are suffering in a punishing, oppressive environment.
Rosenberg especially seems to decline physically and emotionally.
None of them flourishes.
   Eventually, the women sue the Bureau of Prisons. In July 1988,
U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker orders that Rosenberg and
Baraldini be moved in with other inmates. He forbids the
consideration of ``past political associations or personal
political beliefs'' in deciding inmate transfers.
   He does not find that the unit's conditions unconstitutionally
cruel, but says the prisoners' treatment ``skirted elemental
standards of human decency.''
   ``Through the Wire'' concludes with a few ominous notes:
   Parker's ruling subsequently was overruled by an appeals court.
   The Lexington unit was closed, but the Bureau of Prisons opened
a new high-security prison in Marianna, Fla., in September 1988.
   And there are 16 prisons with similar high-security units
currently under construction or in planning in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Pat Geiger, known around town as
``the Elvis Lady,'' has spent the past seven years keeping Elvis
Presley alive.
   Elvis the postage stamp, that is.
   From the kitchen table of her tidy, comfortable home on Route
10, Geiger runs the ``Elvis Postage Stamp Campaign.'' Her goal is
to convince the U.S. Postal Service to give ``The King'' its stamp
of approval.
   ``Without question, Elvis Presley is the perfect subject for a
U.S. commemorative postage stamp,'' Geiger said. ``He was and, even
though he left us 13 years ago, continues to be one of this
country's greatest goodwill ambassadors.''
   Her devotion may pay off. A Postal Service official says Elvis
is, indeed, still alive _ in a postal sense.
   ``There's a very good chance that sometime in the future there
will be an Elvis stamp,'' said Frank Thomas, a Postal Service
marketing specialist in Washington, D.C. ``Personally, I think
there will be.''
   The major obstacle for a Presley postage stamp is ``concern over
the lifestyle issue,'' Thomas said. The Postal Service has received
mail complaining that honoring a known drug abuser ``sends a bad
message'' to America's youth, he said.
   But Geiger scoffs at that notion, pointing to other stamp
subjects with controversial private lives. Presley stamps already
have been issued in at least seven countries, including West
Germany, she said.
   Since beginning her campaign in 1983, Geiger said she has gone
through five postmasters general and is now on her sixth, Anthony
Frank.
   Frank reportedly said soon after taking office that he supports
an Elvis stamp. But after the ensuing outcry over Presley's
well-documented drug abuse _ the King died of an overdose in 1977 _
Frank retreated and said the issue requires further review.
   His wavering prompted Geiger to publicly call him a ``wimp.''
   It also renewed her determination to honor the man she credits
with changing her life.
   ``I will not give up until either Elvis gets his stamp or I die,
whichever comes first,'' the 70-year-old great-grandmother said
over a lunchtime beer.
   To understand the extent of Geiger's passion for Presley, one
must visit her house. It is wall-to-wall _ and floor-to-ceiling _
Elvis. Posters line every wall, most highlighting Presley's 1970s
jumpsuit phase.
   Bookcases are stuffed with Presley tomes, both reverential and
scandalous. Shelves burst with videocassettes of Presley movies,
and photo albums hold thousands of pictures. That's not including
her records and tapes.
   The first Presley picture Geiger bought, a black-and-white shot
taken at a 1968 press conference, will be buried with her, she vows.
   ``Pictures are my addiction,'' Geiger said, then adds, ``Pardon
me, Evis, for using that word.''
   Presleymania came late in Geiger's life. Although her older son
dressed in pink and black in the 1950s to emulate Presley, Geiger
did not convert until a 1968 TV show known as the ``Comeback
Special.''
   ``I looked at that man in that black leather suit and said
`Phew!,''' Geiger said. ``I sat in that chair and said, `Nobody is
that good looking.' It was kind of sudden. I was never the same
after that night.''
   The postage stamp entered her life in 1983, when a fellow
Presley fan mentioned the idea. After some investigating, Geiger
learned ordinary citizens are not eligible for stamp consideration
until 10 years after their deaths.
   So Geiger spent the next several years laying the groundwork for
her big 1987 push.
   ``I thought it would be a simple thing,'' she said. ``Boy, was I
naive.''
   Postal Service officials have come to know Geiger well, Thomas
said. She is, in fact, one of their best customers, firing off
letters to anybody connected with the agency.
   ``You name `em, I've written to 'em,'' she said, waving a wrist
adorned with an Elvis Presley watch.
   Commemorative postage stamps are nominated by the 15-member
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which meets every two months,
and then must be approved by the postmaster general, Thomas said.
   Although Presley has been eligible for three years, he still has
not been chosen for the honor. Does this mean Elvis _ the stamp _
is dead?
   ``No, not at all,'' Thomas said.
   The committee might include Presley in a stamp series on
American musicians, but that doesn't sit well with Geiger.
   ``Elvis was one of a kind! There will never be another!'' she
said. ``He does not fit into a group!''
   The committee will announce next year's commemorative stamps
within a month, Thomas said.
   ``If they don't announce it, that doesn't mean it won't show up
in 1991,'' he said. ``The fact that they're spending so much time
on the subject is a positive sign.''
   Meanwhile, Geiger waits impatiently and spends her days mostly
on Presley-related matters. There are the constant letters from
supporters around the world, the radio appearances, the newspaper
interviews.
   ``How did I get here? I absolutely do not know,'' she said.
``Next to my children, he's the most important person in my life. I
don't know what I'd do if there wasn't an Elvis.''

<DATELINE>UNITY PLANTATION, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using a farm machine like a giant
mixing spoon, Don Wilkinson whips up a batch of sewage sludge,
sawdust and paper-mill waste, carefully protecting his recipe for
garden feed and fill.
   ``It's hard to get the formula. So we don't let it out,''
Wilkinson said, after climbing down a monstrous device that has
just chewed up a 100-yard-long pile of the reeking, black
concoction.
   Wilkinson is chief operator at the Hawk Ridge Compost Facility,
which turns organic waste into products sold to contractors and
nurseries.
   It's also hoping to turn a profit before long. After only six
months, the facility already is paying its costs and looking
forward to making money on its landscaping and garden supplements,
which are made with industrial and municipal sludges long dismissed
as useless.
   ``All we're doing is speeding up nature's own work,'' said Jamie
Ecker, acting manager of Hawk Ridge.
   But the facility is a pioneer in what is widely seen as an
industry of the future. Not only does it recycle materials that
would otherwise be dumped in landfills, but it provides evidence
that caring for the environment doesn't always have to cost money.
   ``The market for these kinds of recycled materials will take off
and enhance our ability to make money on the venture,'' said
William Ginn, president of the Yarmouth-based Resource Conservation
Services Inc., which owns Hawk Ridge and is involved in a variety
of recycling enterprises.
   ``We think composting is going to be one of the major
solid-waste solutions,'' Ginn said.
   Each week, Hawk Ridge accepts 25 dumptruck loads of dried sewage
sludge from nearly a dozen communities, along with six tractor
trailers of sawdust and 10 dumptruck loads of paper-mill waste.
   Hawk Ridge is paid to take the sludge and mill waste, but it
buys the sawdust, which is becoming increasingly scarce as more
paper mills burn it for energy.
   Wilkinson and his assistant, Doug Knowlton, make a new batch of
compost by taking a base of the old stuff, adding paper-mill
sludge, a layer of sawdust as a bulking agent, and sewage sludge.
   Once the mixture reaches the crucial 131-degree temperature,
it's turned by steel teeth protruding from huge rollers on a
custom-designed machine, which is driven over the piles every day
for 15 days.
   The heat resulting from bio-chemical reactions kills
disease-causing bacteria in the compost heaps.
   While the process seems as simple as spreading manure, Ecker
said it took time to develop a mixing and curing formula that
results in a safe, odorless and commercially viable product using
readily available wastes.
   The process is even tracked by computer to make sure each batch
of compost is made according to ``recipe,'' said Wilkinson.
   Nora Goldstein, executive editor of Biocycle magazine, a journal
of waste recycling, said she knows of no other facility that
accepts such a wide assortment of wastes for composting.
   She also said it is one of few that is privately owned. A number
of municipalities have their own sludge facilities and yard-waste
sites.
   Since it opened in March, Hawk Ridge has turned out 6,000 cubic
yards of composted material, Ecker said. Its commercial mix is used
for such projects as landfill closings and highway and industrial
park landscaping.
   A ``homeowners' mix,'' as Ecker calls it, is made without
paper-mill sludge, which may contain tiny amounts of dioxin. That
ensures it is completely safe for gardens.
   Ecker said the company is still in the start-up phase. ``We're
not expecting to burn up the mortgage right away,'' he said.
``After all, no one has done this before on this kind of scale.''
   But the possibilities appear endless. Hawk Ridge will be
processing food and paper wastes from fast food restaurants in New
Hampshire in July to see if composting is cheaper for them than
other means of disposal, Ecker said.
   The facility is composting food wastes from a Maine processor,
and may run trials of old supermarket produce.
   And an experiment mixing paper plates with sewage sludge ``was a
huge success,'' said Wilkinson. ``It degraded nice.''

<HEAD>Housing Shortage Reveals Dark Side of City of Light</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not far from Satan's Alley and a dead-end street
called God, 48 families live in a public square. They are victims
of a war on squatters waged by a city of plenty with little room
for its poor.
   Since March 15, when a winter moratorium on evictions ended,
riot police arriving before dawn have cleared dozens of buildings.
   The evictions inspire denunciations, demonstrations and charges
that the city of Paris, where housing prices are soaring, is trying
to push the poor out of town.
   ``We're miserable here because we have nothing,'' said Assa Kan,
a 30-year-old woman from Mali with six children. They are among 150
people who have lived under tents since May 2 in the Place de la
Reunion.
   ``At night, it's really cold,'' she said, caressing the chapped
cheeks of her 4-month-old daughter. ``All the children are sick.''
   Hers is the largest of three camps set up by squatters or
renters turned out of condemned buildings. Nine families camp at
the foot of Sacre Coeur, the Montmartre basilica, and six live
outside a city government office.
   In announcing the spring offensive, Paris officials said
squatting had reached ``inadmissible'' proportions.
   ``The city is duty-bound to solve this problem'' and evictions
are ``the only way to stop the multiplication of squatters,'' said
Jean Tiberi, deputy to Mayor Jacques Chirac.
   Within days, 300 people were homeless, nearly half of them
children.
   ``These people had a right to squat,'' said Abbe Pierre, a
bearded Roman Catholic cleric who is France's premier champion of
the needy. ``When a man is hungry, he has the right to take bread
from the baker.''
   Abbe Pierre's humanitarian organization, the Emmaus Community,
provided tents for those evicted.
   A siege mentality prevails in the Place de la Reunion, which is
ringed with rosebushes and dotted with orange and blue tents.
   Amenities consist of one water spigot, three portable toilets
like those used at construction sites, and intermittent lighting at
night via an extension cord from a nearby cafe. One tent serves as
a kitchen.
   Mrs. Kan and others said they would remain until the city
provided a suitable alternative.
   ``We are confronted with the unacceptable,'' Bertrand Main,
deputy chief of the League of Human Rights, told reporters.
``Demands for rehousing are met with a wall of silence,
incomprehension and, sometimes, contempt.''
   Paris proposed temporary housing for the evicted in buildings
scheduled for demolition in St. Denis, a poor northern suburb.
Officials there objected.
   ``We don't have a money problem in Paris; we have a problem of
land,'' Tiberi, the deputy mayor, said in explaining the housing
shortage on French radio.
   ``For moral reasons ... we cannot accept the principle of
rehousing squatters,'' who rob legal occupants of apartment space,
he said.
   At a news conference, Abbe Pierre said: ``It is a crime to
refuse lodging in a city like Paris, where several thousand
apartments are vacant.''
   The Committee Against Poor Housing, a protest group that finds
vacant buildings for squatters, claims there are 3,000 to 4,000
vacant, government-subsidized Moderate Rent Housing units around
Paris. The city denies it.
   Officials say the number of buildings occupied by squatters,
most of them Africans, has grown from 36 to 187 in three years and
41 of the buildins are subsidized units, which have a waiting list
of 50,000.
   Mayor Chirac said in a letter to Abbe Pierre, made public June
20, that rehousing evicted squatters would be a ``profound
injustice'' to people on the waiting list. ``Paris is a city with
heart,'' he said, ``but ... neither the capital nor the Paris
region can take in all the misery of the world.''
   Critics claim the city is being transformed into a ghetto for
the elite.
   President Francois Mitterrand denounced those ``who enrich
themselves while sleeping'' because they own ``a good piece of land
or a nice apartment.''
   Prices have risen so quickly, he said, ``that they are starting
to exclude the possibility of suitable lodging for senior
executives with salaries that can reach 50,000 francs per month,''
about $8,700.
   Frederica Koch and Amina Amara are among those keeping a vigil
with the homeless at the Place de la Reunion.
   Ms. Koch was evicted last year from the rent-controlled
apartment she occupied for 25 years and, at 58, is a squatter. She
lost her job as a clothes cutter during a 10-year battle to keep
her home.
   Ms. Amara, a single woman with five children, has been on a
waiting list for a low-rent apartment for 15 years. After eviction
from one building, she and her two youngest children spent a year
in a shabby hotel and two months in a restaurant basement before
squatting anew in December.
   ``This problem is too big for us,'' said Berhima Tembely, an
immigrant from Senegal who paid a sympathy visit to the square.
``The rich people are treating us like dogs. You have to fight to
live in this world.''

<HEAD>Khomeini's Ghost Still Stalks Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ghost of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
stalks the Islamic republic a year after his death, in the form of
a power struggle among the Imam's disciples that remains unresolved.
   The revolution Khomeini began 11 years ago survives,however,
frustrating the doomsayers who predicted it would fall apart when
he was no longer there to unite the factions.
   Moves by President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his ``pragmatists''
toward a more liberal course have been stymied by anti-Western
radicals who accuse him of straying from ` Imam,''
as Khomeini was known.
   Both groups claim to be Khomeini's true ideological heirs and
invoke his commandments to justify their actions.
   An Iranian official, speaking anonymously, said Rafsanjani
sought t`the path of theo legitimize his more liberal policies through
subtle
interpretations of Khomeini's teachings.
   In response, the 270-member parliament passed a law in May that
makes changing Khomeini's writings a crime. The parliament is
dominated by radical followers of Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former
interior minister.
   The radicals include Ahmad Khomeini, 44, the ayatollah's only
surviving son. He has made no apparent effort to claim his father's
mantle and is overshadowed by rotest demanding the government not involve
itself in the hostage
issue.
   Diplomats in Tehran say Rafsanjani appears determined to show
the West he is moving the country away from isolation.
   In an effort to create a more liberal social and political
climate, he has eased restrictions Khomeini placed on Iran's 55
million people. He cannot move quickly because of radical
opposition and faces growing discontent from a populace whose
expectations were raised when he gained power.
   There have been demonstrations against shortages, unemployment
estimated at 4 million, and high inflation. Opposition groups say
the Revolutionary Guards killed several protesters and arrested
scores.
   Some progress has been made. Diplomats estimate inflation was
trimmed from 30 percent to 20 percent in the past year and the
government has contracts for major investment projects estimated to
be worth billions of dollars.
   Rafsanjani's plans depend on oil revenue. It is expected to be
about $15 billion this year, but nothing is certain in the volatile
oil market.
   ``The authorities know they have at best one or two years grace
before economic problems produce dangerous political
dissatisfaction,'' Vahe Petrossian, an Iranian analyst based in
London, wrote last month in the Middle east Economic Digest.
   A waiter named Khosrow in a Tehran restaurant said: ``All I want
are three square meals a day for myself and my family. Someone has
to rule, but I don't really care who it is so long as I have enough
to provide a roof for my family.
   ``During the war I never complained, but enough is enough.''
   Mehrdad, a taxi driver, said: ``I think most of the people are
behind Rafsanjani and they know he's trying to do something good
for us.''
   Asked if restoring relations with the United States did not go
against Khomeini's teachings, he replied:
   ``The Imam said we must strike a blow against the United States.
How are we hurting the United States when we pay triple the price
for American goods because we buy them through middlemen?
   ``We would strike a more effective blow if we resumed ties and
rebuilt our economy and industry so we become truly independent and
powerful.''

<HEAD>Beatty Has Goods To Sell But Also Looking for Way To Cope</HEAD>
<HEAD>By BOB THOMAS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warren Beatty, once among the most secretive
of film stars, is suddenly popping up all over the place: Arsenio,
Oprah, Letterman, ``Good Morning, America'' and ``Today.''
   Why? Because he has some goods to sell, namely ``Dick Tracy,''
his stylish movie rendition of the old comic strip. But Beatty did
virtually nothing to promote his last three films, ``Ishtar,''
``Reds'' and ``Heaven Can Wait.''
   He recently explained the change of heart.
   ``For 12 or 13 years I didn't do much in the way of interviews.
That makes room for anybody to make up anything they want, and some
of the results can be disturbing. I decided there was no way to
cope with that unless you talk to people,'' he said.
   He has done more talking to the media in the past 10 days than
at any time in his 30-year film career. At the ``Dick Tracy''
premiere last week at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., he
conducted a news conference before a mass of reporters. Before
leaving for a round of satellite interviews in New York, Beatty
talked by telephone about the aftermath of the movie's opening.
   _ About the first weekend's gross _ $21 million from 2,200
screens: ``I've never had that kind of opening. The numbers are
great. I really never expected anything like it. After all, `Dick
Tracy' didn't have a following from a comic book or a TV series
(like `Batman').''
   _ About the reviews: ``They're amazing. Virtually unanimous. The
only bad one we got was one of the first by some guy whose name I
don't know.'' It was Joseph McBride of Daily Variety, who called
the film ``a major disappointment.'' Executives from the Walt
Disney Co. were so proud of the critical raves that they ran
double-page newspaper ads reprinting them in toto.
   Beatty first became interested in ``Dick Tracy'' many years ago,
but the project passed through other hands until he finally
resolved to make it with Disney. Why did he wait so long?
   ``It is such a detailed picture that it wasn't something you
could just go out and shoot. I was involved in other things,
including a Howard Hughes story I've been wanting to do. Then I
began getting ideas about how to do `Dick Tracy.' I think you get
around to making a picture when you can no longer put it off.''
   Most critics have praised the look of ``Dick Tracy'' _ the use
of the same basic colors without different shades. Beatty said the
concept originated in a conversation with playwright Herb Gardner
(``I'm Not Rappaport'').
   ``He used to do a comic strip, and he told me how the printer
had numbers for the colors on the rotogravure, which was the paper
they used in those days. For instance, red might be number 2, and
he would give the number to a hat, a car, a flower and so forth. I
was captivated by that idea.''
   Many reviewers commended the outlandish characters of Al Pacino
and Dustin Hoffman as well as the sex-charged Madonna. Beatty does
not appear to feel slighted that his own performance was sometimes
overlooked: ``What appealed to me was that the material allowed for
some outrageous performances. All the people were so interesting
that it was good for the picture.
   ``In the comic strip, Dick Tracy was always the solid guy in the
middle of all these weird characters. He was very, very straight,
and that's how I played him.''
   The initial prosperity of ``Dick Tracy'' has led to talk of a
sequel. Beatty commented cautiously: ``I've never done a sequel,
but I wouldn't totally rule it out. Then again, there are so many
other things to do. And movies aren't the only thing in my life.''

<HEAD>No Party is Blameless in S&amp;L Mess</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since politicians in both parties aided and
abetted the savings and loan scandal, it takes some rewriting of
history to make the mess into a 1990 congressional campaign issue
for either Republicans or Democrats.
   Both sides are trying, in a dispute that has them shouting about
blame but saying little about solutions to the problems behind the
biggest bailout in American history.
   After his spokesman waded into the S&amp;L dispute, President Bush
endorsed the counterattack, but claimed the high road. ``I think
more important than continuing to pour fuel on that spark is
continuing to work with the Congress in trying to get that mess
solved,'' he said Wednesday.
   The White House already had provided a text for Republican
revisionists by claiming that in the dead of night a decade ago,
Democrats pushed through legislation to sharply increase the
ceiling on deposit insurance and ease restrictions on savings and
loan lending practices.
   In fact, Republicans collaborated on the measure, which had a
GOP coauthor and overwhelming support in both parties. It passed
the House 380 to 13, with only five Republicans voting no. The
Senate approved it without a roll call vote.
   When President Jimmy Carter signed it on March 31, 1980, he
called it a bipartisan, landmark reform, an important move toward
deregulation and a boon to small savers.
   Democrats prefer to start the crisis clock running a bit later,
after Ronald Reagan took office, putting the blame on his
administration and his vice president, George Bush, for lax
regulation of savings and loans.
   When Reagan signed a bill in 1982 permitting S&amp;Ls to make
commercial loans and increase consumer lending _ leeway that
licensed riskier ventures with federally insured deposits _ he said
it was a long-term solution to industry problems.
   ``All in all, I think we hit the jackpot,'' he said.
   Some jackpot.
   That bill, it should be noted, had Democratic sponsorship and
support.
   Nor do Democrats talk much about the way House Democratic
leaders stalled and sliced measures to start dealing with industry
problems sooner, at costs that now look like a bargain. Resigned
House Speaker Jim Wright had a hand in that; his involvement with
savings and loan interests and his intervention with regulators
were factors in his downfall.
   Four of the five senators involved in the most celebrated of the
savings and loan cases are Democrats. The Senate Ethics Committee
is investigating their intercession with federal regulators on
behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr. and his now bankrupt Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, after he gave them campaign
contributions.
   So some Democrats have taken to arguing that the savings and
loan crisis should be viewed in two installments, before Bush and
after Bush. They argue that the Bush administration has mishandled
the bailout, miscalculated the cost, and done too little to
prosecute S&amp;L wrongdoers and reclaim their take. Bush says his goal
is to protect depositors and bring the guilty to justice, and that
he's doing both.
   But almost across the board, both parties have their problems.
   ``There's plenty of blame to go around,'' said Sen. Robert Dole
of Kansas, the Republican leader. ``In the final analysis, it lies
everywhere.''
   That's because of the attributes that have made savings and loan
interests so powerful politically and in lobbying for their aims.
There's a branch in almost every town, a bloc in every
congressional district, all with money to spend on campaign
contributions.
   That has led members of both parties to say, write and do things
they may now regret. The standard explanation is that the letter,
or phone call, or visit was in behalf of a constituent.
   ``There's enough _ a lot of responsibility for every place, but
I see some disturbing signs of Democrats wanting to make this
political to Republicans, and I just want to put them on notice
that this plays both ways and we're ready to play,'' White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in his surprise attack on
Tuesday.
   ``A big part of the problem here is that in the dead of night a
few years ago, the Democrats pushed through raising the limits to
$100,000 per person,'' he said.
   ``I am sure the president is concerned about this becoming a
campaign issue in 1992,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a critic of
the way the bailout is being managed, and a target of the Fitzwater
attack.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says the S&amp;L crisis will be a
heavyweight issue for Democrats in the 1992 presidential campaign.
Cuomo, who could be the Democratic challenger next time, is making
it one of his issues now, saying that because of lax regulators,
the bankers ``stole everything in sight. They fouled up everything
in sight and now you are paying.''
   Sen. Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., who wants Bush to set up an
independent commission to investigate the S&amp;L situation, said ``The
real danger with this terrible crisis is that it will deteriorate
into partisan warfare.''
   It is.

<HEAD>Policemen in Medellin: Profitable Targets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A policeman in the Medellin cartel's
hometown goes to work each day with an assault rifle, a bulletproof
vest and a prayer. The drug lords will pay $4,300 to anyone who
kills him.
   So far this year, more than 120 have been slain.
   Policemen say they live on nerve and in fear of being the next
victim.
   Some routinely arrive home with pistol drawn in case an assassin
lurks in the shadows. Dozens of of the victims were murdered while
off duty.
   Police in Medellin are part of a national force of 80,000 men,
which is part of the military and under Defense Ministry
jurisdiction.
   The government, which declared war on drug traffickers last
year, has sent 1,800 reinforcements in recent weeks to augment the
normal force of 2,600. The killings continue at an average of one a
day in this city of 3 million, Colombia's second-largest.
   If the same percentage of police officers was killed in New York
City, which has a force of 26,000, the total would surpass 1,000.
   An Associated Press reporter talked with 30 Medellin policemen
and accompanied seven on a patrol of a dangerous part of Medellin.
An officer pointed out the spots where six comrades had been killed
in the past two months.
   ``I get scared out here,'' one said. ``I see a movement in the
shadows or hear a motorcycle moving toward me and the hair stands
up on the back of my neck. I wonder if this is it. I wonder if I'm
the next victim.''
   None wanted his name used, figuring it would be a death warrant.
   High-ranking Medellin police officials refused to be interviewed
about the dangers their men face. The patrolmen said the drug
cartel's tactics had caused 300 police resignations in three months
and recruiting was difficult.
   ``I'm ready to quit if I don't get a transfer out of here
soon,'' a 20-year-old policeman said. ``We're just statistics.''
   He and the others said they were frightened, and exhausted by
working up to 18 hours six days a week, but most said they would
not quit.
   ``You can die of hunger, too,'' a 12-year veteran commented.
   Their families are destroyed along with the policemen. An
officer's widow gets only half his $95 monthly salary as a pension,
said a spokesman for the national police in Bogota.
   Three widows said they could not support their children on that.
   ``My children don't get milk, they don't get meat, they don't
know what eggs taste like,'' Ruth Duque said. ``When they get sick,
we just pray. There isn't any money for medicine.''
   Mrs. Duque's situation is even worse because she gets no pension
at all. Her husband was killed March 23, 1988, before the pension
law was passed.
   She said she makes the equivalent of about $102 a month working
in a drugstore. She feeds her son and daughter, aged 4 and 3, one
meal a day of rice and beans.
   Colombia's minimum wage equals about $100 a month. A quart of
milk costs 75 cents and a one-pound loaf of bread $1.
   Unemployment is over 30 percent in Medellin, according to
sociologists at the local university. The government says the rate
is 10 percent, but doesn't count thousands of people who mow lawns,
work as sidewalk peddlers or have other part-time jobs.
   ``I've been looking for a job ever since my husband was
killed,'' said Socorro Rua. Her husband was killed May 19 by a man
who stuck a gun in his ribs on a crowded bus.
   Her 15-year-old daughter, Liliana, turned her head away and
tears coursed down her cheeks. Mrs. Rua also has a 6-year-old son,
Carlos.
   They live in an apartment complex built by the government for
policemen. The shabby three-room apartment costs only $20 a month,
but even that may be out of reach because officials have told her
the pension paperwork will take a year.
   Another widow, Carmen Montoya, said she had high hopes for their
children when her husband was alive, but ``now we just try to get
by day to day. My little boy wanted a toy car for his birthday. I
cried when he asked me, because I knew I couldn't afford it. They
don't get anything at Christmas.''
   ``My little girl used to chatter and sing all the time before
her daddy was killed,'' she said. ``Now she just stares and hardly
says a word.
   ``I asked the police department to pay for a psychologist to see
her, but they told me there is no money for that.''
   Mrs. Montoya has two children _ Lina, 5, and Alexander, 3. She
receives about $80 a month because her husband had 20 years on the
force.

   The Korean War, sometimes called the forgotten

<TEXT>
   On a Sunday morning 40 years ago,
North Korea sent thousands of troops across the 38th parallel into
South Korea, starting a war that killed more than a million people,
including 54,000 American soldiers.
   It is the only war the United States has entered in this century
that remains unresolved. The Korean peninsula, divided after World
War II, still is split between the communist North and the
capitalist South.
   The invasion stunned and enraged the West. The North Koreans
occupied Seoul, the South Korean capital, in three days and overran
most of the southern half of the peninsula in six weeks.
   Fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for South Korea under the
U.S.-led United Nations Command. Another 25 provided medical aid,
food and weapons.
   China, with war just across its border, sent hundreds of
thousands of soldiers to help the North.
   When a cease-fire took effect 37 months later, the losses were
staggering: an estimated 2.4 million soldiers and 4.4 million
civilians killed or wounded. Military dead totaled more than
800,000. A land of remarkable beauty lay ravaged, treeless, burned
Jand barren.
   The Korean War was a traumatic chapter in American history and
its impact on succeeding generations has been profound.
   It was an inglorious war without victory, often nearly
forgotten, patched into history between World War II and Vietnam.
No peace treaty has been signed.
   ``It was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for
the first time, in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by
history,'' President Bush said at a dinner for veterans of the war.
   Korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the
nuclear age. It intensified hostilities between East and West, and
and spurred a U.S.-Soviet arms race that only now is ending.
   From it grew the notion that communism in East Asia could be
contained with help from the U.S. military. That led to American
intervention in Vietnam a decade later.
   Forty years after the battle, North and South Korea watch one
another from behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side
of a demilitarized zone 2{ miles wide and 155 miles long.
   The single telephone line between them is in Red Cross offices.
There is no mail, radio or television communication, no direct
travel without the permission of both governments, which is hardly
ever given.
   Nearly 9,000 American military personnel still are unaccounted
for or listed as prisoners.
   Last month, in a gesture seen as a political overture to
Washington, North Korea returned what it said were the remains of
five American soldiers. It was the first such action since 1954.
   The American Korean War Veterans Association says it has reports
from witnesses indicating some Americans still may be alive in
North Korea or other communist countries.
   Sporadic dialogue has occurred between the Koreas over the
years, but little progress has been made in lessening tension,
mutual suspicion and distrust. They have accused each other of more
than 1 million violations of the armistice agreement, an average of
75 a day since the war ended.
   Reunification of the peninsula, long a dream of Koreans on both
sides, remains elusive.
   The United States keeps 43,000 soldiers in South Korea to deter
another invasion. There are plans to reduce the number, but some
U.S. forces are expected to remain indefinitely.
   For Washington, the conflict of 1950-53 was a war in which the
politicians wrenched control from the generals. It is remembered as
much for President Harry Truman's firing of Douglas MacArthur as
for the general's bold strategy of pushing the enemy back with an
amphibious landing at Inchon, a western port.
   Historians divide the Korean war into the first year of
dramatic, far-reaching maneuvers and the next two years of static,
positional battle.
   Americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war
fought in foxholes and trenches on rugged, mountainous terrain that
was freezing in winter and scorching in summer.
   No place was so cold, so dirty. Grease from a hundred C rations
was frozen to parkas and gloves. Underwear wasn't changed for
months. Perspiration in boots turned to ice in winter. Blood froze
on wounds before it could coagulate.
   Men fought hand-to-hand for small pieces of territory called
Punchbowl, Pork Chop Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Bunker Hill. Each
changed hands many times.
   More than 5 million men and women served in the American forces.
Their casualties were 103,284 wounded and 54,246 dead, including
33,629 killed in combat. The infantry bore the brunt of the
fighting.
   What began as a crusade to save South Korea from communism
enjoyed only brief public popularity. Soldiers returned home not to
a hero's welcome, but to a public dissatisfied with an unpopular,
unsatisfactory war.
   Weary soldiers, disheartened and dispirited, faded into the
placid, properous American society of the 1950s, keeping their pain
to themselves.
   Not until Vietnam veterans received public attention did the
Korean vets begin to organize. They formed an association five
years ago and are trying to raise $10.5 million for a memorial.
Korea is the only war without a memorial in Washington.
   In South Korea, the war is called the 6-25 incident, reflecting
the date it began and the Korean preference for numbering rather
than naming events.
   Some South Koreans feel shame that the country needed help to
defend itself and the anniversary is not a cause for celebration.
   Many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to
the Americans. Monuments have been built in rice paddies and town
squares to all nations that sent soldiers and aid.
   The relationship between South Korea and the United States has
changed dramatically in the past 40 years. South Korea's booming
economy and growing pride in its own accomplishments make it less
tolerant of pressure from Washington on economic, trade and
political issues.
   Anti-American sentiment continues to grow. Visiting
Korean-Americans say relatives and others scold them for wearing
American-style haircuts and clothes, and for speaking Korean with
American accents.
   Most Koreans disapprove of militants who burn U.S. flags and
shout ``Yankee go home,'' however, and polls indicate they want
American troops to remain.

   It was a week of sadness in Shadyside, a
time for goodbyes that were all too sudden and too soon.
   There were farewells to the young mother who sang in the church
choir and to the little boys she loved so dearly. To husbands and
wives who lived, then died together. To sons and daughters who
played side by side.
   Ten days ago, they were victims of nature's fury, a flash flood
that killed 23 people, a torrent of water that swept away lives,
homes and businesses, ravaging the outskirts of this Appalachian
foothills community.
   ``God never makes you face anything greater than you can
handle,'' says Schools Superintendent Bob Henry. But, he says,
``Sometimes it really saps your faith.''

   In the office of Jefferson Elementary School, school board
member Bette Anne Ponzo fields calls at the makeshift crisis center
and clutches two pieces of paper: one bearing the names of 23 dead,
the other those of 11 missing. As more bodies are found, one list
grows longer, the other shorter.
   In this town of 4,300, so many people have so many memories of
the dead.
   Ronald Palmer remembers Jerry and Patsy Krupa, a young couple
just starting out in life. ``They'd do anything in the world for
you, help you in any way they could,'' says Palmer, 30, a
firefighter who knew Jerry since kindergarten.
   Patsy's 28th birthday was last Sunday _ the day her body was
found.
   Becky Glaser remembers her daughter's friend Kerri Polivka, 13,
a gifted student. ``She danced. She sang. She did everything,''
Mrs. Glaser recalls.
   Mrs. Ponzo remembers John and Edna Andrecht. He was a retired
school janitor; she baked breads and canned goods for friends.
   Mrs. Ponzo's husband, Ray, remembers the Humphrey boys, David,
10, and Danny, 8, who died with their 35-year-old mother, Sue.
   Sue was in the church choir and played flute when she was in
high school. David was a budding saxophonist. Both played for
Ponzo, the band director.
   ``Sue was quiet, but energetic,'' Ponzo says. ``David was the
same. Must have been patterned after her. He tried hard.''
   One generation, then another, now both gone.
   ``It's always hard for me when a young person goes,'' Ponzo
says. ``I'm 59. I've pretty much done a lot of the things I should
do, but they'll never have a chance. ...''
   Mrs. Ponzo's eyes brim with tears. ``You watch kids grow up and
have families,'' she says. ``When something like this happens, you
hurt. They're part of you.''
   ``Every time there's a loss here, somebody knows them,'' Mrs.
Glaser says. ``Everybody knows everybody's kids. That's why you
call it home.''

   The Pipe and Wegee creeks, two normally tranquil tributaries of
the Ohio River, erupted June 15 when 5{ inches of rain fell in less
than three hours. A wall of water, 20 feet high and 300 feet wide _
as long as a football field _ tore through the hollows, ripping
asphalt from the ground, snapping trees like toothpicks, hurling
cars in the air and sweeping people out of their homes.
   It came so fast, there was no warning.
   But for every tragedy, for every death, there are amazing
stories of survival in Shadyside, tales of people beating the odds,
literally hanging on for their lives. Helen Saffle is one.
   On the flood night, the 54-year-old diabetic was at home when
the power went out and the water rushed in. Soon it was waist-high.
   The couch started to float. She latched onto it. She thought
she'd climb to the ceiling for air, but when she looked, the roof
was gone.
   The raging water smashed her house to pieces and sucked her out.
She grabbed a tank, let go, repeatedly ducked under the water to
avoid debris.
   ``I kept calm. I prayed all the time,'' she says. ``Then I came
up against something solid. It was a tree uprooted. ... I was
completely naked. I had a gown but (had pulled it off because) it
was smothering and choking me.''
   ``I remember at one time I thought this must be a dream,'' she
recalls. ``I said, `No, This is like the Johnstown flood.' ''
   A rescuer eventually heard Mrs. Saffle's screams and carried her
to safety. She was bruised and cut, but otherwise unharmed. ``If it
was God's will for me to die, I would have. He needed me for some
reason.''
   Perhaps it was divine intervention that brought the survivors
through; perhaps it was their own wits and willpower. But many told
similar stories.
   Nine-year-old Amber Colvin and her babysitter, Kerri Polivka,
tried to float in a bathtub. The tub broke and Kerri was killed,
but Amber clung to a log and wooden shingles in the Ohio River for
seven hours before she was able to paddle to shore, about seven
miles from home.
   ``I can doggie paddle a little, but I only had to do that
once,'' she says. Ken Gibbons, who owned the now-destroyed 3 K's
Night Club, grabbed his home's rafters as the house was ripped off
its foundation. It carried him about 800 yards.
   ``You ever see a ball in a pinball machine? That's what it was
like. I could hear it (the house) hitting stuff and crunching,'' he
says, surveying his crushed 1979 red Corvette and shiny '83 gold
Jaguar and clutching one of his remaining belongings _ the muddy
1947 wedding certificate of his late parents.
   His brother, Charlie, whose trailer was destroyed, was swept
under a house as he tried to get his wife and neighbor onto a porch.
   Though Charlie Gibbons has heart trouble, he climbed a tree,
inching higher as the water rose. ``When you're scared, you've got
strength, believe me,'' he says, puffing on a cigarette.
   ``If his heart didn't get him, and the water didn't get him,''
says his wife, Fran, ``he says he's going to live forever.''

   For rescuers, it was a week of facing death and destruction,
eyeball-to-eyeball.
   ``You take a house, throw it in a big blender, with all its
contents _ including human _ mix it up, spit it out, that's what it
is,'' says Pat Swallie, a rescuer and public safety coordinator.
   ``We're seeing autos bent around trees bumper to bumper,'' he
says. ``The dump trucks were like Tonka toys. The stench of decay,
the smell of stagnant water, diesel fuel, raw sewage, dead
animals.''
   Though final damage estimates haven't been made, more than 850
houses in a three-county area of southeast Ohio were destroyed or
damaged.
   More than than 500 National Guard troops, dozens of dog teams,
mounted police, local fire and police and mine rescuers have worked
with bulldozers, shovels and their hands, digging, probing and
hoping for a miracle.
   One body was discovered 25 miles downstream in a logjam of
debris near the Hannibal Dam.
   There have been other heartbreaking moments. One rescuer found
his sister's body in the debris. He continued digging.
   Another discovered a woman clutching a pocketbook. Its only
contents were tissues and a notepad from the funeral home where she
eventually was taken.

   ``You never get used to it,'' Swallie says. The rescuers share
their experiences. ``You don't hold it in. If you do, you're in
trouble.''
   But they forge on, if for no other reason than to end the
uncertainty.
   ``People need to know, they need to bury their dead,'' Mrs.
Ponzo says. ``They need to know there is a final resting place for
them.''
   ``We're pulling together, but it's hard,'' says firefighter
Palmer, who aided in the search effort. ``We're doing the best we
can. It's all so sad.''

<TEXT>
   Amid all the devastation, there are signs of renewal in
Shadyside.
   ``I know we will never be the same again as a town,'' says Bobbi
Brown, a schoolteacher. ``(But) you go on. You appreciate life
more.''
   Scores have lined up for applications for federal disaster aid,
including Ken Gibbons, who estimates his losses at $300,000.
   ``Twenty years of work, 20 minutes it's all gone,'' he says,
shaking his head. He's uncertain whether he'll rebuild his business.
   Fran and Charlie Gibbons will find another place to live.
   ``There ain't nothing here anymore,'' he says, staring at the
rubble-strewn field where his trailer once stood. ``It's not even
like home after 30-something years.''
   His wife has nightmares of her home being encased in mud. ``It's
like something you love, and now you're afraid of it,'' she says.
   But others are determined to stay. Even in its wretched
condition, Shadyside is their home.
   Martha Wright Foster says her father's home is salvageable. ``He
lived through the '36 flood, the Depression and World War II. ...
He wanted this piece of property ever since he was a little boy. He
wants back in.''
   ``If you didn't have hope for starting over,'' says Mrs. Ponzo,
``there wouldn't be much sense in getting up.''

   The U.S. economy grew at its second slowest
pace in 3{ years from January through March, the government
reported.
   Analysts said they expect only modest improvement for the rest
of the year. But the economists said any future growth would be
fueled larely by exports because of a fall off in consumer
spending, which had been a driving force for much of the economic
expansion.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday the gross national product
_ the nation's total output of goods and services _ grew at a
revised 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter.

   Serious economic problems from tightened

far from a broad-based credit crunch, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said.
   ``To date, we have found that lenders have tightened their

so far at least, been a broad-based squeeze on credit,'' Greenspan
told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
   ``Nonetheless, significant problems cannot be ruled out in the

<HEAD>Securities Industry Optimistic About Stock Index Futures Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A securities industry group pushing for
passage of legislation to let the Securities and Exchange
Commission regulate stock index futures says it is growing more
optimistic each day there is no vote.
   ``I think right now it's a toss-up. A week ago I'd say we were a
decided underdog,'' said Joseph R. Hardiman, president and chief
executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers. ``Give
us more time and I think we'll prevail.''
   The NASD, which oversees the over-the-counter market, is part of
the ad hoc Coalition for Intermarket Coordination that's been
meeting with senators this week to push for passage of the
amendement.
   Other members include: the American Stock Exchange, the Boston
Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Pacific
Stock Exchange and the National Securities Clearing Corp.
   Last month the Treasury Department unveiled legislation that
would strip the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of authority
over stock index futures and give it to the rival SEC.
   The administration and the SEC said the measure is necessary to
prevent sharp rises and drops in market prices. The futures
industry and the CFTC strongly oppose the bill.
   The proposal also would give the SEC authority to oversee stock
index futures margins, the downpayment required of investors who
buy the contracts on credit.
   The futures exchanges currently set those margins, which are
generally much lower than those of securities. The SEC and Treasury
have said low margins on stock index futures were partly to blame
for the 1987 stock market crash and the 190-point drop last October.
   Stock index futures allow investors to speculate on movements in
the stock market without buying the underlying stocks.
   The administration proposal was introduced as a separate bill in
the House but will be included in CFTC market reform legislation
that has been pending since last fall.
   ``Our position is getting stronger with every day,'' Hardiman
added. ``If you'd asked us a week ago we would have said `Heavens
don't let them take a vote now!' Today we're saying things are
looking a lot better because we've had an opportunity to tell our
story and the more people we tell it to the more ears we get that
are willing to listen.''
   In a joint interview with Philadelphia Stock Exchange President
Nicholas A. Giordano and Options Clearing Corp. Chairman Wayne
Luthringshausen, Hardiman said members of the group had spoken with
25 to 30 senators.
   ``I think there's a lot of undecided votes,'' said
Luthringshausen, the coalition's chairman.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Store Closures, Benefits for Thousands of Laid Off
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 18,000 workers who will lose their jobs when
Ames Department Stores Inc. closes more than 200 stores this summer
will receive vacation and severance pay under a plan approved in
federal bankruptcy court.
   Judge Howard C. Buschman III authorized both the closures and
the pay plan during a hearing Thursday. The pay plan, which will
cost Ames $25 million, also includes checks for 6,600 workers laid
off when Ames closed some stores just before its April 25 Chapter
11 filing.
   ``The employees have a stake in this company as well as
everybody else,'' Buschman said. ``I don't think anyone in this
room is comfortable with the notion that there are 18,000 people
that are about to be terminated.''
   The judge approved the company's plan to pay vacation and
severance benefits over the objection of a committee of the
company's creditors.
   ``The company's position is that ... we're trying to save the
jobs of 32,000 people,'' spokesman Harris Diamond said, referring
to the employees Ames expects to retain. ``The judge basically
authorized them to go ahead.''
   The judge also approved the closure of 219 of Ames' 679 stores
in the eastern United States and two distribution centers.
   He delayed action until mid-July on a request to close two other
stores after Albert Togut, an attorney for employees, claimed the
stores weren't unprofitable, as Ames had said.
   The Rocky Hill, Conn.-based company filed for bankruptcy largely
because of problems that stemmed from its $788 million acquisition
of the Zayre chain in 1988. That purchase transformed Ames from a
Northeast retailer into the country's fourth-largest discounter.
Most of the stores slated for closure are former Zayre stores.
   The hearing was delayed for much of the day by the creation of a
committee of eight former and current Ames workers to represent
employees.
   The creditor's committee had requested that laid off employees
be paid only a portion of the vacation and severance pay due them.
Buschman, citing sympathy for the thousands of affected workers,
called for an employees' committee to participate in negotiating an
agreement.
   An analyst at a New York investment firm that specializes in
bankruptcies said bringing employees into the negotiations could
set a precedent.
   Although it remains to be seen how much power the employees'
committee will have, ``it would change the face of bankruptcy if
you have to take them into account,'' said Steve Lampe of R.D.
Smith.
   The agreement calls for Ames to pay $7.8 million in vacation pay
to the 18,000 workers, and $16.5 million in severance pay. It also
calls for Ames to pay $850,000 in vacation pay to the 6,600
employees laid off just before the bankruptcy filing.
   The company employed about 55,000 people before the filing.
   Another part of the plan requires Ames to assign advisors to
each targeted store to help employees search for jobs and write
resumes.
   ``I recognize the tragedy,'' the judge said. ``I have been
urging this debtor to give you people a good shot at getting jobs.''
   The judge also approved Ames' plan to conduct ``going out of
business'' sales at the stores, which are scheduled to close by the
end of the summer.
   The sales will be managed by Jubilee Co. of Columbus, Ohio, and
two other liquidation firms, said George Granoff, president and
chief operating officer of Ames.
   Diamond said Ames expects to receive $144 million from the sales.
   On Tuesday, Ames reported first-quarter losses of $430.9
million, mostly because of the costs of closing stores. The loss
gave the discount retailer a negative stockholder's equity, or net
worth, of minus $74 million.
   The stores to be closed are in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Virginia and West Virginia.
   The distribution centers to be closed are in Plant City, Fla.,
and Worcester, Mass.
   On Wednesday, Ames filed documents with Buschman seeking
permission to reject employment contracts it had signed with four
former top executives. The company said it cannot afford to
continue paying the approximately $1.4 million a yar in salaries it
owes to the four.
   Buschman has scheduled a hearing on the matter July 17.

<HEAD>Source: Short-Term Loan Might Be Needed To Cover Trump Bond
Payment</HEAD>

   Bankers working to cement a $65 million loan to
keep Donald Trump from defaulting on millions in junk bond payments
aren't likely to finish the paperwork in time, an individual
involved in the talks said.
   As a result, the cash-squeezed developer is likely to need a
separate short-term loan to make a $43 million bond payment by a
midnight Tuesday deadline, said the source, who spoke Thursday on
condition of anonymity.
   Even if the bank's complex plan to restructure Trump's debt is
approved by lenders, there isn't enough time to finalize any
agreement before the deadline, the source said.
   Last Friday, Trump missed the $43 million payment of interest
and principal on two bond issues used to finance the Trump Castle
hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Under the terms of the bond covenants, Trump has a 10-day grace
period to make the payment before he can be declared in default.
   Defaulting on a total of $352 million in bonds could threaten
Trump's licenses from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and
lead to his losing control of the Trump Castle.
   A default also could trigger other defaults in the developer's
casino and real estate empire and force Trump to seek protection in
bankruptcy court.
   A plan to lend Trump another $65 million and defer interest and
principal payments has been held up by three Japanese banks and a
West German bank. The four banks each hold $15 million worth of an
outstanding $75 million loan made to Trump by Chase Manhattan Bank,
said the source.
   The banks _ Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
and Dresdner Bank _ have balked at a plan to put a second lien on
the Trump Tower, the residential and commercial skyscraper on Fifth
Avenue in Manhattan, The New York Times reported Thursday. The
banks' loans are protected by the current lien on the building, the
newspaper said.
   The Times also reported that there was trouble in negotiations
over whether cash flow from Trump's properties would be directed to
the new loans.
   Trump's ability to move money from his cash-rich properties,
such as the Trump Plaza casino, have helped him stay afloat,
analysts have said.
   The bond agreement on the Plaza allows Trump to take all but $8
million annually from the available cash flow. He then can use the
money to subsidize properties that drain cash, such as 100 acres of
abandoned railroad yards on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   Thus far, Trump has taken $50 million out of the Plaza in the
form of dividends, said Larry Klatzkin, a bond analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The downturn in the New York real estate market and the
struggling Atlantic City casino industry have cut into the amount
of cash Trump has to spread around his empire.
   Assuming the Plaza continues generating cash, Trump would be
able to draw on even more beginning next year. The agreements with
bondholders, reached when the bonds were issued in 1986, will no
longer require him to leave behind $8 million a year.
   Additionally, he would be able to draw upon the money he has
been forced to leave in the casino.
   Late Thursday, Trump announced he sold a Dutch shipyard near
Amsterdam for an undisclosed price. Trump bought the Amels shipyard
a little over a year ago for $5 million to ensure completion of
work on a 420-foot yacht, New York Newsday reported last month.
   Trump said through a spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, that he made
a substantial profit on the sale.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's stubbornly high trade surplus with the
United States is the result of ``natural'' factors, not closed
markets, the trade ministry said in its annual report today.
   The ministry said Japan benefits by emphasizing exports of high
value manufactured goods while the United States relies more on the
sale of minerals and agricultural commodities.
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's 1989 white
paper on trade and the economy also said statistics show Japan's
mammoth overall trade surplus will continue to fall, despite the
yen's relative weakness against other currencies.
   The report was released as Japan and the United States were
preparing to meet June 25 for a final round of trade talks on
economic reforms aimed at changing business practices and policies
that inhibit trade and investment.
   It said difficulties in slashing Japan's $49 billion trade
surplus with the United States could be ``explained naturally.''
   A gradual recovery in U.S. export competitiveness boosted U.S.
exports to Japan 65.9 percent between 1986 and 1989, while U.S.
exports to the European Community rose 62.9 percent, it said.
   But while the United States posted a $1.5 billion trade surplus
with the EC last year _ a significant improvement over its $20.6
billion deficit in 1987, it ran a $49 billion deficit with Japan.
   That was a slight improvement from a record $56.3 billion gap in
1987, but still huge compared to 1980's $9.9 billion deficit,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
   The report attributed the slower recovery in the U.S. trade
balance with Japan to the composition of goods traded.
   Higher value manufactured goods account for 80.6 percent of U.S.
exports to Europe, but only 58 percent of U.S. exports to Japan, it
said. Other exports to Japan included grain, meat, lumber, iron ore
and coal.
   The report said 78.1 percent of Japan's exports to the United
States were machinery and transport goods for ``sustaining and
expanding U.S. domestic industrial activity.'' In contrast,
European exports included more primary products, it said.
   Japan's exports are increasingly high-tech products that are
``essential to the production and other economic activities of
companies in the countries that are importing them,'' the report
said.
   It said there were signs of a ``stable trend'' toward continued
growth in imports and reduced reliance by Japanese companies on
exports, despite the yen's relative weakness against other major
currencies.
   The ministry said the yen's average value fell to 138 to the
dollar in 1989 from 128.2 in 1988. In 1985, when the major
industrial nations agreed to strengthen the yen to help correct
trade imbalances, the dollar bought 238.5 yen.
   Economists have said a weaker yen, which makes Japanese products
cheaper on world markets, could abort efforts to curb the trade
imbalance.
   Indeed, the Japanese government earlier this week said the
country's economy grew strongly in the three months ended in March
because of a fresh surge in exports.
   The trade ministry said Japan's total trade surplus in 1989 was
$76.92 billion, down from $95.02 billion in 1988.
   Imports grew 12.5 percent to $210.8 billion last year. For the
first time ever, more than half of those imports _ 50.3 percent _
were manufactured goods, the report said. In 1985, only 31 percent
of Japan's imports were manufactured goods.
   ``We consider the fact that imports rose, despite the weak yen,
to signify that import expansion is here to stay,'' said Kazukiyo
Higuchi, director of MITI's International Trade Research Office.
   But the ministry's figures also show that exchange rates and
other factors brought the rate of increase in the value of imports
down from 18.3 percent in 1987 and 25.3 percent in 1988. Growth in
the volume of imports also slowed _ to 7.8 percent last year from
16.7 percent in 1988 and over 9 percent in 1987 and 1988.
   The report said Japan's exports climbed only 3.9 percent in 1989
to $275.2 billion, down from a 15.6 percent increase in 1988.
Exports were down 2.2 percent to $66.7 billion in the first three
months of this year.
   Manufacturers in many sectors have begun to wean themselves from
strong dependence on exports, the report said.
   Automakers rely on exports for 34.6 percent of their sales, down
from 46.4 percent in 1985, it said. Japanese industry as a whole
gets only 20.2 percent of sales from exports, compared with 25.5
percent in 1985.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of the treaty that
prepares the economic merger of the two Germanys by July 2.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OVERVIEW _ The two Germanys agree to create a monetary, economic
and social union as a first step to unification under the West
German Constitution. The international implications of German
unification need to be resolved in talks among the four victorious
World War II powers _ the Soviet Union, the United States, Great
Britain and France.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MONETARY UNION _ On July 2, the West German mark becomes the
legal tender in East Germany. The West German Bundesbank, or
central bank, will have full control over monetary policy in both
countries. The economic union will be based on a free-market
economy, including private property, competition and workers'
rights.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONVERSION RATES _ Workers will have their wages converted from
East German marks to West German marks at a 1-1 rate.
   For savings deposits, East Germans 14 and younger will be able
to convert up to $1,200 at a 1-1 rate. Those aged 15-59 will be
able to convert $2,400 at the 1-1 rate. People 60 and older can
covert up $3,600 at the favorable rate. All other savings will be
converted at two East German marks for one West mark.
   East German pensions will be brought to West German levels,
raising most of them.
   Debts will be converted at a 2-1 rate, more favorable to
troubled East German companies.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The streets of Warsaw show an economic
revolution in progress six months after the government jolted the
country with market-oriented reform, but the faces of the people
show the human cost.
   Poland's plunge into capitalism Jan. 1 was far bolder than any
program undertaken by neighboring countries also shedding their
communist past.
   Some people are obviously thriving. New Mercedes and Volvos with
Polish license plates are a common sight on Warsaw streets. A few
luxury boutiques sell dresses and suits for more than the average
month's salary, and do not lack for customers.
   There has been a general enlivening of commerce.
   But there also is the pathetic sight of old people counting out
a few zlotys to buy one or two rolls, and the banners announcing
the sale of gas guns to counter the crime wave that police experts
blame on the hard times.
   According to government statistics, the country has entered a
deep recession.
   Poland's rocky experience during the first six months of
switching to a market economy is giving pause to its giant neighbor
to the east.
   Soviet officials so far have rejected radical economic reform
along Polish lines, apparently admitting they do not have the
political credibility to survive such a rapid transition.
   Instead, Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov proposed in late May a
``regulated market economy'' that called for bread prices to triple
July 1 and other prices to double Jan. 1.
   Panic buying and popular discontent forced postponement of the
bread price increases.
   Such half-measures typified Poland during the 1980s until
Solidarity came to power and its economists declared it was
impossible to leap a wide chasm in short steps.
   Bolstered by strong popular support, the Solidarity-led
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki instituted a plan
that instantly liberated most prices after decades of control but
kept wages tied down.
   State subsidies for enterprises were ended. The easy flow of
bank credits were staunched by high interest rates. The
deficit-ridden state budget was balanced.
   The Polish zloty was made fully convertible inside Poland,
backed by a $1 billion reserve fund lent by Western nations. That
eliminated the confusing array of legal, semi-legal and illegal
exchange rates.
   After nearly six months, the plan's architect, Finance Minister
Leszek Balcerowicz, can claim a certain success, said Polish
economics journalist Krzystof Bien in an interview.
   ``What he has managed to do so far has never been accomplished
before,'' he said.
   ``However it is not yet the stage that would permit us to say
that we are irrevocably on the road to a market economy. Everything
we have achieved so far could be destroyed in a day,'' Bien said.
   The chief potential danger, he said, is a resurgence of
inflation if the government relaxes its strict pay policies in
response to recent industrial strikes and protests by small private
farmers.
   Taming runaway inflation, estimated at more than 1,000 percent
in 1989, has been the greatest achievement of the program so far.
Prices spiked up when the plan was launched, but the tight controls
on wages and lending soon brought them down.
   Statistics tell the story. Prices grew 79 percent in January, 24
percent in February, 4.7 percent in March, 8.1 percent in April and
5 percent in May.
   Freeing prices while holding down wages had an immediate effect
on supplies in stores. Suddenly, the chronic shortages evaporated
because of the drop in demand caused by the high pricetags. Then as
supplies become more reliable, consumers stopped hoarding, further
helping keep the shelves stocked.
   For consumers with money, Poland has become _ if not yet a
shopper's paradise _ at least a country where one can find most of
life's essentials and a few luxuries without irritating lines or
complicated barters, bribes and deals.
   Sellers are chasing buyers, and not the other way around as
before. Former luxuries such as bananas and lemons are now sold on
the street, and food stands that have sprung up serve customers at
night, on weekends and on holidays. Warsaw even has a 24-hour
French grocery.
   On the down side, unemployment is about 400,000 people, or about
3 percent of the work force. Joblessness, officially non-existent a
year ago, is expected to grow to 9 percent, or 1.3 million people,
this year.
   Faced with high interest rates and reduced demand, many
factories slowed production to a trickle. Output by government
industry is down about 30 percent. The dire picture is probably
offset somewhat by increased production in the private sector where
government statistics are less reliable.
   With wages tied down by punitive taxes and prices steadily
rising, especially in January and February, real incomes dropped
dramatically _ down about 40 percent, according to official
statistics. But again, the numbers do not fully reflect the
burgeoning private business activity.
   ``I am an optimist,'' said Slawomir Rudnicki, the proud co-owner
of the new French grocery. ``It would have been impossible to open
this shop a few years ago.''
   But in the next breath he goes on to present a long list of
complaints against petty officials and regulations that still
hinder business _ like the rule that the bottled mineral water he
imports be submitted to a health check each time his truck crosses
the Polish border.

<HEAD>Pathe, MGM-UA Announce New Terms to Proposed Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp. got four
more months to try to acquire MGM-UA Communications Co. with a new
deal that raises the purchase price by $100 million, the companies
said.
   The new arrangement was announced Thursday amid questions over
whether Pathe's top financial backer, Time Warner Inc., would bow
out of the deal due to concerns Pathe was borrowing too much money.
   Under the new $1.3 billion acquisition plan, holders of common
and preferred MGM-UA stock will receive $21.50 per share, up from
the original buyout price of $20 a share, Pathe and MGM-UA said.
   But stockholders now will receive payments of $4 a share on July
20, with the balance of $17.50 expected to be paid on or before
Oct. 23 of this year. The deadline for the former deal was to have
been Saturday.
   Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, has
extended its offer several times past its original closing date of
April 30.
   Part of the $4 payment will come out of an escrow account into
which Pathe already has deposited $200 million. The additional $53
million necessary to make the $4 payment to stockholders of record
on July 10 is to be deposited by Pathe on July 16.
   Pathe intends to merge a newly formed subsidiary with MGM-UA,
and MGM-UA will seek shareholder approval for the merger. Kirk
Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. said it has agreed to vote for the
merger.
   Pathe is obligated to consummate a tender offer if the merger is
not concluded for any reason.
   In support of the acquisition, Pathe will deliver to escrow an
additional $100 million, consisting of two installments of $50
million each to be paid on Aug. 21 and Sept. 20 of this year.
   Pathe's problems are with its chief backer, Time Warner Inc.,
which has agreed to loan Pathe $650 million. Time Warner would get
a lien on the United Artists movie library, distribution rights to
that library, and distribution rights to future Pathe and MGM-UA
releases as part of the deal.
   According to a published report Thursday, Time Warner was
contemplating pulling out of the deal. Daily Variety, citing
anonymous sources, said Time Warner was considering the move
because Pathe was relying on debt and not equity to finance its
purchase of MGM-UA.
   Time Warner has insisted the $600 million remaining to close the
deal must not come from borrowed funds and that Pathe put up $450
million of that equity itself.
   But Pathe said in a statement Thursday negotiations with Time
Warner were continuing.
   A Time Warner spokeswoman agreed.
   ``We assume that the purpose of Pathe's obtaining the extension
is to continue our discussions as to how Pathe can satisfy the
conditions of our agreement, and we are continuing the
discussions,'' said spokeswoman Marilyn Harris.
   She would not comment on the Daily Variety report.
   MGM-UA has been virtually dormant in movie production during the
past two years, since Kerkorian put the company on the auction
block.
   So far, Pathe head Parretti's proposed patchwork of loans
through European affiliates of Pathe has failed to meet Time
Warner's criteria.

<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. has appointed a Cincinnati lawyer
who is a partner with the law firm representing the company's
largest shareholder as its new chairman.
   Phoenix-based Circle K, the nation's second largest
convenience-store chain, on Thursday named Bart A. Brown Jr., a
senior partner in the law firm of Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp, to
replace Karl Eller.
   Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp represents American Financial Corp.,
Circle K's largest shareholder.
   Eller resigned as chairman and chief executive officer on May 7.
   Brown will be chairman. The post of chief executive remains
vacant, the company said.
   Brown, 58, was picked for the job because of his expertise in
acquisitions, dispositions and debt restructuring, a spokesman for
Circle K said.
   Circle K is in deep financial difficulty, having filed for
Chapter 11 protection from its creditors May 15 in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court here, listing more than $1 billion in debt.
   Kevin Irwin, a colleague of Brown and the head of the bankruptcy
department in their law firm, said Brown's strong business-law
background makes him ideal for the post.
   ``He's one of the leading business (law) practitioners in
Cincinnati,'' Irwin said. ``He has a very strong tax background and
has had a great deal of exposure to bankruptcy. In terms of
financial acumen, he's one of the more respected lawyers in town.''
   Brown, who has practiced law for 35 years, has law degrees from
the University of Louisville and Georgetown University. He ran his
own Cincinnati law firm, Brown &amp; Gardner Co., for 10 years, but
merged with Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp in 1987, said Circle K
spokesman Ray Cox.
   Circle K operates about 4,600 stores in 32 states.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena Friday
reiterated a warning to the oil cartel's members that they face an
imminent collapse in sagging prices if they continue producing
excessively.
   ``The situation is very serious and I'd say it's alarming if
something is not done immediately to stop the slide in prices,'' he
told a news conference.
   Boussena, Algeria's Mines Minister, arrived in Baghdad Thursday
on the first stop of a tour of Middle East oil producers seeking to
secure adherence to a May 2 Geneva agreement to limit production to
22.1-22.6 million barrels to day and shore up sinking oil prices.
   He had warned the 13-member Organization of Oil Exporting
Countries earlier this month that if they did not stick to the
agreement, prices will drop through the floor as they did in 1986.
   The Nicosia-based Middle East Economic Survey, a respected
weekly oil review, estimated current OPEC production at 23.68
million barrels a day.
   Oil prices have recently slumped to $15 a barrel from OPEC's
benchmark of $18.
   Boussena said the objective of his tour is to study ways of
propping up prices.
   He declined to indentify the OPEC members who are producing more
than their quotas. But the main violators are believed to be Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates.
   Iraq's Oil Minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim Al-Chalabi, did not
hesitate to name the U.A.E. as one of the principal over-producers.
   ``Great harm is being done because the U.A.E. is not part of the
agreement,'' Chalabi told the news conference.
   ``There's no justification whatever for giving away one barrel
free for every three barrels we sell. It's simply unjustifiable and
illogical,'' he said.
   Boussena said: ``We're all suffering great losses. But some of
us are feeling the burden more than others because of their
requirements and their economic and social problems.''
   Boussena ruled out convening an emergency meeting of OPEC oil
ministers to consider the crisis. But he said the next scheduled
meeting on July 26 will do so.
   He said he saw no reason why some members were not abiding by
the agreement.
   ``I'm not convinced by the reasons they give for their
undisciplined behavior. It's simply illogical that they are
overproduciung to sell their oil at cheaper prices while they could
keep it and sell it at higher prices when the market situation
improves,'' he said..
   ``If the organization wants stable prices, then it should have a
solid and durable agreement on production and prices,'' he added.
   But he sounded pessimistic on the prospect of general acceptance
of an agreement.
   ``We only have the solidarity among us to respect our
obligations and to abide by the agreements,'' he added.
   Boussena is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states in the next few days.

   Stock prices were modestly higher at midday
Friday, boosted by reassuring British trade figures.
   Dealers said the trade figures, released late in the morning,
were greeted with a sigh of relief. The figures were largely in

   But since Friday is the last day of a two week trading account
and close to the half-year mark, the data failed to stir many

   London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week and

<HEAD>FCC Action Could Mean Lower Long-Distance Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Communications Commission order that
local phone companies reduce their access charges by $1.1 billion
nationwide is expected to result in a further reduction in
long-distance rates.
   The FCC on Thursday ordered the cut in rates charged to
long-distance companies for access to local phone networks,
effective July 1. Long-distance carriers typically pass along to
their customers savings from such cuts.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the nation's largest
long-distance company, announced last month it would cut its rates
by $160 million annually, effective July 1, in anticipation of the
FCC decision. This would mean a cut of 2.5 percent in typical
evening rates.
   Other phone companies such as MCI Communications Corp. and US
Sprint usually follow suit to remain competitive.
   AT&amp;T has decided on deeper rate reductions, however, since it
had based its cuts on local phone company proposals to the FCC. The
local companies in April had asked to reduce their access charges
by just $405 million on July 1.
   The FCC ordered an additional $696 million cut Thursday, saying
the local phone companies had underestimated likely calling demand
by about 2.4 percent, or 7 billion minutes.
   The FCC also based its rate reductions, in part, on corrections
of the local phone companies' cost estimates.
   ``There will be some further reduction beyond the $160 million
AT&amp;T proposed May 17,'' AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said. ``I don't
know how much. ... But's it's good news for residential and small
business customers.''
   He said AT&amp;T probably would announce additional cuts next week.
   ``We expect AT&amp;T to file reductions in its rates to reflect
these further reductions,'' said Kelly Cameron, an official in the
FCC's common carrier division.
   Cameron said the long-distance price cuts would not necessarily
be a direct flow-through of access charge savings.
   Before July 1989, when AT&amp;T's earnings were restricted to about
a 12 percent rate of return on its investment, the flow-through of
costs generally were nearly automatic.
   But AT&amp;T now is under a regulatory scheme that controls its
prices within a prescribed range tied to the rate of inflation, not
its profits.
   AT&amp;T's May proposal for 2.5 percent evening reductions would
reduce the price of a 10-minute direct-dialed call to anywhere in
the United States to $1.53 or less from $1.58, Sunday through
Friday, 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.
   AT&amp;T's prices have dropped more than 40 percent since 1984.
   Separately Thursday, AT&amp;T began offering corporate phone rates
that match those of its competitors while undercutting rates AT&amp;T
is allowed to charge under its government-approved tariffs.
   A five-month waiting period for the plan under FCC rules expired
at midnight Wednesday, said AT&amp;T spokesman Andy Myers.
   Under the plan, AT&amp;T must seek government approval each time it
signs a contract to offer phone rates to a specific customer that
match those offered to the customer by competitors, and are lower
than AT&amp;T is allowed to offer under its tariffs, Myers said.
   In addition, the FCC has an additional 12 to 15 months to
continue its investigation into the so-called Tariff 15 plan, and
could decide to disallow the plan during that period, said John
Cimko, chief of the FCC's tariff division.
   So far, AT&amp;T has filed seven requests, involving customers such
as CBS Inc. and Pepsico, to offer competitive rates under Tariff
15, Myers said.
   The rate plan that went into effect Thursday is for Resort
Condominiums International Inc. of Indianapolis. Cimko said the
plan, in effect, was a test case for Tariff 15.
   Under FCC rules, AT&amp;T must gain the commission's approval for
all rate changes, while competitors may change rates at will.
However, the FCC has said it will examine whether it should relax
that requirement.

   Firefighters have extinguished a fire at a
Siberian oil tank farm that was ignited by a direct lightning
strike and spread to 22 acres, the evening newspaper Izvestia said
Friday.
   The newspaper said it took firemen a full day to put out the
blaze that engulfed at least four of the oil station's 24 tanks at
the Karkateyevy station, near Nefteyugansk in the Tyumen oil region
of Western Siberia.
   The Tass news agency said on Thursday that the reservoirs at the
station contain a total of 380,000 tons of oil. It said 160 firemen
used 28 pieces of equipment to douse the blaze.
   No one was injured in the blaze and evacuation of the area was
not necessary, Izvestia said.
   According to the regional executive committee, negligence was
partly to blame for the blaze, which broke out Wednesday night.
   ``Lightning rods were not working, and there was no special foam
to extinguish the blaze,'' it said. ``Also, taps on the pipes were
not working and oil was going through them while they were
burning.''
   The newspaper did not give any estimate of damage or oil loss
from the blaze.

<TEXT>
   A cutback in bank lending for commercial real
estate construction and corporate mergers hasn't harmed the economy
as a whole, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says.
   ``With the exception, perhaps, of the troublesome situation in
the New England region, credit availability more broadly appears
not to be significantly impaired,'' Greenspan told the Senate
Banking Committee on Thursday.
   ``Enough credit appears to be available to fuel'' economic
growth nationally, he said. But he also warned, ``significant
problems cannot be ruled out in the period ahead.''
   ``We are attentive to the possibility that this more cautios
stance in the granting of credit could cumulate to threaten the
economic expansion,'' Greenspan said.
   Although fewer loans are being made to finance construction and
mergers, the caution was justified by deteriorating conditions in
those areas and was not a result of a crackdown by bank examiners,
the central bank chief said.
   Greenspan was disputed by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher
who issued a statement to the committee, saying, ``While real
estate lending has been especially slow this year, other lending
has also been reduced. ... Especially hard-hit have been small- and
medium-sized businesses.''
   He added: ``While the credit problem differs by region, it
appears to be national in scope.'' Substantial credit is essential
for U.S. firms to meet the challenge of foreign competition, he
said.
   At the same time, a senior Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
official warned that commercial real estate difficulties were
spreading beyond New England and the Southwest and were likely to
get worse before they get better.
   ``We do expect some continuing slowing and softness in the real
estate markets,'' said Paul G. Fritts, FDIC director of bank
supervision. ``We don't think it's bottomed out in New England yet.
We see some softness beginning to develop in California.''
   Greenspan sought to reassure worried New England lawmakers, as
well as senators from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida, who said
business people in their areas are reporting great difficulty
getting loans for what they consider credit-worthy projects.
   Some examiners and bankers may have turned overly cautious,
Greenspan said, but ``whatever overreaction that may have occurred
does not appear to have been widespread.''
   ``Access to credit has not been reduced to an extent that it has
had a dampening influence on the American economy overall,'' he
said.
   However, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, D-Mass., who appeared before
the Senate panel as a witness, said, ``Many bankers and people in
the business community say that, while regulators may not have
caused the economic downturn, they sure have greased the pole.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,said residents of the Northeast are
effectively paying for the savings and loan crisis twice. They are
paying for 47 percent of the bailout, while only 10 percent of the
costs are attributed to S&amp;L failures in the region, he said.
   Now, regulators are being too tough on institutions in the
Northeast for fear of repeating the mistakes they made in the
Southwest, Kerry said.
   However, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on the
Banking Committee, warned against criticizing regulators too
harshly, noting that they were pressured to ease up when economic
trouble first hit savings and loans in the Southwest.
   ``Let's be careful. You don't have to have a long memory to
remember that we went through this before,'' he said. ``... This
senator, if he has to err, will err on the side of tougher
regulation.''

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
following through on Thursday's late rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.15 to 2,911.88
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 637 up, 292
down and 523 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.09 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said money managers at investing institutions were
intent on building up their stock holdings as they prepare to make
midyear reports to employers and clients.
   This effect, which is often hard to document, is commonly
referred to on Wall Street as ``window dressing.''
   Otherwise, stocks drew no strong message from the bond market,
where interest rates were little changed in early activity.
   The market also appeared to take in stride a Commerce Department
report that new factory orders for durable goods rose 3.9 percent
in May after falling 4.2 percent the month before.
   The gain in the latest month was attributed largely to orders
for transportation equipment, specifically cars and aircraft.
   Philip Morris gained 1&lsqb; to 45{. The company announced plans to
expand its already vast consumer products business by acquiring the
Swiss coffee and candy conglomerate Jacobs Suchard for about $3.8
billion.
   Intermec tumbled 3} to 12{ in the over-the-counter market. The
company said its earnings for the fiscal quarter ending June 30
would be significantly depressed by moving costs and weakness in
sales to the Defense Department.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed .70 to 197.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the maret
value index was up .08 at 360.30.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.43 to
2,901.73.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 769 up, 681 down and 551 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 138.57 million shares, against 137.42

<HEAD>FTC Clears Way For Dayton Hudson-Marshall Field's Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has cleared the
way for Dayton Hudson Corp. to acquire Marshall Field &amp; Co. for
about $1.05 billion, Dayton Hudson announced Friday.
   The proposed takeover was being examined under federal antitrust
law, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification Act. The FTC did
not issue an opinion on the merger, it merely said the waiting
period was over, said Ann Barkelew, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson.
   The two retailers expected to complete the deal Friday, she
said. The Marshall Field stores will become part of the department
store division of Dayton Hudson.
   ``This was an opportunity to acquire a premier name in American
retailing,'' said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive
officer of Dayton Hudson.
   But he noted that the department store chains of Target and
Mervyn's will ``continue to be our primary growth vehicles.''
   Macke said announcements will be made early next week about
operational and personnel changes at Chicago-based Marshall
Field's. Gary Witkin, Marshall Field's former executive vice
president of stores, has been named president of the Field's unit.
   Field Chairman Philip B. Miller and President Burnett W. Donoho
announced their resignations the day after Dayton Hudson announced
in late April that it would consolidate Field's administrative and
buying operations in Minneapolis.
   Macke said the impact of the acquisition on Dayton Hudson's
bottom line in 1990 ``is not expected to be material.''
   Dayton Hudson's department store division's 1989 revenues were
$1.8 billion and its operating profit totaled $179 million. Prior
to the acquisition, the division had more than 22,000 employees and
37 stores. With the acquisition, the division will employ more than
31,000 people and operate 61 stores.
   Marshall Field's, sold by BAT Industries PLC as part of a
restructuring, had revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Supercomputers Heat up Pace in Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The supercomputer is making a move on the credit
markets.
   The profusion of ever more complex fixed-income instruments is
forcing Wall Street investment banks to add high-powered silicon to
their arsenals.
   The workstation has replaced the primitive yield calculator as
the bond trader's standard tool. And increasingly, that workstation
is backed up by the power of a supercomputer, or mini-super, with
the number-crunching power to assess the impact of interest rate
shifts on individual bonds or portfolios containing dozens of bonds.
   ``We're in a technical business, there's no doubt about it,''
says Tony Vignola, head of fixed-income research at Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co. ``The capability of analyzing and processing information
quickly is becoming an ever increasing means of staying competitive
in the business.''
   Technology's biggest inroads have been in the field of
mortgage-backed securities, whose complex structures demand raw
computing power.
   These securities represent packages of thousands of individual
mortgages, some fixed-rate and some variable, with different
pre-payment risks. What's more, the securities often are packaged
further into structures like collateralized mortgage obligations,
or CMOs, which group bonds in tiers of increasing risk and compound
the complexity.
   ``Basically, all the value is in the details, and there are
zillions of details,'' says Vincent Pica, co-head of institutional
strategies at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Pru-Bache last year bought a low-end supercomputer from Intel
Corp. and recently upgraded the machine using the company's latest
high-speed computer chip.
   The iPSC@860, or hypercube as it's called, helps the investment
bank to design new mortgage bond structures and to assess
securities in the secondary market.
   The machine can evaluate how the bottom tier of a CMO will
perform under scores of interest rate scenarios in about 90
seconds, compared with about 20 minutes for a desktop workstation,
Pica says. Entire portfolio analyses that used to be done overnight
now can be crunched out during the trading day.
   That speed means business, whether it's spotting a market
opportunity for the firm or finding a trade for a client while the
client waits on the phone.
   ``The race is to the swift,'' Pica says.
   Elliot Swan, manager of Intel's sales to the financial services
industry, says the company has targeted its sales effort at up to
200 large investment banks, insurance companies and other
institutional heavyweights.
   ``Everyone is overwhelmed with data,'' Swan says. ``Making sense
of the data is really what this is all about.''
   The state of the Street's technology can be hard to gauge, says
Gary Smaby, who runs a research firm in Minneapolis that bears his
name. The hardware itself, plus the applications software that
allows bankers to manipulate bond data, is guarded jealously by
firms seeking a competitive edge, he says.
   ``We don't want to discuss what we're doing for competitive
reasons,'' says Peter Roche, a spokesman at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   The recent squeeze on Wall Street's earnings may be slowing the
spread of high-priced supercomputers. Pru-Bache declined to say
what it spent on its hypercube. Intel says the machine ranges from
$250,000 to $3 million, with the most likely Wall Street model
selling for around $1 million.
   Union Bank of Switzerland has invested about $450,000 in a
low-powered hypercube at its New York securities operation in the
past year, says Christian Gabathuler, the bank's U.S. head of
information systems. The bank has used the machine only for
research but hopes to put it to work in its credit market
operations by the end of the year, he says.
   More common are so-called mini-supercomputers, says Smaby. They
don't offer the computing speed of a true super, but they cost much
less and can handle complex bond calculations many times faster
than a workstation.
   Torque Computer Inc. sells a sort of turbocharged box for about
$100,000 that can increase a workstation's computing speed as much
as 50 times, says Sam Bogoch, the company's president.
   ``You literally turn hours into minutes,'' he says.
   That kind of power is fast becoming indispensable in Wall
Street's race to design more exotic bonds and find extra basis
points of yield.
   As Pica says of Pru-Bache's supercomputer, ``One year from now,
we're all going to look back and say, `How did intelligent life
exist without this thing.'''

<HEAD>Nissan Setting Up Dealers in East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. on Friday began selling
passenger and commercial vehicles in East Germany, the first
Japanese automaker to do so through its own dealers, a company
spokesman said.
   Kenkichi Shibata said the move followed sales and service
contracts signed recently between Nissan Motor Deutschland GmbH,
the company's wholly owned distributor in West Germany.
   Thirty-six Nissan dealerships officially opened Friday, and that
number is expected to expand to 60 or 70 by year's end.
   Prior to the establishment of Nissan's East German dealer
network, Japanese automakers have exported a small number of cars
to the country.
   He said Nissan is targeting its sales of new cars in East
Germany at 2,000 vehicles for the first year. The company currently
sells about 100,000 cars and trucks through its 800-dealer network
in West Germany.
   The company said the establishment of Nissan dealerships in East
Germany was to accommodate the service needs of Nissan owners from
the West. The number of visitors traveling to East Germany has been
increasing since the removal of travel restrictions. Subsidiaries
of Nissan Motor Deutschland, have set up offices in East Berlin to
provide finance and leasing services.
   Six Nissan models to be sold in East Germany include Micra,
Sunny and Bluebird passenger cars, Patrol, Vanette and Urvan
commercial vehicles, he said.
   The Micra is a minicar not sold in the United States. The U.S.
equivalent of the Sunny is the Sentra and the Bluebird is the
Stanza. The Patrol, made in Spain, is similar to the Pathfinder
sport-utility vehicle, the Vanette is a minivan and the Urvan is a
commercial vehicle slightly larger than a Vanette.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Garfinckel's, one of the Washington area's
oldest upscale retailers, will lay off a fourth of its employees,
close seven department stores and open two smaller specialty stores
for women.
   The retailer announced the changes Thursday after filing for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Columbia.
   ``Garfinckel's existing business structure cannot produce either
the merchandising mix or financial performance for the company to
viably serve its customers or meet its debt obligations,'' George
P. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of Garfinckel's
said. ``Garfinckel's does not have the economies of scale, given
its reduced revenue base and market share since 1987, to be a
competitive retailer in this marketplace.''
   The retailer is owned by an investment group headed by Middle
Eastern investor Wafic Said. Said also owns a major stake in
Washington Bancorporation, the parent company of the troubled
National Bank of Washington.
   In recent years, Garfinckel's had been struggling to overcome
changes in ownership, a heavy debt burden taken on to prevent a
leveraged buyout and competition from other large stores such as
Seattle-based Nordstrom Inc., that have come to the Washington area.
   A spokesperson for the company, who asked to remain anonymous,
said 200 of the company's 850 employees will be laid off
immediately.
   Garfinckel's nine stores, all located in the metropolitan
Washington area, will remain open through an inventory liquidation
process, the spokesperson said. The liquidation process, which will
take about 60 days, will be directed by Schottenstein Stores Corp.,
officials said.
   The company will sell their leases on seven of the stores and
will seek to reorganize and open two smaller specialty stores for
women. Those stores will be located in prestigious Georgetown Park
and Connecticut Avenue.
   A release issued by Kelly Thursday said the consumers'
preference for specialty stores apparently led to the company's
demise along with numerous changes in ownership.
   ``Changing ownership five times since the early 1980s subjected
Garfinckel's to different marketing strategies so that its image
among customers became significantly impaired,'' Kelly said. ``This
was compounded by the deterioriating condition of the retailing
industry generally following a number of recent bankruptcies.''
   Garfinckel's Holding Co. is the parent company of Garfinckel's.
The store currently has locations in Washington and suburban
Maryland and Virginia.
   Garfinckel's once was a division of Allied Stores Corp. It was
sold after the 1986 acquisition of Allied by Canada's Campeau Corp.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower after a mixed opening today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting expectations for drier weather next week in the
rain-weary Midwest.
   Abundant, and in some areas excessive, rain has delayed planting
of soybeans and washed away some newly planted corn in the past
week.
   But conditions are expected to turn drier next week and traders
generally believe crop conditions overall are improving, said
Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain-trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But he said farmers have little time left to get soybeans into
the ground without risking yield losses.
   ``This is it, this is the crunch time right now,'' Lespinasse
said. ``It's now or never.''
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were unchanged to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.38{ a bushel;
corn futures were 1 cent lower to } cent higher with July at $2.84
a bushel; oats were { cent to 3\ cents lower with July at $1.37{ a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2\ cents lower with July at
$6.01 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as slack demand for pork continued to exert pressure on
prices.
   Live cattle futures were .07 cent to .58 cent lower with August
at 73.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .37 cent
lower with August at 85.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with August at 57.30 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.9 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
lower with July at 59.40 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on Thursday while pork futures
retreated.

   An undercover FBI agent in a wide-ranging probe
of corruption at the world's biggest commodities exchanges was ``no
bumpkin,'' a federal prosecutor said today in concluding his case
against three traders.
   Randall Jannett, who posed as a corrupt trader at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, was ``a special, special agent'' who
accurately recalled how the three men _ all traders in the Swiss
franc pit _ cheated their customers, Assistant U.S. Attorney James
P. Fleissner told jurors at the U.S. District trial before Judge
Ann C. Williams.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, Randall Jannett was no bumpkin,''
Fleissner said.
   Defense attorneys for the defendants, Robert D. Mosky, Danny
Scheck and David Zatz, argued throughout the six-week trial that
Jannett was in over his head, incompetent at discerning what were
and were not legitimate trades.
   Thursday, Mosky's attorney, Elliot Samuels, told the 12-member
jury that his client was being unfairly blamed for ambiguous
trading rules at the commodities exchanges.
   Federal prosecutors contend Mosky was the ringleader of a group
of traders in the Merc's Swiss franc futures pit who routinely
stole money from customers through various illegal trading schemes
that prevented the customer orders from being executed in the open
market.
   But Samuels, backed by testimony from a Merc official, contended
a key trading rule that Mosky allegedly broke is subject to
interpretation according to the customs and practices of the
marketplace.
   ``Here's the (government's) game, folks: let's call the conduct
fraudulent, and let's indict the guy,'' Samuels told the jury near
the end of his two-hour closing argument.
   ``If they're not happy with the damn rules, let them go to
Washington and get Congress to change it _ but don't Bob put Mosky
in jail because of it,'' Samuels said.
   Congress already is addressing the vagueness of some commodity
trading rules as part of a periodic examination of the industry
that has taken on added weight after the Chicago corruption probe.
   Samuels referred specifically to the interpretation of ``open
outcry'' trading, the accepted method of commodity futures trading
in which traders crowd into recessed ``pits'' to buy and sell
contracts for future deliveries of commodities through a
combination of hand signals and shouted bids and offers.
   The federal charges are rooted in the premise that the
defendants executed customer orders through pre-arranged or
off-market trades instead of through open outcry, thus depriving
the customers of the supposedly superior prices that result from
competitive trading.
   The government contends the defendants used the profits from the
illegal trades to cover their personal losses from trading errors.
   Samuels cited the testimony of Merc Executive Vice President
Gerald Beyer, who indicated during cross-examination that the
precise definition of a legitimate bid or offer _ whether a
wordless hand gesture is sufficient, for example _ depends on the
customs of each trading pit.
   Samuels said the government had not proved that Mosky had not
executed customer orders through open outcry. Samuels suggested
undercover FBI agent Randall Jannett merely missed Mosky's legal
trades, then mistook the ensuing confirmation discussion between
the traders as illegal, off-market trading.
   This is the first trial resulting from an unprecedented
undercover FBI probe of corruption at the Merc and the Chicago
Board of Trade, the world's two biggest commodity exchanges. In
all, 48 people were indicted and 16 already have pleaded guilty.
   Two other groups of traders face September trials.
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz face more than a dozen counts each of
mail or wire fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
$150,000 fine.
   Mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy, for which he
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit
personal assets, including exchange membership.

   The stock market headed higher today, following
through on Thursday's late rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.43 to 2,909.16 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 713 up, 554 down and

   Analysts said money managers at investing institutions were
intent on building up their stock holdings as they prepare to make

   The market also appeared to take in stride a Commerce Department
report that new factory orders for durable goods rose 3.9 percent

   The gain in the latest month was attributed largely to orders
for transportation equipment, specifically cars and aircraft.
   Philip Morris rose 1~ to 46\ in heavy trading. The company

   In the latest change among top
executives at Apple Computer Inc., the company announced that
William B. Coldrick, who had been senior vice president of sales
for Apple USA, has left the post to become a part-time adviser to
the president of the unit.
   Coldrick, 47, will work on strategic issues and special
projects. He said Thursday he left his full-time post in order to
spend more time with his family.
   Michael L. Dionne, 41, will succeed Coldrick in the top U.S.
sales post. Dionne was vice president of Southwestern operations
for Apple USA.
   A year ago, Apple gave Coldrick a compensation package worth
$2.1 million a year to keep him at the company when he was
considering going to a competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported
Friday.
   Apple is still looking for a president for Apple USA, five
months after Michael Spindler, Apple's chief operating officer,
became acting president of the unit upon the resignation of former
President Allan Z. Loren. Coldrick said Apple USA would have a new
president soon.
   Also earlier this year, Apple's new-products developer,
Jean-Louis Gassee, left the company.

   President Bush, accused by members of Congress
of being too sluggish on enforcement of savings and loan fraud,
today asked lawmakers to double spending for the crackdown.
   ``We will not rest until the cheats and the chiselers and the
charlatans spend a large chunk of their lives behind the bars of a
federal prison,'' Bush said in a speech to U.S. attorneys at the
Justice Department.
   The president also announced his support for an amendment to
pending crime legislation that would devote more Internal Revenue
Service and Justice Department investigators and prosecutors to
financial fraud cases.
   Bush is asking Congress to increase next year's spending from
the current $50 million to $100 million in the 1991 budget year.
For 1990, the administration sought and received only $50 million,
even though Congress had authorized $75 million.
   Bush also announced he was establishing a new position in the
attorney general's office, a special counsel for financial
institution fraud who will coordinate investigations and
prosecutions in that area.
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats lashed out at the president's
initiative as inadequate.
   ``It's too little and woefully late,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking Committee. He said
$100 million may have been enough for 1990, but it is not enough
for 1991.
   ``The administration is now moving only because the political
heat is up,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Bush said his administration is sending out ``teams of razor
sharp prosecutors and auditors, recruited from their departments
and other agencies, striking city by city, teams that will jump
right into the paper chase, teams that will hit the trail while
that trail is still hot.''
   Bush was criticized by members of Congress this year for failing
to take advantage of the full $75 million they authorized last
August when they passed the savings and loan bailout package.
Congress subsequently appropriated only the $50 million Bush had
asked for.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the administration could
not use the full $75 million during the startup phase of the
intensified S$L crackdown, but in the fiscal year 1991 wants to
spend $100 million.
   In addition to beefing up the investigative and prosecutorial
forces, the administration's legislative package would authorize
wiretaps in bank fraud and financial fraud cases; freezing of
personal and corporate assets of civil defendants in financial
fraud cases and barring use of bankruptcy to avoid damages and
penalties in these cases.
   Among those under investigation by thrift regulators is Bush's
son, Neil Bush of Denver, a former director of Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan, one of the failed associations involved in the
S&amp;L probe.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater on Thursday
defended the administration's anti-fraud efforts. Democratic
critics have complained that the Justice Department has a backlog
of nearly 7,000 cases.
   Fitzwater said last year there were 791 convictions for
financial institution fraud involving losses of $100,000 each.
Since 1987, he said, the government has issued 184 major S&amp;L
indictments with 159 convictions.
   The Justice Department has 530 failed institutions under
investigation, up from 282 three years ago, Fitzwater said.
   With the $50 million already appropriated for this fiscal year,
the Justice Department is hiring 368 new employees, including 202
FBI agents and 120 prosecutors.
   The department says it is creating special offices in 27 cities
to go after financial institution fraud.
   Congressional critics pointed out, however, that U.S. attorneys'
offices around the country asked for an additional 231 prosecutors
and FBI field offices asked for more than 400 additional agents.
   Criticism on Capitol Hill has mounted with the administration's
announcement a month ago that the S&amp;L cleanup costs would be far
greater than originally thought.
   The estimates now range from $89 billion to $132 billion, and
officials have said the administration would need from $30 billion
to more than $50 billion more in the next fiscal year alone.
   Fitzwater this week lashed out at Democrats who he said are
trying to politicize the savings and loan issue. He said many
Democratic lawmakers share the blame for the debacle, which
mushroomed during the Reagan administration years. Bush said he
approved of Fitzwater's statements.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trading
assistant Lisa Jones was sentenced today to 10 months in prison for
lying to the government during its investigation of the Wall Street
firm.
   The punishment was eight months less than Jones received at her
original sentencing last year. That term was thrown out by a
federal appeals court that said the sentence was longer than
prescribed by federal sentencing guidelines.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand also ordered the one-time
teen-age runaway who climbed to a $100,000-a-year job at Drexel to
pay $25,000 in fines plus the cost of her incarceration.
   Jones, 27, was convicted by a federal jury in March 1989 of
seven counts of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a
federal grand jury investigating trading activities at Drexel.
   She was the first person convicted in the government's lengthy
investigation of fraud on Wall Street.
   Prosecutors showed at her trial that Jones handled transactions
that constituted illegal ``stock parking,'' which involves hiding
the true ownership of securities. Jones had denied any knwowledge
of such transactions.
   Jones worked at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond
department as a trading assistant to Bruce Newberg, who was
convicted last year of parking and other charges and sentenced to
three months in prison.
   Newberg reported directly to Michael Milken, the ex-head of
Drexel's junk bond department who pleaded guilty to six felonies
earlier this year to settle wide-ranging securities fraud charges.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March ruled that Sand
wrongly gave Jones a sentence greater than the 10- to 16-month term
recommended by new sentencing guidelines governing crimes that
occurred after January 1987.
   Sand originally had added on to the term on grounds that Jones'
perjury had severly impeded the government's Drexel investigation.
   Sand said today that Jones' perjury was ``not a sudden impulse.
It was a persistent conduct of perjury on several occasions despite
warnings'' from the government.
   Jones, who sobbed throughout the 90-minute sentencing, was
ordered to continue to receive mental health therapy during her
term. She is to report to a minimum-security prison camp in Phoenix
in 30 days.

   More than 3,000 GTE Northwest telephone
company workers in three states went on strike for higher wages
today after talks on a new contract broke down, union and company
officials said.
   Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
walked off the job shortly after midnight in Washington, Oregon and
northern California, said Douglas Weisner, business manager for
Local 89.
   The bulk of the more than 3,100 affected GTE workers are in
Washington and Oregon. They include telephone cable installers,
splicers, operators and clerical workers.
   No new talks are scheduled, and pickets were up this morning at
many GTE sites, said GTE spokeswoman Linda Gainer.
   Union and company negotiators met for several hours Thursday but
failed to reach an agreement, Weisner said. Employees had been
working under extended provisions of a contract that expired May 26.
   The union rejected a three-year offer earlier this week by 72
percent, Weisner said.
   Weisner said the company's latest offer included an 8 percent
wage hike over three years, with a $270 ratification bonus for each
employee. The union has been seeking an 11.5 percent wage increase
over three years.
   Gainer said the company was disappointed at the strike and
believes it made significant changes in the latest offer. In
addition to the ratification bonus, she said, GTE agreed to some
union demands on job and pay classifications.
   The phone company serves more than 672,000 customers in the
three states. Most existing customers should only experience minor
inconveniences, such as longer waits for operators, Gainer said.
   ``So much of our service is mechanized that the impact is not as
intensive as it would have been in the old days,'' she said.
   GTE has 1,300 management employees working seven-day, 12-hour
shifts, Gainer said. It also is bringing in 350 management
employees from California and 100 retirees to help out, she said.

   Creditors of Allegheny International Inc. have
defeated a New York investment firm's plan for putting the
small-appliance maker back on its feet.
   That means U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Joseph L. Cosetti will
proceed with a June 28 hearing on the company's reorganization
plan, despite pleas from the firm, Japonica Partners, and bank
creditors who want more time to settle their differences and come
up with a plan that can be approved.
   Japonica, which has purchased millions of dollars of the
company's creditor claims, told Cosetti that creditors had rejected
its $661 million reorganization plan.
   The plan was approved overwhelmingly by the classes of creditors
Japonica holds controlling interest in _ unsecured creditors and
subordinated debtholders. But opposition from bank creditors and
common stockholders was enough to derail the plan.
   Joy Flowers Conti, a lawyer representing the banks, said
proceeding with Allegheny International's $687 million plan will
spark extensive litigation among the company, Japonica and creditor
groups.
   But Cosetti said Thursday that allowing Japonica and the banks
more time to negotiate a settlement would only delay the day it
emerges from bankruptcy.
   Allegheny International, the maker of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in February 1988. Eight of its
reorganization plans have been scuttled.

   Philip Morris Cos. will acquire the Swiss coffee
and chocolate giant Jacobs Suchard AG in a deal valued at about
$3.8 billion, the companies announced today.
   Separately, the Zurich Stock Exchange is considering opening an
insider trading investigation involving Suchard stock. Press
reports outlining the deal circulated Thursday while the market was
still open. A spokesman for Suchard said the board has begun its
own investigation into the possibility that information may have
been leaked.
   The combination, which will link Suchard with Philip Morris's
Kraft General Foods International unit, will create one of the
largest coffee and confectionery companies in the world.
   Under the agreement announced in Zurich, Philip Morris will
acquire Colima Holding AG, which holds a 60 percent stake in
Suchard. Colima is owned by Suchard Chairman and Chief Executive
Klaus Jacobs, whose stake in Suchard has been valued at about $1.4
billion at current exchange rates.
   Philip Morris, through Colima, would then launch a cash tender
offer for all the publicly traded Suchard shares. The Suchard board
has recommended shareholders accept the offer.
   Not included are certain assets that the Suchard board has
agreed to sell to Jacobs. Those assets are described by the
companies as ``not completely (fitting) in the new structure.''
They include Suchard's Canadian subsidiary, its E.J. Brach Inc.
candy subsidiary, its industrial chocolate business and equity
interests in certain foreign banks.
   ``This is a major opportunity for all of the parties _
consumers, customers and employees _ to build one of the best
global coffee and confectonery business,'' said Jacobs, who will
continue as Suchard's chairman but not its chief executive.
   Philip Morris spokeswoman Alice McGillion said Suchard would
operate as a separate company within Kraft General Foods
International. Last year Kraft General Foods International's
revenues from European operations topped $3 billion.
   The Suchard acquisiton ``will permit us to more effectively
compete throughout Europe with excellent brands and broad
distribution and manufacturing capabilities,'' said Hamish Maxwell,
chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris, the tobacco and
foods conglomerate.
   Rumors that Suchard was a takeover target have been circulating
for weeks on the Swiss stock market, where Suchard shares have been
pushed higher in active trading. Details of the deal surfaced
Thursday in an article that appeared today in the Swiss weekly
financial newspaper Cash.
   According to Cash, Klaus Jacobs had amassed a personal debt of
nearly $500 million since he bought out his siblings' interests in
the company last year.
   In addition, the company has experienced management and
marketing difficulties at its Brachs unit, which ran up an
operating loss of $50 million in 1989. The loss at the U.S. unit
weighed on Suchard's group profit, which fell 10 percent last year
to $194.6 million on sales of $4.7 billion.
   In addition, Suchard confirmed in April that it was considering
slashing about 3,000 jobs _ or 19 percent of its work force in an
effort to cut costs.
   At a press conference in April, Klaus Jacobs disclosed that the
company was searching for possible alliances to help accelerate its
plans to expand in various markets. He declined to identify any
potential partners.
   Both he and analysts have predicted substantial improvement in
the company's profit picture this year, and the Brachs unit is
expected to break even.
   Among Suchard's prominent confectionery products are Tobler,
Toblerone, Cote d'Or, Milka, Suchard and Night and Day coffee.
   The alliance with Philip Morris is expected to provide stiffer
competition for Suchard's main competitors _ Nestle SA and
Britain's Cadbury Schweppes.
   Jack Keenan, president of Kraft General Foods International,
said he hoped ``currenct Jacobs Suchard managers will remain to
participate in the global expansion of the combined businesses.''
   Philip Morris, with 157,000 employees worldwide, makes Maxwell
House coffee, Miller beer, Jello-O, Oscar Mayer processed meats and
Kraft cheeses, mayonnaise and salad dressings. In addition, Philip
Morris holds 7.5 percent of the world cigarette market.
   Headquartered in New York, Philip Morris reported a $2.9 billion
profit last year on operating revenues of $44.8 billion.

   Technology has been a major reason for the
United States' success in the world agriculture market, but this
country risks losing its prominence, experts said at a conference.
   ``The day has passed when American agriculture had a lock on the
world marketplace for food,'' U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said.
   He joined international food experts, scholars and businessmen
in Indianapolis in April to discuss global food trends during the
1990s at a conference sponsored by the conservative think tank
Hudson Institute.
   The United States held 35 percent of the value of world trade in
bulk agriculture commodities in 1988, Yeutter said, but in
intermediate products such as flours and vegetable fats, the U.S.
share dropped to 18 percent. Among consumer-oriented agriculture
products, such as processed fruits, cut flowers and bakery
products, American farmers have less than a 6 percent stake.
   In the past year Eastern Europe has begun moving toward free
market systems. That won't help American farmers, but it may be a
windfall for food processors, one analyst said.
   Richard Judy, a Soviet specialist at the Hudson Institute, said
there will be a demand for companies involved in food processing
and marketing.
   One of them is Central Soya, based in Fort Wayne. Since January
it has formed joint ventures with Hungary's state-owned
agribusiness concern to produce livestock feed and with a
Yugoslavian company to produce soybean concentrates used in meat
processing.
   Bioprocessing represents another opportunity. Genetically
engineered microorganisms will be used to produce food, fuel,
industrial feedstocks and commodity chemicals from corn, sugar cane
and other crops, said John R. Campbell, president of Oklahoma State
University.
   However, such products may meet resistance, including consumer
fears.
   ``Technology has been one of the major reasons for the success
in American agriculture,'' said John Urbanchek, a senior vice
president for economics in the Washington office of the consulting
firm Hill and Knowlton Inc.
   ``The problem is that the contribution of current technology is
being rapidly exhausted and must be replaced if the U.S. is to
retain its prominence as an agricultural producer and exporter, and
to continue to supply American consumers with high-quality, safe
and reasonably priced food,'' he said.
   Duane Acker, a former agriculture official with the U.S. Agency
for International Development, said this country's system of
research and farm extension once was the envy of the world,
accounting for an estimated 75 percent of the public funds invested
in that area.
   Today, estimates place that figure at 25 percent or less, Acker
said.
   ``Though we continue to brag about our excellent system, we no
longer have a corner on knowledge or technology,'' said Acker, now
an administrator at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   To help the United States attain a ``globally oriented and
internationally competitive'' agriculture system by the year 2000,
Acker called for investment in agriculture research, links with
gene banks and research institutions around the world, and U.S.
investment in developing countries.

   Excalibur Automobile Corp., manufacturer of
neoclassic automobiles fancied by wealthy collectors, has suspended
production after being rocked by layoffs, lawsuits, bounced
paychecks and allegations of mileage tampering.
   The suburban Milwaukee company, whose cars feature a minimum
price tag of $75,000, hopes the restructuring will raise enough
capital to move forward with a planned venture in Japan.
   ``Almost everybody likes to be part of Excalibur and the cars
and the lifestyle image,'' said Scott Dennison, who took over as
president June 1 after the resignation of Henry A. Warner.
   ``If we could build 120 cars a year, we could be profitable.
We're really not in the car business, we're in the toy business,''
Dennison said.
   The company has been producing its 1930s-style cars at a rate of
just one per week since January and has a backlog of 76 vehicles.
   Employees, incensed by unpaid wages, about 40 layoffs and
allegations the company used old parts in new cars, picketed the
company this week, threatening to set back any rebound by the
27-year-old company.
   Only five of the company's 45 workers remain on staff after the
layoffs this month.
   ``We've used up just about all the tolerance we had,'' said Dan
Neilson, a laid-off technician and one o the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been
staunchly opposed.
   West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is a
member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the
strength of the German armed forces and ``to revamp their structure
to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive
operations.''
   It said those reductions could be undertaken over a three-year
period. Germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying
chemmical or nuclear weapons.
   It also said that within six months of unification, all Western
troops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically under
military occupation by the United States, France and Britian.
   The four nations would reduce their military forces in the
country during a three-year period following unification first by
50 percent, then ``bring them down to a level of token contingents,
or completely withdraw them from Germany.''
   There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, while a
quarter-million U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany along
with tens of thousands of British and French soldiers.
   Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in what
is now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear the
exact plans for pulling them out.
   Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of
the Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four
Powers' troops out of ``greater Berlin'' within six months after
unification.
   The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and
distributed to the news media, apparently would also include the
Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper.
   The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated
12,000 troops in West Berlin. An official reached by telephone in
the office of the military attache at the Soviet embassy in East
Berlin said there were no Soviet troops stationed in the city
proper.

   Crop futures prices closed moderately lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts for drier weather
in the Midwest prompted some profit-taking after strong gains
during the week.
   Drier conditions would allow farmers to finish soybean planting,
which has been delayed by excessive rain in some of the most
productive soybean regions, notably parts of Illinois and Missouri.
   The general perception among traders, though, is that crop
conditions overall are improving, analysts said.
   William Biedermann, research director with the futures brokerage

commodity investment funds. But he said the corn and soybean
markets were underpinned by strong support among grain handlers.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 4\ cents lower to { cent

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Take a ride around Austin these days and
you're likely to spot a bunch of college students tossing white
towels in the air.
   No, it's not some fraternity or sorority prank. They're
imitating pizza-dough tossing to help generate business for HWY
Pizza, a fledgling company that takes carry-out to new heights of
convenience.
   Without ever leaving their cars, motorists can buy ready-to-bake
pizzas for $4.95 from one of 11 roadside carts.
   Businessman Kerry Wood, 37, started the business with about
$40,000 in late 1988, after first having the idea researched by
University of Texas graduate students.
   But Wood said he already had a pretty good idea about the people
who would buy many of his pizzas: working women between the ages of
24 and 49, with children.
   ``I think we knew this prior to the study that it was real
attractive to working mothers because of the convenience of picking
it up, and the fact that they're doing it (cooking) at home and the
children like to help make it,'' said Wood, a Lima, Ohio, native.
   ``It's a lot of fun for them to make it. It becomes their
dinner, and a way to help mom out,'' he said.
   Wood said he gets calls almost every day from customers praising
the time-saving product.
   The basic pizza kit includes a 14-inch crust in an oven-ready,
disposable pan, tomato sauce and cheese. Each extra ingredient _
pepperoni, black and green olives, jalapenos, mushrooms, Canadian
bacon, hamburger and Italian sausage _ is 50 cents.
   One pizza will ``feed a husband, wife and two small children,''
Wood said.
   Wood estimates that about 110,000 pizzas have been sold since
the business opened about 18 months ago. His pizza carts are open
from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week.
   Wood said he plans to open a 12th cart in July, and eventually
expand his business statewide. He's also hoping for a nationwide
franchise in about 10 years.
   ``I think it would work well in the Northern states, more so
than in Austin, because you're taking it home and you're cooking it
yourself,'' he said. ``A lot of times, (Austin residents) just
don't want to fire up the oven when it's 100 degrees outside.''
   For now, the biggest problem Wood seems to face is getting
people to try his pizza. He's had limited success with radio,
television and billboard ads.
   The curb-side towel-throwing gimmick, while cute, didn't always
work, especially when the tossers sometimes drop them on the
pavement.
   ``(Customers) thought we were making them out on the street,''
Wood said. ``They have a tendency to think we might be making them
in the back of our garage instead of in a health-approved
commissary under the conditions that we have.
   ``We make them fresh every day, handmade. It's the freshest
product that you can sell to the public.''
   Wood said he solved the mistaken identity problem by bordering
the ``phony dough'' towels in red.

<HEAD>Court Reinstates Suit Against Oil Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today reinstated a
potential multibillion-dollar lawsuit by the states of California,
Arizona, Oregon and Washington that accuses oil companies of
conspiring to fix prices and contrive a gasoline shortage in the
early 1970s.
   The suit against seven major companies was dismissed in 1986 by
U.S. District Judge William Gray of Los Angeles, who said the
states had failed to present evidence of a conspiracy in violation
of antitrust laws.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 decision,
said today that evidence of information exchanges and parallel
actions by the companies would allow a jury to find that a
conspiracy existed.
   The ruling, if it stands, would send the case to trial. Robert
Mittelstaedt, a lawyer for Chevron Corp., said no decision had been
reached yet on whether to appeal.
   Expressing surprise at the ruling, Mittelstaedt said, ``We fully
expect to win at trial, if it comes to that.''
   The case is separate from another antitrust lawsuit by
California that accuses six major oil companies of conspiring to
depress the price of oil they pumped from state-owned tidelands in
Long Beach. Gray's dismissal of that suit was also overturned by
the appeals court, and a trial is scheduled for November.

<HEAD>Great Northern Shareholders Give Final OK to Georgia-Pacific
Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. shareholders gave
formal approval Friday to a $5 billion takeover by Georgia-Pacific
Corp., creating the nation's largest paper and forest products
company.
   Shareholders of Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern cast the
votes at a special meeting in Georgia-Pacific's hometown of
Atlanta. Vote totals were not immediately released, although
Georgia-Pacific said previously it controlled enough shares to
ensure easy approval of the merger.
   The $65.75-a-share cash tender for the Great Northern shares was
completed in March, giving Georgia-Pacific ownership of 96 percent
of the company.
   A Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman said the merger, under which Great
Northern will become a wholly owned subsidiary of G-P, is expected
to take effect when merger documents are filed next week in Maine
and Delaware. Great Northern is incorporated in Maine, and NM
Acquisition Corp., the Georgia-Pacific subsidiary formed to handle
the takeover, is incorporated in Delaware.
   Also expected to be completed next week is a commitment for a $4
billion revolving credit and term loan from a syndicate of 25
banks, part of a plan to pay for the debt associated with the
takeover and provide working capital, said Georgia-Pacific
spokeswoman Sheila Weidman.
   Friday's vote put a quiet stamp of approval on a merger that for
nearly four months, beginning last Halloween, generated acrimony
and lawsuits between the companies, state officials and
conservationists.
   Great Northern officials accused Georgia-Pacific of lying about
its intentions and said the Atlanta company would quickly sell off
its woodlands and mills. Great Northern also charged the merger
would violate federal antitrust laws.
   Georgia-Pacific ran full-page advertisements in newspapers
accusing Great Northern's board of directors of selfishness for
refusing to negotiate a deal.
   The angry rhetoric subsided Feb. 20, when the two companies
jointly announced plans for the merger. William R. Laidig, who as
chairman of Great Northern led the fight against the takeover,
later stepped down.
   The new company has operations in every state except Alaska.

<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners, one of the most prominent
takeover strategists of the 1980s, said Friday it is closing up
shop in response to the shrinking market for mergers and
acquisitions.
   But the three men who led the investor group aren't going out of
business. They're restructuring their operation to reflect the
changing times.
   ``We're realistic,'' said Paul E. Tierney Jr., one of the three
founding partners of Coniston. ``We're trying to adapt our
investment policy to what we believe to be the current market
environment and we think it's changed a lot.''
   In its heyday, Coniston's biggest targets included Gillette Co.,
Allegis Corp. and TW Services Inc.
   Coniston said it was disbanding the $700 million investment pool
it used to fund its takeover bids and proxy fights because of the
scarcity of financing and suitable target companies. Most of the
money will be returned to Coniston's investors.
   The trio will continue its investment in UAL Corp., the
successor to Allegis, and its ownership of TW Services, the food
service company whose operations include the Denny's restaurant
chain.
   Tierney and his partners, Augustus K. Oliver and Keith R.
Gollust, said they would secure financing for future deals on a
case-by-case basis.
   Disbanding Coniston relieves the partners of their
responsibilities to investors, which have become more difficult to
fulfill with the changes in the takeover market, Tierney said.
   He noted Coniston had a 40 percent rate of return before the
general partners' interests were subtracted _ ``a very difficult
rate of return to achieve and sustain with the way the market is
going.''
   The trio plans to continue looking for acquisitions, but may
move into areas such as real estate and foreign companies, where
they have not been heavily invested, Tierney said in an interview.
   They will also look for companies in bankruptcy or financial
distress that need investors, and will be involved in arbitrage,
the practice of selling a security in one market and buying it for
less in another market to profit from the price difference.
   The demise of Coniston marks the latest retreat of the 1980s
corporate raiders following the collapse of the junk bond market
last fall. The failure of the $6.7 billion buyout of Federated
Department Stores Inc. by Campeau Corp. last September slowed
takeover financing to a crawl and brought the merger boom to an end.
   Coincidentally, another big investor group, Shamrock Holdings
Inc., also is shifting away from takeovers toward a different kind
of venture. Shamrock, which failed in a 1988 hostile bid for
Polaroid Corp., said it is forming a fund to help bail out
companies that are faltering under heavy debt loads.
   News that Coniston was closing came on the same day that Philip
Morris Cos. announced it would acquire the Swiss coffee and
chocolate company Jacobs Suchard AG in a $3.8 billion deal. But
there's no irony in that.
   The deals being done these days, including the Suchard
acquisition, tend to be strategic moves by companies looking for
expansion in a related industry. That was not the case with
takeover strategists or corporate raiders like Coniston, who
generally were investors seeking profits on their stock holdings.
   Tierney, Oliver and Gollust _ all Ivy League graduates _ formed
Coniston in 1982 as the takeover boom was awakening. The
partnership typically took a large stake in a target firm and
pressured management to take actions to increase the price of the
company's stock.
   One of its biggest successes came in 1987 at Allegis, the parent
of United Airlines, the Hertz car rental company and two hotel
chains.
   Armed with a 13 percent stake in the company, Coniston
threatened a proxy fight and forced the Allegis board to fire
Chairman Richard J. Ferris and shed all its assets except for
United Airlines. Coniston came away with a $175 million profit.
   Allegis changed its name to UAL Corp. _ and the company's
management eventually found itself again tussling with Coniston.
The partnership is currently participating in a $4.38 billion plan
by United Airlines employees to take UAL private.
   In 1988, Coniston lost a proxy fight for four seats on
Gillette's board. The partnership and the company later reached an
agreement under which Gillette bought back 16 million of its
shares, giving Coniston a profit at least on paper.
   Last year, after a protracted fight, Coniston won control of TW
Services.

   Farm real estate values, including land and
buildings, are forecast to rise 3 percent to 4 percent this year,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   That would be near the 4 percent gain of 1989 and the fourth
consecutive annual increase in farmland prices.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service said
the 1990 forecast reflects expectations of possible record net farm
income, slightly lower inflation and recent changes in farmland
values.
   Farm real estate prices averaged $693 per acre Jan. 1, up from
$667 on Jan. 1, 1989. That was still far below the record of $823
per acre nationally in 1982, before land values tumbled.

   The deal could also produce an insider trading investigation,
Swiss officials said.
   The combined company, linking Suchard with Philip Morris's Kraft

while Philip Morris sold more than $5 billion of its tobacco

   Computer-program selling overpowered a modest
attempt to rally in the stock market Friday, driving prices sharply
lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in the early going, was off 44.55 at 2,857.18 by the close.
   That stretched its loss for the week to 78.71 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
607 up, 893 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 172.57 million
shares, up from 138.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 207.70 million shares.
   The drop was concentrated in blue chips, which yielded to sell
orders from professionals engaged in computer program strategies
involving stock index options and futures.
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was unsettled by concern
over a slowdown in consumer spending since early this year.
   Three straight monthly declines in retail sales have stirred new
talk of a possible business slump and dampened some recent
enthusiasm over falling interest rates.
   Investors appeared to take in stride a Commerce Department
report that new factory orders for durable goods rose 3.9 percent
in May after falling 4.2 percent the month before.
   The gain in the latest month was attributed largely to orders
for transportation equipment, specifically cars and aircraft.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 2~ at 116\; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1&lsqb;
at 42{; Boeing, down 1| at 57&rsqb;, and Exxon, down } at 47~.
   Philip Morris settled for a &rsqb; gain at 44} after trading as high
as 46&rsqb; on heavy volume. The company announced plans to expand its
already vast consumer products empire by acquiring the Swiss coffee
and candy conglomerate Jacobs Suchard for about $3.8 billion.
   In a weak regional telephone group, Bell South fell 1| to 52~;
Nynex 1&rsqb; to 83\; Pacific Telesis 1&lsqb; to 42}, and Southwestern Bell 1
to 53}. The Federal Communications Commission has ordered a $1.1
billion cut in access rates local telephone companies charge
long-distance companies.
   Intermec tumbled 3&lsqb; to 13&lsqb; in the over-the-counter market. The
company said its earnings for the fiscal quarter ending June 30
would be significantly depressed by moving costs and weakness in
sales to the Defense Department.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $36.79 billion, or 1.07
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.25 to 194.24.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 5.87 to 417.10, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 5.04 at 355.43.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.94 to 459.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 359.29, down .93.

<TEXT>
   Minneapolis-based First Bank Systems
Inc. on Thursday terminated its planned acquisition of Banks of
Iowa Inc., Iowa's biggest bank holding company, breaking off an
8{-year engagement.
   The courtship of Des Moines-based Banks of Iowa by First Bank
had been at the center of an acrimonious debate over legalizing
interstate banking in Iowa. Iowa's interstate banking law becomes
effective in 1991.
   But Holmes Foster, chairman of Banks of Iowa, told shareholders
at the company's annual meeting that the deal fell through because
a weakened financial condition left First Bank System unable to
obtain the necessary regulatory approval for the takeover.
   Foster said Banks of Iowa would begin discussions with other
potential buyers, disclosing the institution already has been
approached by three serious suitors. He did not identify the
prospective purchasers and said there is no assurance any deal
would be struck.
   Banks of Iowa stock fell 50 cents to $69.50 a share in national
over-the-counter trading. First Bank System fell 25 cents to $14.50
a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   First Bank System has assets of $20.2 billion and has 32 banks
and trust companies with more than 140 offices in Minnesota,
Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington and
Wisconsin.
   Banks of Iowa has assets of $2.59 billion with 12 affiliate
banks and a data processing company in Iowa.
   Under their December 1981 deal, First Bank agreed to pay 1.5
times Banks of Iowa's book value at the time the interstate banking
law passed.
   At the time, First Bank also bought 550,000 shares of Banks of
Iowa stock from a minority shareholder.
   Under the breakup agreement, Banks of Iowa will buy back the
550,000 shares for nearly $38 million, or $69 a share, pending
regulatory approval.
   First Bank System said it expected a net gain of about $9.5
million on the sale of its stock and said the proceeds would be
credited to a previously established reserve for its financial
restructuring.
   The takeover agreement had been contingent on the approval of a
law to allow interstate ownership and operation of banks.
   Minnesota authorized such deals in 1986. This year, after years
of bitter legislative battles, Iowa passed an interstate banking
law that will take effect at the beginning of 1991. The Iowa law
allows interstate banking with institutions in adjoining states.
   But before the deal became legal, First Bank System ran into
financial difficulties.
   Two years ago, First Bank System reported a $317 million loss as
a result of a $497 million pre-tax loss on the sale of securities.
In 1989, the company encountered loan problems.
   Foster told the shareholders meeting in Des Moines that even
though First Bank System recently raised $175 million of new
equity, neither company believed the Federal Reserve would allow
completion of the deal or any other such transaction between the
two ``either now or in the foreseeable future.''
   Foster said the termination of the agreement will permit Banks
of Iowa to pursue other deals with the help of The Chicago Corp.,
an investment banking firm.

<HEAD>Securities Industry Optimistic About Stock Index Futures Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A securities industry group on Thursday
stepped up its lobbying for passage of a Bush administration
proposal to transfer regulatory authority for stock-index futures.
   Last month the Treasury Department unveiled legislation that
would strip the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of its
authority over stock index futures and give it to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   ``I think right now it's a toss-up. A week ago I'd say we were a
decided underdog,'' said Joseph R. Hardiman, president and chief
executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers. ``Give
us more time and I think we'll prevail.''
   The NASD is part of an ad hoc Coalition for Intermarket
Coordination that has been meeting with senators to push for
passage of the amendement.
   Other members include: the American Stock Exchange, the Boston
Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Pacific
Stock Exchange and the National Securities Clearing Corp.
   ``Our position is getting stronger with every day,'' Hardiman
said. ``If you'd asked us a week ago we would have said `Heavens
don't let them take a vote now!' Today we're saying things are
looking a lot better because we've had an opportunity to tell our
story and the more people we tell it to the more ears we get that
are willing to listen.''
   In a joint interview with Nicholas A. Giordano, president of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman of
Options Clearing Corp., Hardiman said members of the group had
spoken with 25 to 30 senators.
   ``I think there's a lot of undecided votes,'' said
Luthringshausen, the coalition's chairman.

   The administration and the SEC said the index futures measure is
necessary to best regulate the securities, which some critics hold
responsible for sharp rises and drops in market prices.
   The proposal also would give the SEC authority to oversee stock
index futures margins, the down payment required of investors who
buy the securities on credit.
   The commodity futures exchanges currently set those margins,
which are generally much lower than those for securities. The SEC
and Treasury have said low stock index futures margins partly were
to blame for the 1987 stock market crash and the 190-point market
drop last October.
   Stock index futures allow investors to speculate on movements in
the stock market without buying the underlying stock.
   The administration proposal, strongly opposed by the futures
industry and the CFTC, was introduced as a separate bill in the
House but will be included in CFTC market reform legislation which
has been pending since last fall.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Down</HEAD>

   The dollar was mixed against most major
currencies Friday, with most activity centered on the sale of
Canadian dollars as the deadline approached for Canada to approve
controversial constitutional accord.
   Gold declined domestically and overseas.
   The U.S. dollar gained against the Canadian dollar in New York
trading as the midnight Saturday deadline approached for approval
of the Meech Lake accord. The agreement, which would recognize
French-speaking Quebec as a ``distinct society,'' will expire if
not approved by all 10 provinces by the deadline.
   There has been speculation that Quebec will try to separate from
Canada if the accord is not approved.
   The approaching deadline has caused money to leave Canada,
pushing the currency down against the dollar, said Robert Hatcher,
a corporate dealer in Barclays Bank PLC's foreign exchange
department in New York.
   Canada's central bank intervened in the market in an attempt to
bolster the currency.
   The U.S. dollar late Friday rose to 1.1785 against the Canadian
dollar compared with 1.1758 late Thursday in New York.
   Overall, however, currency trading was slow Friday.
   ``This market is still rather confused and without conviction,''
Hatcher said.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.4110 Swiss francs, down from 1.4135;
5.6215 French francs, down from 5.6265; 1,226.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,228.25; and 1.6740 German marks, down from 1.6795.
   In London, the British pound jumped to $1.7330 from $1.7255 late
Thursday. The pound was up at $1.7330 late in New York, compared
with $1.7200 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates were: 1.6737 West German marks, down from 1.6795; 1.4085
Swiss francs, down from 1.4150; 5.6220 French francs, down from
5.6385; 1.8835 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8885; 1,227.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,231.00; and 1.1816 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1748.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.15 yen to a closing 154.75
yen. Later, in London, it also was quoted at 154.75 yen and in New
York it closed at 154.90 yen, up from 154.75 yen late Thursday.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery was off 30 cents a troy ounce to $350.40. Later, Republic
National Bank in New York reported a late bid of $349.50 an ounce,
40 cents lower from Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $348.75 a troy ounce
from $350.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid
of $349.40 from $350.50 late Thursday. Gold in Hong Kong dropped 82
cents close at $350.83.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.83 a
troy ounce from $4.84 bid late Thursday. In New York, silver for
current delivery closed at $4.81 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange, down from $4.82 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Up Slightly Due To Boost From Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices rose marginally Friday in
sluggish trading due to a last-minute drop in the stock markets.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose &lsqb; point, or $1.25 per
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, fell to 8.47 percent from 8.49 percent late Thursday.
   The bond market had little reaction to a series of government
economic reports, traders said.
   The Commerce Department reported that personal income edged up
0.3 percent in May and personal spending was unchanged from April.
The department later reported a 3.9 percent increase in durable
goods orders to U.S. factories in May.
   The two reports seemed to cancel each other out, said Elizabeth
Reiners, a bond market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The
durable goods report showed a strong industrial sector, but that
was offset by weaker-than-expected personal consumption data, she
said.
   Bond prices moved in a tight range Friday until late afternoon,
when stock prices on Wall Street plummeted in the last half-hour of
trading on those markets, said James Marshall, a government
securities trader at Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   ``That caused the short end especially _ but the whole Treasury
(security) market _ to end up on the plus side,'' he said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up more than 10
points earlier in the day, dropped by 44.55 at 2,857.18 by the
close. Computer-driven program selling was blamed for the drop.
   Marshall said investors typically flock to short-term Treasury
securities, such as two- and three-year notes, when stock prices
plummet. Treasury securities are regarded as a liquid, safe
investment.
   Prices of the short-term governments were up from 1-32 point to
3-32 point, intermediate maturities rose from 1-16 point to 3-32
point, and long-term issues were up &lsqb; point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.70 to 1,157.68.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.00 percent as the
discount lost 1 basis point to move to 7.75 percent. Yields on
six-month bills dropped to 8.02 percent as the discount fell 2
basis points to 7.62 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.08
percent as the discount dropped 2 basis points to 7.54 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, unchanged
from late Wednesday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds remained at 91 5-16 point. The average yield
to maturity also was unchanged, at 7.54 percent.

<HEAD>Memo Downplays Significance of Talks With Other Carriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines officials plan to meet
representatives of at least two other carriers that have expressed
interest in the troubled company, but Eastern played down the
possibility of a merger or buyout.
   In a memorandum distributed to its employees Wednesday, Eastern
said Pan American World Airways and Northwest Airlines have
requested discussions and certain information about Eastern
``concerning the possibility of future business relationships.''
   ``Sharing the appropriate information or meeting to find out
what someone has in mind does not mean a merger or takeover, or
that one is planned or imminent,'' the memo stated. ``It does not
mean that Eastern is charting a course to relinquish our
independence.''
   The memo noted that Martin Shugrue, the airline's
court-appointed trustee, ``must continue to evaluate all options
while seeking to act in the best interests of Eastern, our
employees, creditors and the traveling public.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined to elaborate on the
planned talks or what information the carriers requested.
   Both Pan Am and Northwest have acknowledged publicly they are
looking for possible mergers or acquisitions.
   Eastern is attempting to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
court protection. It filed for protection on March 9, 1989, five
days after a crippling strike by Machinists, flight attendants and
pilots.
   Eastern recently sold its Latin American routes to American
Airlines for $310 million but still is negotiating final points of
the deal.
   American contends an Eastern hangar at New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport is in worse condition that Eastern
claimed. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland has given the two
carriers until Aug. 15 to reach an agreement.
   Eastern had agreed to place $7.2 million in an escrow fund to
pay for cleaning up the terminal, but the two carriers now disagree
about whether the amount should be a cap for the repairs.

<HEAD>Report: UAL Unions Wooing Boeing, GE</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unions seeking to buy out the parent of
United Airlines reportedly are trying to persuade Boeing Co. and
General Electric Co. _ two of United's chief equipment suppliers _
to invest in the takeover.
   United Employees Acquisition Corp., the entity formed by the
unions to handle the acquisition, is seeking either a cash or debt
investment from Boeing and GE, the Wall Street Journal reported
Thursday.
   In return, the companies would receive either preferred stock or
a note in UAL Corp., the Chicago-based parent of United, but no
common stock.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified union officials, said the
labor group also discussed giving Boeing and GE preferred-supplier
status if they join in the $4.58 billion buyout.
   UAL stock settled up 50 cents Thursday at $156.50, well below
the $200-a-share offer by the employee group.
   Steven Mathews, a spokesman for the unions, refused to comment
Thursday on the report. Bruce Bunch, a spokesman for General
Electric, also refused to comment. Telephone calls to Seattle-based
Boeing were not returned.
   Both Boeing, the world's biggest maker of commercial aircraft,
and GE, a maker of jet engines and electronic equipment used in
airliners, have a long-term relationship with United.
   United has announced intentions to order about $15 billion in
new aircraft, a contract Boeing is seeking. General Electric is
competing with other engine manufacturers to provide engines for
some of the aircraft being considered.
   An investment by either company could reduce the buyout group's
dependency on bank financing.
   The labor group has until Aug. 9 to secure financing for a
takeover. The group recently hired former Chrysler Corp. vice
chairman Gerald Greenwald to direct the search for financing.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Seen Heading Lower After Supply Report</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 17th graf, `West Texas ...,' to CORRECT changes in West
Texas Intermediate oil to cents sted fractions of a cent.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Pork belly futures, which have taken a severe beating in the
past two weeks, are expected to fall even further after a
government report Friday showed a greater supply than the market
had expected.
   But analysts said the report would quickly be overshadowed by
the Agriculture Department's quarterly hogs and pigs tally, which
is due out next Friday.
   In trading Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, frozen
pork belly futures fell the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound for the fifth time in the last seven trading sessions.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures rose; grains and
soybeans were lower; orange juice advanced; and precious metals
retreated.
   Frozen pork bellies settled .95 cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at 59.40 cents a pound, the first
close below 60 cents since April 18.
   In livestock trading, hog futures ended .15 cent lower to .78
cent higher with August at 57.95 cents a pound; live cattle were
.30 cent to .78 cent lower with August at 73.27 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .20 cent to .67 cent lower with August at 84.75
cents a pound.
   A pork belly is the part of a hog from which bacon is made.
   Slack demand for pork has weighed heavily on hog and belly
futures for the last two weeks, and the USDA's monthly cold-storage
report Friday offered no support.
   The report, which was released after the close, showed 105.5
million pounds of bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as of
May 31, nearly 3 million pounds above market expectations.
   The number was 26 percent below the year-ago level and about 7
percent higher than the 10-year average, said Charles Levitt,
senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago.
   Analysts predicted another limit drop in belly futures Monday
but said traders are likely to then turn their attention to the
upcoming hogs-and-pigs report.
   ``The big thing's coming down the pike a week from today,'' said
analyst Dale Durchholz of AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington,
Ill.
   Levitt estimated the report will show a 1 percent decline in the
U.S. hog herd since last year. But he said it also likely will show
an increase in farrowing intentions, meaning that beginning this
summer the number of hogs being born will be larger than a year ago.
   ``That is more negative to the longer term situation in the
market than anything a monthly cold-storage report could show,''
Levitt said.
   Crude oil futures made their strongest advance since June 12 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, boosted by technical factors.
   Once the August crude contract pushed above the $17.30-a-barrel
barrier, the market ``just jerked'' higher, said analyst James
Steel at Refco Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 52 cents
higher with August at $17.46 a barrel; heating oil was .75 cent to
.99 cent higher with July at 48.66 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .40 cent to 1.35 cents higher with July at 61.37 cents
a gallon.
   Crop futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade as
forecasts for beneficial dry weather in the Midwest prompted
profit-taking after strong gains during the week.
   Wheat futures settled 4\ cents lower to } cent higher with July
at $3.33} a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4{ cents lower with July
at $2.82 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6\ cents lower with July at
$1.34{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents lower with July
at $5.99{ a bushel.
   Orange juice futures continued to rebound from a recent sharp
decline on the New York Cotton Exchange.
   Future deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice settled
.45 cent to 4.75 cents higher with July at $1.839 a pound.
   Precious metals were little changed on New York's Commodity
Exchange, where gold settled 30 cent to 50 cents lower with June at
$350.40 a troy ounce; and silver was 1.1 cents to 1.3 cents lower
with June at $4.813 a troy ounce.

   Quaker Oats Co., anticipating poor sales and
earnings in its current fiscal year, said Friday it will lay off
hundreds of workers and reorganize the management of its largest
division, U.S. grocery products.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William D. Smithburg said
in a statement that the Chicago-based company expected flat or
slightly lower sales and earnings for the year ending June 30.
   Smithburg said several hundred positions will be eliminated
during the next fiscal year. He did not say exactly how many or

   The reorganization of the grocery products division involves a
number of management changes.
   Smithburg also said he will become president and chief operating
officer of Quaker in September, following the retirement of Frank

   Leo R. Breitman has been promoted to vice chairman
and senior credit policy officer of the financially troubled Bank
of New England Corp., the bank said Friday.
   Breitman's former position as president of Bank of New England
will be filled by D. Bruce Wheeler, executive vice president of
First Nationwide Bank in California and a former Bank of Boston
executive, according to a statement by the bank.
   As senior credit policy officer, Breitman will set credit policy
for the corporation and its subsidiary banks. As president and
chief operating officer of the bank unit, Wheeler will oversee
corporate, commercial and retail banking and commercial real estate.
   Breitman, 49, has been president of the Connecticut Bank and
Trust and was president and chief operating officer of Patriot Bank
from 1985 to 1987.
   Wheeler, 43, was with Bank of Boston from 1982 to 1989. Prior to
joining Bank of Boston, he was a general manager of Crocker
National Bank's international banking subsidiary in New York City.
   Bank of New England Corp. is a Boston-based interstate bank
holding company with assets of $25 billion and banking offices in
four New England states.
   The bank, which lost more than $1 billion last year, has
announced plans to streamline its operations through a combination
of layoffs, attrition and sales of assets. Much of the bank's
trouble has been blamed on shaky construction loans that were
exposed with the recent downturn in the Northeast real estate
market.

   A buyer was found Friday for Kittinger Co.,
less than a month before the famous furniture maker was to have
auctioned off its equipment and closed.
   Kittinger, which once made furniture for the White House and
Colonial Williamsburg, was sold to Pittsburgh businessman Michael
Carlow, its parent firm, Ladd Furniture Inc. of High Point, N.C.,
said in a news release.
   Ladd, which has owned Kittinger since July 1989, had said in
February it planned to close Kittinger because it had been unable
to find a buyer.
   David Ogren, Kittinger's president, could not be reached for
comment. There was no answer at his office telephone. Carlow has an
unlisted telephone number in Pittsburgh.
   John Ong, a Ladd spokesman, said he could not elaborate on the
news release, which described Carlow only as ``a prominent
Pittsburgh businessman.'' He said the company would hold a news
conference Monday in Buffalo.
   A day earlier, Kittinger announced it lost its 54-year-old
contract with Colonial Williamsburg to make its licensed
18th-century furniture reproductions. Ogren said then that the
contract accounted for $3 million of the company's $16 million in
sales in 1989.
   ``We held on and we held on,'' said Richard Schreiber, the
Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's vice president. ``Finally, it
just comes to the point where it becomes quite apparent that the
company is going to be shut down.''
   Ong said he did not know whether the sale of Kittinger was
closed before or after the cancellation of the Colonial
Williamsburg contract. He said the loss of that contract would not
affect the sale, but refused to comment on what effect it would
have on the company's continued viability.

   An arrogant, young commodities broker devised
``the perfect scam'' to skim customer profits, a prosecutor said
Friday as the first case in a sweeping probe of the world's largest
commodities exchanges went to the jury.
   Robert Mosky, 34, facing fraud and racketeering charges,
regularly and illegally circumvented the rules of trade at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Swiss franc futures pit, Assistant
U.S. Attorney James P. Fleissner said during closing arguments.
   Jurors were unable to reach a verdict after deliberating two
hours Friday afternoon. They will resume at 10:30 a.m. EDT Monday.
   Mosky and two other traders in the Swiss franc pit, Danny Scheck
and David Zatz, were the first to stand trial in a lengthy FBI
investigation of corruption at the Mercantile Exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   In all, 48 people have been indicted and 16 already have pleaded
guilty.
   Mosky was alleged by prosecutors to be the ringleader of a group
of traders who routinely stole money from customers by trading
schemes that prevented customer orders from being executed in the
open market.
   ``It's the perfect scam,'' Fleissner told jurors who heard
testimony in U.S. District Judge Ann C. William's courtroom for
more than six weeks. ``You can do it _ and you can't get caught.''
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz were charged last August with more than a
dozen counts each of mail or wire fraud, and violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act. Each count carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $150,000 fine.
   Mosky also was charged with racketeering conspiracy, which
carries a maximum prison term of 20 years. He also could be forced
to forfeit personal assets.
   The government alleged that the three men executed customer
orders through pre-arranged or off-market trades instead of through
open outcry.
   By doing so, prosecutors said, customers were denied the
superior prices that would result from open competitive trading.
   The defendants were accused of shifting their personal losses
from trading errors into their customers' accounts, then hiding
their practices by changing or destroying trading records.
   During closing arguments, Fleissner argued Mosky was arrogant
and greedy.
   Once the undercover probe of the exchanges was revealed in
January 1989, Fleissner said, Mosky told a colleague prosecution
tape recordings were probably worthless and bragged, ``If no one
talks, they've got no tapes.''
   But in closing arguments Thursday, Mosky's attorney, Elliot
Samuels, said his client had been scape-goated by over-eager
prosecutors trying to enforce ambiguous commodities trading rules.
   ``If they're not happy with the damn rules, let them go to
Washington and get Congress to change it _ but don't put Bob Mosky
in jail because of it,'' Samuels said.
   His concluding remarks differed considerably from those made by
the attorneys of Scheck and Zatz, who instead attacked the
credibility of government witnesses, including that of FBI agent
Randall Jannett, who posed undercover as a corrupt trader.
   But Fleissner said Jannett was ``no bumpkin.''
   ``Did Agent Jannett make mistakes?'' Fleissner asked
rhetorically. ``There were mistakes.
   ``But you go back and count those mistakes up _ see how far you
get on your second hand,'' he instructed the jury.

   A syndicate of banks Friday began to soften its
opposition to a $65 million loan and restructuring plan that would
help Donald Trump avert default on a casino bond issue.
   However, a final agreement on the plan, which would suspend some
payments on bank loans in return for equity in some of Trump's
properties, still had not been reached.
   A group of four banks _ three Japanese and one German
institution with a combined $75 million loan to Trump secured by
Trump Tower _ had opposed the restructuring because it would put a
new lien on the Fifth Avenue skyscraper.
   The four banks are Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank of Japan and the Dresdner Bank of Germany. They
reportedly don't like the idea of someone else having a claim to
property that secures their loans.
   On Friday, some of the Japanese banks began to acquiesce, said a
banking source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The foreign banks are tied into a large network of lenders to
Trump, led by Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust and
Manufacturers Hanover, that pressed Trump to restructure his
finances after he asked for a fresh loan to cover the bond payment.
   The payment was due last week on bonds issued to finance the
Trump Castle hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Under a grace
period, he has until midnight Tuesday to make the $43 million
payment.
   Trump issued a statement Friday afternoon confirming there had
been progress.
   ``An overwhelming number of participating lenders, representing
both national and international financial institutions, have now
joined the major banks in supporting our plan,'' Trump said in a
prepared statement.
   ``I am confident that the handful of remaining banks will choose
to join us to get this restructuring deal put together,'' he said.
   Trump has until midnight Tuesday to finalize the plan or the
banks could move to seize his assets. A 10-day grace period started
after he failed to make the initial June 15 midnight due date.
   If he defaults, bankruptcy court could become the most
attractive building in Manhattan to the struggling
developer.Failing to make the payment on the Trump Castle bonds
could trigger defaults on bank loans secured by other properties
that could be seized, said analysts.
   If faced with seizure by his bank lenders, whom he owes about $2
billion, bankruptcy court could provide Trump with time to avoid a
foreclosure and get a better price by selling assets in an orderly
fashion.
   ``He could risk losing everything now, or retain things to
sell'' under bankruptcy, one analyst said.
   If the banks took a property, they could get a bargain if the
market value of the property exceeds the balance of outstanding
loans against it, analysts said.
   There is some risk for the banks, who may not want to take on
real estate in the slumping New York market. They may fare better
by loaning Trump enough money to get him through his cash crisis
and look at selling properties when Manhattan real estate prices
recover.
   While it is possible Trump would take all his properties into
bankruptcy court, it is more likely that he would only need to
protect those to which the banks could lay claim.
   The bond obligations on Trump's two other Atlantic City
hotel-casinos, the Trump Plaza and the Taj Mahal, protect them from
defaulting domino-style after a Trump Castle default.
   However, the terms of the bank loans are not public like bond
agreements, so there is no way of knowing for certain which have
the commonly-used cross-default clauses.
   Even if the foreign bank problem is solved, paperwork on the
compex deal probably couldn't be completed before the deadline, one
individual involved in the talks said. If all sides agree to the
restructuring and loan, it is likely a short-term loan could be
arranged to help him make his payment, the individual said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Trump cannot negotiate an extension of the bond payment
deadline, said Paul Levine, spokesman for First Fidelity Bank in
Newark, N.J., trustee for the bonds. The language in the bond
agreements allows for no extension after the 10-day grace period,
he said.
   Trump has raised some cash through asset sales recently. On
Thursday he announced he sold a shipyard near Amsterdam in the
Netherlands. New York Newsday reported last month that he paid $5
million for the shipyard to make sure work was completed on a
420-foot yacht being built for him.
   Through a spokesman, Trump said he made a substantial profit on
the sale, but would not disclose the price.

   President Bush said he wants to double
spending to pursue savings and loan fraud, but Democrats said the
proposal was too little too late.
   Bush's proposal Friday also would establish ``rapid response
teams'' and name a Justice Department official to direct the
effort. Democrats said they found little new in the plan and called
it an admission that past anti-fraud efforts had failed.
   The program would double spending for Justice Department and
Internal Revenue Service investigators and prosecutors to $100
million in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.

   The export drop reflected a decline in oil production caused by

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Friday it will drop its
week-old campaign to halt imports of autofocus cameras made by
Minolta Camera Co.
   Honeywell said it was withdrawing its complaint before the
International Trade Commission because an expedited trial date of
Sept. 3, 1991, was set in a corresponding civil suit.
   But Minolta, the Japanese camera-maker, said Honeywell withdrew
its ITC action because it is bound under contract to settle the
dispute in court.
   Honeywell's autofocus patent infringement lawsuit has been
pending for more than three years. When Honeywell announced June 14
it was asking the ITC to ban imports on Minolta Maxxum cameras and
other models, the company said a trial was two years away.
   Honeywell said it was calling for the import ban in hopes of
getting quicker relief. The Minneapolis-based company said it is
unjustly losing millions of dollars in royalties while the case is
being litigated.
   The lawsuit accuses Minolta of infringing on four Honeywell
patents. The ITC action sought to ban imports of Maxxum cameras and
others, including AF-Tele and Freedom Dual models.
   Honeywell contends that Minolta breached a 1979 contract calling
for Honeywell to share patented technology and trade secrets.
Minolta was restricted to using only Honeywell-made autofocus
modules under the contract, Honeywell said.
   Instead, Honeywell alleges, Minolta used Honeywell autofocus
technology while developing a module of its own.
   Minolta said Honeywell's patent claims are ``invalid and
unenforceable.'' The Japanese company said its own autofocus
innovation dates to the 1960s and is well documented by many U.S.
patents.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages and a sales injunction.
   ``Honeywell's filing (with the ITC) was in clear violation of a
prior court order,'' Minolta spokesman Michael Gross said. ``Their
withdrawal was solely to avoid the consequences of this violation.''
   Gross said a court hearing had been set for Monday in U.S.
District Court in Newark, N.J., to challenge the ITC filing. He
said Honeywell ``ran the risk of being formally ordered by the
court to withdraw.''
   Christopher J. Steffen, Honeywell vice president and chief
financial officer, said the company was dropping its ITC action
because it was ``very pleased that our case has been accelerated by
more than one year.''
   ``The fixed trial date will end Minolta's continued efforts to
delay the court case, and will produce a decision in the same time
frame as the ITC action,'' Steffen said.
   But Gross said it was Honeywell's legal maneuvering that
prompted delays in the case. He said the September trial date came
as no surprise to Minolta.
   ``We're very happy with the trial date,'' Gross said. ``We
welcome Honeywell's decision to drop its ITC complaint and abide by
its 1988 agreement to adjudicate this case in the federal court.''

   Shamrock Holdings, the private investment
company headed by Walt Disney's nephew Roy Disney, has formed a
partnership to bail out companies overburdened by debt, Shamrock's
chief strategist said Friday.
   The $450 million fund raised money primarily from previous
investors in Shamrock, the company that last year failed to acquire
Polaroid Corp. after a long, highly publicized bid.
   Several such funds have emerged recently with the intent of
rescuing companies that overleveraged themselves during the
borrowing frenzy of the 1980s.
   ``It's all you're going to be seeing for the next two years,''
Shamrock's chief executive, Stanley P. Gold, said in a telephone
interview.
   Shamrock's fund, Trefoil Capital Partners, is allowed to attempt
hostile takeovers under the terms of the partnership. However, it
is expected to concentrate on friendly, ``white knight'' deals.
Shamrock takes a 1 percent fee for managing the partnership.
   A white knight is a third party that often acquires a stake in a
company to help a takeover target avoid an unfriendly merger.
   ``We want to do three or four deals,'' Gold said. ``About $150
million to $250 million is the ideal.''
   The partnership already has offered to provide capital for
struggling companies, including Southland Corp. and Ames Department
Stores. Both filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
   Shamrock also was interested in investing in Koor Inc., Israel's
biggest conglomerate, which is struggling to service a $1.2 billion
debt. That offer, basically a restructuring in which creditors
would forgive some Koor debt, is typical of those Trefoil will
make, Gold said.
   Trefoil said it would buy a stake in Koor with $100 million of
new equity if the banks and bondholders would forgive half of their
$1.2 billion in Koor debt. No deal has been worked out yet.
   ``They're trying to restructure their debt,'' Gold said. ``They
may come back to us after they make some progress.''
   At a time when junk bond and bank financing for big investors is
hard to come by, the fund will provide Shamrock with a ready source
of funds so it can move fast if it spots an attractive deal.
   Gold said the partnership expects to complete its first deal by
the end of the year.
   Shamrock owns the Music Plus music and video stores in Southern
California and the Sound Warehouse chain in Texas. It also owns 15
radio and three television stations, 15 percent of oil field
equipment maker Enterra Corp., and has various real estate holdings.
   Trefoil is looking into deals in similar industries, officials
said.
