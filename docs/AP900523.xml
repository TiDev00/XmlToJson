<HEAD>Visiting Moscow Police Officer Helps Fool Drug Suspect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A visiting Moscow police official helped
with a local drug bust by tricking the suspects into opening their
hotel door so officers outside could make the arrest, police said
Wednesday.
   Moscow Police Col. V.T. Bobryashov and his Deland police
interpreter ``posed as Russians attempting to gain access to the
wrong room,'' said DeLand Sgt. Steve Dovi.
   Bobryashov spoke Russian while jiggling the suspects' doorknob
and the DeLand Hilton room occupants called hotel security, who
came up to the room, police said.
   The occupants then opened the door to see what was going on, and
Bobryashov pushed the door open further to allow police officers
in. Officers said they asked the visiting dignitary to help them
bluff their way into the room because that would be safer than
identifying themselves and risking attack.
   Police said they seized crack cocaine and other suspected drugs
during the bust late Monday. They arrested Vikki Hankins Henry, 21,
and a 17-year-old juvenile.
   Bobryashov was the top-ranked of 13 visiting Soviet police
officers.

   ``Twin Peaks,'' the surreal ABC series that
became TV's most talked-about low-rated show, ended its current run
Wednesday without solving Laura Palmer's now-maybe murder and with
its FBI agent shot three times.
   The shooting of FBI agent Dale Cooper in his hotel room _ only
the gunman's gloved hand was seen _ came at the end of the show and
undoubtedly shocked many fans who have followed David Lynch's
quirky series from the beginning.
   It was left uncertain whether Cooper was killed. The surprise
shooting was only one of many closing-episode twists that will have
``Twin Peaks'' fans speculating until fall, when the series picks
up somes unresolved questions in a two-hour premiere. Among the
twists:
   _ Jock, a fat barkeep shot during his arrest as a suspect in
Palmer's death, was smothered to death in his hospital bed by her
increasingly deranged father.
   _ Leo Johnson, a drug-dealing trucker also suspected of killing
Palmer, was shot and possibly killed by another Twin Peaks low-life
while trying to murder Bobby, Palmer's two-timing boyfriend, with
an ax.
   _ A mysterious assailant's beating of the mad psychiatrist Dr.
Jacoby, causing the latter to have a heart attack. Or did the heart
attack hit moments earlier when the doctor, hiding at night near a
gazebo, saw a woman he thought was Laura.
   _ The playing of a tape that Palmer, the town's high school
homecoming queen, supposedly made before her death. In it, she
spoke of a mystery man who she said twice tried to kill her, ``but
boy, I sure got off on it.''
   The every-which-way-but-loose finale left the series as it began
_ shrouded in mystery _ despite earlier statements by ABC that it
would tie up some loose ends.
   Created by Lynch _ whose eccentric films includes ``Dune'' and
``Blue Velvet'' _ and Mark Frost, the series is set in a Pacific
Northwest logging town full of sex, lies, drugs, doughnuts, pie and
strange events.
   The last includes last week's slaying of a mynah bird taken into
police custody after suggestions it saw the murder of Palmer.
   In the show's April 8 premiere, the discovery of Palmer's body,
wrapped in plastic, touched off a crying jag by a deputy sheriff.
That it turned out he always cried at murder scenes proved an early
indication that seemingly normal Twin Peaks was in fact Weird City.
   Subsequent episodes featured FBI agent Cooper's dream of a
midget speaking gibberish; Laura's leather-jacketed, two-timing
boyfriend, Bobby, howling like a wolf, and her mother, who has
psychic visions.
   Other characters: the Log Lady toting a log that imparts clues
about the murder; a shoe salesman who lacks a left arm and carries
a suitcase full of right-foot shoes, and singing and dancing
Icelanders considering a land deal.
   A brooding, beautifully filmed series, it is to some is both a
whodunnit and a Gothic put-on of soap operas, one with so many
Byzantine twists that its ardent fans argue for hours about the
meaning of a plot turn or apparent clue.
   Some viewers complain that if one episode is missed, all is lost.
   The show's premiere, preceded by considerable publicity and word
of mouth, had top ratings of 21.7.
   But its Nielsens started sliding immediately, and last week hit
a low of 10.6. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ABC renewed ``Twin Peaks'' for another season, and will air it
on Saturdays with ``China Beach'' next fall.

<HEAD>The Other `Born on the Fourth of July'

<TEXT>
   After 5{ years of work and 50 hours of footage,
filmmaker Loretta Smith has almost finished the movie she wanted to
_ but now can't _ call ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   That was the film's title for four years, but it had to be
scrapped when Oliver Stone used it for his Academy Award-winning
feature on the life of paraplegic Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' earned Stone an Oscar as best
director, and also won an Oscar for editing. Tom Cruise starred as
Kovic in the Universal Studios production that reportedly cost $15
million.
   ``What do you do when someone steals your title?'' Smith said in
a recent interview. She laughed, however, and acknowledged Stone's
help with her own film.
   The title is actually Kovic's, taken from the lyrics of a George
M. Cohan song. He used the phrase as the title of his 1976
autobiography. But Smith had lived with it as a shooting title for
so long that she almost felt it belonged to her.
   ``I see them as complementing one another,'' said Kovic in a
telephone interview from his home in Redondo Beach, Calif.
``They're two very different films about the same person. I think
both the feature and the documentary are important statements.''
   Kovic, 44, was a much-decorated Marine in his second tour in
Vietnam near the Cua Viet River when a sniper's bullet smashed his
spine in January 1968. His resulting paralysis and his experiences
in Veterans Administration hospitals turned him into an anti-war
activist.
   In Smith's documentary, Kovic appears as himself _ sometimes
naked, with catheters hanging from his body. The movie was filmed
with a staff of about 11 people on a budget of $250,000, raised
from small grants and public donations. ``The biggest individual
donation came from Bruce Springsteen at a fundraiser in Venice,
Calif., in 1987,'' Smith said. ``He gave us $10,000 and the use of
four of his songs for the soundtrack.
   ``As a documentary maker, I don't have a very high profile. It's
almost like being a nonperson.''
   The 42-year-old Smith, who once supported her film work by
driving a taxi, came to filmmaking by a roundabout route. A Chicago
native who grew up in Sterling, Ill. (``Ronald Reagan grew up 10
miles away _ how more all-American can you get?''), she was working
as a textbook editor in 1974 when her then-boyfriend, journalist
Richard Boyle, convinced her to trot the world with him.
   The romance didn't last, but it introduced Smith to Boyle's
friend, Kovic, who was then completing his autobiography.
   It proved to be an eventful friendship. Kovic traveled with
Smith and Boyle to Cambodia in 1975, when that nation was falling
to the Khmer Rouge. When Kovic was arrested at a Chicago
demonstration in 1979, Smith _ by then a film student _ was thrown
in the same paddy wagon.
   When Kovic saw Smith's first documentary, an award-winning
effort titled ``Where Did You Get That Woman?'' in 1983, he began
pressuring her to film his story as a documentary. He had become
embittered with the Hollywood approach after the collapse of a 1978
attempt to film his book on a script by Stone. It would have
starred Al Pacino.
   When she began filming Kovic in 1985, Smith thought it would
take her a year to complete. She hadn't counted, though, on the
complexity of her subject, or on America's growing conservatism. As
the film cans piled up, so did the bills.
   ``I was turned down for every grant I applied for,'' she
recalled. ``Government-sponsored agencies simply didn't want to
deal with war and veterans.''
   Smith kept on shooting, though. She gathered harrowing footage
of Kovic's daily routine as a paraplegic, shots of him addressing
veterans' rallies and documentation of a visit to his home town of
Massapequa, N.Y.
   In that sequence, Kovic rolls his wheelchair to a basketball
court where he used to play. He talks to some youths shooting
baskets and finds out that they plan to enlist in the military.
Kovic tells them about his own experiences, but cannot dissuade
them.
   Smith also wove in older material. She obtained home movies from
Kovic's family, showing his Long Island childhood, as well as
combat footage of the war from television archives.
   It grew from a cinematic portrait of a friend into an admitted
obsession.
   ``I really am trying to make a statement,'' she said. ``The
Vietnam war was the central fact for my generation of Americans.
The war touched everyone, whether they went to Vietnam or not, and
it changed us _ we'll never be the same people again.''
   The project often languished, though, for lack of funding. At
times, Smith had to spend more time raising money than working on
the film. Her utility bills went unpaid and her telephone was
frequently disconnected.
   In addition, Kovic's treatment at another VA hospital in 1986
left him depressed and sometimes uncooperative.
   When Stone had a hit with the Oscar-winning ``Platoon,'' and
decided to film Kovic's book himself, Smith became worried. Kovic's
advisory work with Stone often made him unavailable to her, and the
problem of the title had to solved.
   Smith, though, made a deal with Universal whereby the studio got
the title, but she got Universal's aid in the distribution of her
film. Stone, a Vietnam veteran himself, helped raise money.
   ``I'm editing the footage down to feature length right now, and
I want to show it at the New York Film Festival in September, so
I'll have to raise more funding for post-production,'' Smith said.
   ``As for a title, I'm open to suggestions. Maybe I'll just call
it `A Good American.'''

   Palestinian protesters fought police at the door
of the Israeli consulate Tuesday during a demonstration against
Israel's suppression of the Palestinian uprising.
   Nine police officers and eight demonstrators suffered mostly
minor injuries in the emotional melee, according to police and
hospital officials. Nine demonstrators were arrested, said Sgt. Ed
Burns, a police spokesman.
   ``Free Palestine from murder!'' and ``Stop Killing Palestinian
Children!'' yelled some of the demonstrators.
   ``It was like what is happening in the intefadeh, you can't
block the Palestinians with coffee and cake, force has to be
used,'' said Yuval Rotem, a spokesman for the Israeli consulate.
   Intefadeh is an Arabic word to describe the uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Rotem said about a dozen employees were inside the building
during the demonstration, including Consul General Uri Savir.
   He estimated the number of demonstrators at more than 300.
   At least 100 police officers on foot and on horses surrounded
the building, he said. Police refused to say how many officers were
sent.
   Most of the demonstrators stayed within barricades set up by
police, but about 50 charged the door to the building housing the
consulate, according to Said Elatab, a freelance photographer
accompanying the demontrators.
   Seven demonstrators were charged with assault on a police
officer, one with robbery and one with obstruction, Burns said,
refusing to elaborate.

   Taiwanese officials burned more than a
ton of confiscated ivory and 11 lion skins as part of a policy
aimed at protecting wildlife.
   ``The government is determined to implement its policy to
protect wildlife and reverse the nation's unfavorable image,'' Lin
Shiang-nung, vice chairman of the Agriculture Council, said Tuesday.
   He was speaking at a crematory in this northern port city where
officials burned 1,540 pounds of ivory and 11 lion skins worth an
estimated $3.7 million.
   Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, former chairman of the World
Wildlife Foundation, urged other Asian countries to take similar
action.
   In June, Taiwan passed a law imposing a maximum three-year
prison term for the import or sale of ivory and wild animals. The
island has a tradition of importing wildlife for food and ivory for
art and jewelry.

   A year's worth of rain in four months washed out
crops, damaged homes and caused some $300 million in damage in four
states, but experts say dams and levees built since 1950 prevented
a far worse catastrophe.
   Downtown Dallas, for example, probably would have been swamped
by Trinity River had five dams not held back 390 billion gallons of
water _ enough to cover Rhode Island under nearly 2 feet of water.
   ``This would have been the new flood of record,'' said Ron
Ruffennach of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ``Our economists .
.. think $2 billion in damage was prevented in the Dallas area
because of these water projects.''
   Instead, water was held back or channeled away from populated
areas, and flooding in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana was
confined mostly to rural, low-lying flood plains. In those areas,
development is sparse, and agriculture and recreation are the only
industries.
   In all, damage from the water draining south toward the Gulf of
Mexico is estimated at $300 million or more _ most of it related to
agriculture. Exact counts are unavailable because many areas are
still under water, and may remain flooded most of the summer.
   So far, 76 counties in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas have been
declared eligible for federal disaster assistance.
   But as water recedes in most areas, officials say it seems clear
that given the record volume of water, flooding could have been far
worse.
   ``A lot of the area that was flooded was agriculture area and
much less populated than other places. And particularly downstream,
it's safe to say a lot of people received an early warning,'' said
Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for the Texas Office of Emergency
Management.
   ``There's no doubt it could have been a lot worse. The system
worked as it was supposed to,'' added Carol Weathers of the Trinity
River Authority.
   In Louisiana, the Corps of Engineers, which operates
flood-control dams, warned that 700,000 acres of land could be
flooded. With cleanup operations under way, authorities count fewer
than 110,000 flooded acres because levees held.
   About 110 homes sustained damage in five counties, and counts
from six others affected by flooding haven't been made, said Janet
Merritt, chief of disaster services in Louisiana.
   Only two counties in Louisiana apparently will qualify for a
federal disaster declaration, she said. Agricultural losses are
estimated at $7 million.
   Elsewhere:
   _ In Oklahoma, President Bush declared 13 counties eligible for
disaster aid. One child was killed during storms, about 500 homes
were damaged and highways and bridges sustained about $8 million
worth of damage, officials said. No crop or livestock losses were
reported.
   _ In Arkansas, 22 counties have been included in the disaster
declaration, no deaths were reported, about 500 houses were damaged
and agriculture losses were estimated at $4.8 million.
   _ In Kansas City, 208 houses were destroyed, 302 sustained major
damage and 224 minor damage after flooding, which has also covered
800,000 acres of corn. Damage is estimated at least $5 million.
   _ In Mississippi, 345 houses have been damaged by flooding, and
cleanup efforts are well under way.
   _ And in Texas, 12 people died last month because of the floods,
which began April 15. One died last week, authorities said. So far,
41 counties have been made eligible for federal disaster aid, and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has received applications
for aid from 3,473 Texas families.
   Last year, 22 people died in flooding that made 89 Texas
counties eligible for federal disaster assistance. FEMA paid out
$35 million in aid last year.
   ``It's impossible to compare with last year at this time,'' said
FEMA spokesman George Burgess. ``We won't know for some time.''
   What officials do know is that flood control techniques, tested
as never before because of the record volume of water, helped to
lessen the impact of the torrents.
   The flood problem began in January and February when heavy rains
drenched the ground, National Weather Service hydrologist Ernie
Cathey said.
   ``There was no place for the water to go,'' he said.
   Record rains continued through April and into early May. Dallas,
for example, averages 29.46 inches of rain a year. So far this
year, the city has had 29.15 inches.
   The city experienced its worst flooding ever in 1908, when
184,000 cubic feet of water per second raced down the Trinity at
Dallas. The second highest recorded reading was during floods of
1942 _ 110,000 cubic feet per second.
   But this year the peak was 82,000, and hydrologists estimate
that if not for the dams holding back the 390 billion gallons, the
flow rate would have topped 260,000 cubic feet per second.
   Still, the work of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has come
under attack in Arkansas where Gov. Bill Clinton has questioned
decisions to release large amounts of Red River water upstream in
Oklahoma. That water washed out fields in Arkansas and threatened
to crumble a levee at Texarkana.
   The corps is ``taking a second look'' at decisions made in
Oklahoma and Arkansas after Clinton's complaints, Ruffennach said.

   Bart Simpson, the goggle-eyed cartoon kid with a
corrugated hairdo, is catching flak from educators who say his
smart-alecky attitude on ``The Simpsons'' gives children the wrong
message.
   Bart, with his overbite and backtalk (``Don't have a cow,
man!''), is fast becoming an icon of American pop culture, helped
along by a multimillion-dollar merchandising blitz from Fox
Broadcasting Co.
   The scene-stealer on the runaway hit TV show also stars in
Butterfinger candy bar commercials and there are plans for a
starring role in a Nintendo video game. Mattel Inc. promises Bart
dolls and action figures among more than 200 Simpsons products
entering stores.
   This summer, Burger King launches a Simpsons-based ad campaign.
   Bart's influence has reached Stanford University and UCLA, where
he won votes in student elections. He was disqualified in both
races on the technicality that he was not enrolled, prompting
student protests.
   In a telegram from Fox to Stanford students, Bart told voters to
be patient: ``I must tell you I have set my sights on higher goals.
Bart Simpson for U.S. president in '92, man!''
   Bart is fast becoming the fictional youth American children
identify with most. Not bad for a 10-year-old kid with only eight
fingers, eh? But his attitude bothers some critical school
officials.
   Last month, Principal Bill Krumnow of Lutz Elementary School in
Ballville Township, Ohio, banned Bart's ``Underachiever: And Proud
of It, Man,'' T-shirt.
   ``To be proud of being an incompetent is a contradiction of what
we stand for,'' Krumnow said. ``We strive for excellence and to
instill good values in kids.'' The show, he said, ``teaches the
wrong thing to students.''
   The shirt also was banned at Cambridge Elementary School in
Orange, Calif., and last week in Kentucky, Principal Lonnie Watts
of Taylor Mill Elementary School declared the Bart shirt a
dress-code violation.
   ``We feel like the Bart Simpson show does a lot of things that
do not help student self-esteem, such as saying it's OK to be
stupid,'' Watts said.
   ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening and Fox officials prefer to
let Bart defend himself with statements like: ``I have no comment.
My folks taught me to respect elementary school principals, even
the ones who have nothing better to do than tell kids what to
wear.''
   The show's co-executive producer Sam Simon said: ``I don't think
it's the job of elementary school principals to pick the role
models for their kids.''
   The uproar caused J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which created Simpsons
boutiques in its stores, to remove the offending ``underachiever''
shirt and another that reads: ``I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are
you?''
   Even drug czar William J. Bennett took a swipe at Bart. On a May
16 tour of a Pittsburgh drug-treatment center, Bennett saw a poster
of Bart and told recovering addicts they shouldn't follow Bart's
lead as an underachiever.
   ``You guys aren't watching `The Simpsons,' are you? That's not
going to help you any,'' said Bennett, director of the national
drug policy office.
   That wasn't lost on Fox. ``We have great respect for Mr.
Bennett's task and responsibility,'' said Fox spokesman Brad
Turell. ``But I am not aware of any one TV program that will help
teen-agers kick the drug habit.''
   Simon said the heat was the inevitable result of the show's
success.
   ``In a matter of a few months it went from being a cult favorite
to a critical hit to popular acclaim,'' Simon said. ``I knew that
the next step _ because it always is the next step _ is somebody
stepping in and saying it's dangerous.''
   Some authorities disagree with Bart's critics.
   ``I think the Simpson family is one of the few thoughtful
cartoons on commercial broadcasting,'' said Peggy Charren,
president of Action for Children's Television, a lobby and watchdog
group based in Cambridge, Mass.
   ``How can you teach the Constitution if you ban T-shirts?'' she
asked.
   And Fox executives stress they're serious about Bart's image.
   ``We're sensitive to it, but you can't do your show for three
(school) principals,'' said ``Simpsons'' co-producer James L.
Brooks, a creator of ``Taxi,'' ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and
writer-director of ``Terms of Endearment.''
   Brooks said he frequently discusses the show with parents,
educators and child psychologists.
   ``I know from my own childhood that I was messed up most by the
portrayal of perfect families,'' Brooks said. ``When you couldn't
live up to them then you started to think something was wrong with
yours.''

<DATELINE>CUITO CUANAVALE, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At 20, Pvt. Francisco Kisanga is
already a veteran of Angola's civil war, decorated for bravery in
what the government calls its two most decisive victories, at Cuito
Cuanavale and Mavinga.
   Kisanga, a 5-foot-5-inch warrior whose nom-de-guerre is Jiboia _
``Portuguese for a large snake that seizes, bites and kills,'' he
says _ joined the Peoples' Armed Forces for the Liberation of
Angola when he was 15.
   Now, despite renewed peace efforts between the Marxist
government and UNITA rebels, the war for privates like Kasinga
continues as the two ``victories'' are debated.
   He took part in a four-month campaign _ codenamed Operation
Zebra _ that the government said wrestled the town of Mavinga from
rebel hands Feb. 2 before army forces pulled back to their southern
base in Cuito Cuanavale.
   Guiding foreign reporters in an armored car along tracks in the
heavily mined battlefield of Cuito Cuanavale, Kisanga grinned as he
recalled the 1988 battle here and the recent fighting in Mavinga.
   ``Cuito was a real hard battle _ heavy artillery, tanks,
bombs,'' Kisanga said. ``Mavinga was just routine shelling and
mines _ there was no hand-to-hand combat, the kwachas just run
away.''
   ``Kwacha'' _ or ``Wake up!'' in the native Bantu dialect of
Umbundu _ is the battlecry of Jonas Savimbi's UNITA _ National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola. It has fought Angola's
Soviet-backed government first with South African and now with U.S.
aid, since shortly after Angolan independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Kisanga's dismissive summary of the Mavinga battle contrasts
with the heroic picture drawn by Angolan officials and reflects the
controversy surrounding the battles there and at Cuito Cuanavale.
   According to Lt. Col. Francisco Furtado, chief of staff of
Operation Zebra, the attack on Mavinga involved heavy clashes
between 7,500 rebel troops and a similar number of government
soldiers.
   It was launched from Cuito on Dec. 21. On Jan. 29, government
forces finally crossed the river Lomba, 12{ miles north of Mavinga
and the key to strategic control of the area, Furtado said.
   He said 4,748 rebels died, eight were captured and 10
surrendered before government troops withdrew from the town.
   Savimbi, speaking May 15 on the rebels' Voice of the the Black
Cockerel Radio, claimed the rebels routed government troops and
re-occupied Mavinga after heavy fighting.
   Furtado said two tactical groups were still pulling back to
Cuito, where government and Cuban troops halted South Africa's
military push into Angola in March 1988.
   South Africa also claimed victory at Cuito Cuanavale, which
became known as southern Africa's Stalingrad because of heavy
ground and air clashes between South African and Cuban forces.
   Western diplomats in Lisbon said intelligence reports indicated
no major fighting around Mavinga since February.
   Recent rebel actions have been smaller hit-and-run attacks,
bombings and ambushes in Angola's central highlands and northern
provinces bordering Zaire. Zaire serves as a conduit for much of
the $50 million in U.S. aid that UNITA receives yearly.
   ``We have decided to shift units to other parts of the country,
to teach UNITA the lesson they didn't learn at Mavinga,`` Furtado
said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa plans a
summer pilgrimage to the healing springs at Lourdes, a Roman
Catholic official said.
   The visit by Walesa and his wife, Danuta, on Aug. 4-6 will mark
a twin-city agreement between Lourdes and Czestochowa, the site of
Poland's most famous shrine, said Mgr. Stanislaw Jez, head of
Poland's Catholic mission in France.
   According to legend, the ``Black Madonna'' of Czestochowa was
painted by St. Luke on a plank of wood from Christ's table.
   About 4 million people descend on the southern French city of
Lourdes each year to take the reputedly healing waters from its
springs and visit sites where 19th-century teen-ager Bernadette
Soubirous reportedly saw visions of the Virgin Mary.

   A dolphin beached on the banks of the Thames River
in central London was rescued in an elaborate operation involving
the police, the fire service and an animal rights group.
   The dolphin was spotted on the river banks near the Metropolitan
police building Tuesday afternoon, and police and fire service
workers rushed to its rescue.
   A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals said she had no idea where the dolphin came from
or why it was beached. It was believed the dolphin was ill and
could not escape to the open sea when the tide on the Thames went
out.
   The dolphin was placed in a body bag to keep it moist while it
waited for an expert from the London Zoo and an ambulance to arrive.
   It was then driven to an animal hospital and later to a safari
park.

<HEAD>More Country Kids Risk School Failure Than City or Suburban Youth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The countryside offers no escape from the social
and economic pressures that lead kids to do poorly in school, a
study suggests.
   A study that surveyed school officials in 312 rural, urban and
suburban districts last year cast doubt on the popular image of
rural children leading wholesome, trouble-free lives compared with
youngsters in crowded communities.
   The study asked officials to estimate the percentage of their
students who fit into one or more of a dozen risk categories,
including involvement in crime, sexual activity, drug or alcohol
abuse, depression, child abuse, poverty or parents who are
substance abusers.
   Rural children fared worse than non-rural children in 34 out of
39 statistical comparisons, according to the survey by the National
Rural Development Institute based at Western Washington University.
   The report thus suggests that the social and economic strains
facing rural schoolchildren are every bit as bad, and perhaps
worse, as those facing city youngsters.
   Isolation and rural customs are partly to blame, said Doris
Helge, executive director of the institute based at Western
Washington University, in Bellingham, Wash.
   ``A lot of it is attitude,'' Helge said in a telephone
interview. ``Sexual activity and dropping out of school is not that
unusual in rural settings. There's an acceptance of low
self-esteem. A kid has to be really deviant to get any attention.''
   A draft of the study, which also compared the state of students
with mental and physical handicaps to that of non-handicapped
children, was made available to The Associated Press.
   There are brighter spots on the rural landscape, notably in
Minnesota, North Dakota and Iowa, where residents have long put
high value on education and completing school.
   But Helge, an authority on rural education problems, said rural
children with handicaps or psychological problems may fare worse
than others because isolated communities often lack social services
to address their needs.
   Among the survey's findings:
   _17.7 percent of non-handicapped rural high school students were
estimated to be substance abusers, compared with 10.1 percent in
non-rural districts.
   _12.3 percent of non-handicapped rural elementary school
children were found to be suffering depression, compared with 10
percent of urban and 8.5 perecent of suburban youngsters. Among
mildly handicapped youngsters, depression was a problem among an
estimated 16.9 percent of rural grade-schoolers but only 9.5
percent of urban and 12.4 percent of suburban pupils.
   _25.7 percent of non-handicapped rural high school students were
considered sexually active, compared with 22.5 percent of urban and
20.9 percent suburban students. Among mildly handicapped rural high
schoolers, 26.7 percent were sexually active, compared with only
15.3 percent of urban and 18.2 percent of suburban children.
   _6.7 percent of non-handicapped rural middle school youngsters
were said to be involved in crime, compared with an estimated 5.6
percent in urban and suburban schools.
   _12.7 percent of preschool-age rural youngsters without
handicaps were considered victims of child abuse, compared with
11.9 percent in urban and 9.6 percent in suburban districts.
   Social and family strains have worsened in rural communities in
recent years along with downturns in rurally-based industries like
farming, petroleum and timber, experts say.
   ``We shouldn't be surprised that rural children face the same,
if not more difficult circumstances as urban children,'' said
Denise Alston, senior education associate of the Children's Defense
Fund in Washington.
   ``Services from prenatal care to recreation are limited, and
unfortunately, poverty is the common denominator for both groups.''
   Helge said the key to helping troubled rural youngsters lies in
educating parents, teachers and other adults to communicate more
effectively with children and become more attuned to their problems
before they become crises.

<HEAD>Massachusetts House Would Ban Gov't Funding of Offensive Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move that echoes national disputes over
controversial art, the Massachusetts House approved a measure
Tuesday that would prevent state funding of institutions that
display works deemed offensive.
   The measure would bar the Massachusetts Cultural Council from
giving any of its $14 million in grants to any institution
exhibiting art that depicts sexual exploitation of children or
displays religious objects in a disparaging manner.
   The measure, an amendment to the state budget, passed on a voice
vote without debate.
   It is a long way from becoming law. The House version of the
budget must be reconciled with the Senate version, and Gov. Michael
Dukakis, who can veto individual sections of the budget, said he
believed the measure would be unconstitutional.
   Rep. Thomas Finneran, who sponsored the amendment, didn't
specifically define what he meant by offensive, but mentioned
recent disputes over the display of photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.
   ``It would prohibit the granting of financial support for any
individual or group that displays anything that is offensive,''
Finneran said of the measure.
   Federal lawmakers have subjected funding for art to increasing
scrutiny. Last year, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., pressured the
Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C. to cancel a scheduled
exhibition of photographs by Mapplethorpe, whose photos include
homosexual themes and nude children.
   Helms and conservative groups criticized the National Endowment
for the Arts' partial funding of the Mapplethorpe show, as well as
a grant to Serrano, who aroused Helms' ire with his photograph of a
crucifix submerged in urine.
   ``To me in all honesty it's ridiculous to talk about the
expenditure of taxpayer dollars on something that is absolutely
horribly offensive,'' Finneran said.

<HEAD>Residents Worry Indian Lease Will Jeopardize City's Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALAMANCA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly a century in which most
residents paid a few dollars a year, the only U.S. city on land
leased from an Indian reservation has agreed to a fourteenfold
increase in rent to the Seneca Indians.
   The agreement, reached Monday nine months before a 99-year lease
expires, also calls for a $60 million payment from the federal and
state governments to compensate for what both sides said were
unfairly low rents under the old pact.
   But city officials and residents Tuesday worried about how the
community would raise its annual payments to the Indians from
$57,000 to at least $800,000.
   ``If the economy of Salamanca is really impacted by this lease,
it can't survive as a city,'' said Patrick Callaghan, chief city
negotiator. ``The package we worked out is about the best package
we can get from the Senecas. Whether we can get through this, I
don't know.''
   Salamanca was settled in the mid-1840s on land set aside 50
years earlier for an Indian reservation. In 1892, Congress imposed
a lease on the Senecas, over the tribe's objections, that called
for most city residents to pay $5 or less a year. The city as a
whole paid $57,000 last year.
   The lease expires in February, and the uncertainty over what
form the new lease might take had prompted residents to put off
home improvements and businesses to delay expansions. Many banks
refused to make loans on property within the Seneca reservation.
   Some residents appeared stunned and shaken as they left City
Hall after learning the details.
   ``The thing of it is, there are so many people in this town
working for minimum wage,'' said Carl Auge, whose lease fee went
from $10 to $174. ``I don't know how they're going to make it.''
   Frank Dragotta said the $891 a year he will have to pay on his
bicycle store could put it out of business.
   ``I work more or less full time to keep the business afloat.
It's not strong enough to keep going on its own,'' he said. ``I
don't know where I'm going to be.''
   About 90 percent of the property in Salamanca, a city of 6,600,
lies on Seneca land. It is part of the 22,640-acre Allegany
Reservation on the Pennsylvania line.
   Under the new agreement, a residential lease will be assessed at
8 percent of the market value of the land and a non-residential
lease will be 10 percent of the land value. The new lease will run
for 40 years, with an option to renew for another 40 years.
   Residents will pay the Indians a total of $630,000 annually. The
city government will pay the remaining $170,000.
   Several residents said they didn't begrudge paying the tribe
something extra.
   ``Five bucks wasn't enough,'' said Jack Frost, whose rent will
be $161 a year.
   But they said the federal and state governments should help make
the payments. Officials in Washington and New York have said there
is no guarantee that government money will be available even for
the one-time $60 million payment.
   ``They were very instrumental in imposing this on the Indians
and now they're walking away from it,'' said Joe Giblin, whose
payments will rise from $51 to $243.
   In the meantime, Salamanca could wither and die, some residents
said.
   ``The city's not going to grow,'' said Jean Barrett, who will
pay $255 instead of $6. ``How many people build a new house in
Salamanca? How many businesses are in Salamanca? We're just
stifled.''

   A robber cut off a woman's finger to get
her gold wedding band during a break-in at her home, police said.
   A man armed with a gun entered the home of Mary McGowan, 68,
Monday night through a back door that probably was unlocked, said
Police officer J.T. Robinson.
   Mrs. McGowan told police the intruder took several credit cards
and about $5 in cash from her purse, then grabbed her hand and
tried to pull off the gold band.
   When he couldn't get the ring off, he got a knife from the
kitchen, held it to Mrs. McGowan's throat, then used it to cut off
her finger, Robinson said. Officers searched the house and found
the knife used in the assault, but were unable to locate the
severed finger so that doctors might try to reattach it.
   Mrs. McGowan was listed in fair condition Tuesday at Candler
General Hospital. The robber remained at large.

   The only thing undeniable about ``Twin
Peaks'' is that the series opened with homecoming queen Laura
Palmer's body washing ashore, meticulously wrapped in white plastic
tarp.
   OK, maybe even that's not true. Laura's lookalike cousin also
arrived, very much alive, leading at least one TV critic to
theorize that Laura Palmer killed Laura Palmer. Or rather, Laura
Palmer killed her cousin and now is impersonating her.
   It's a whodunit gone amok. In ``Twin Peaks,'' we don't even know
who's been done.
   And if you understand the bizarre, quirky, weird, offbeat
episodic series brought to television by filmdom's offbeat, weird,
quirky and bizarre director David Lynch, please fill the rest of us
in.
   We're hopelessly confused. Tonight's season finale promises to
resolve the Palmer murder in a small Northwest lumber town whose
occupants are alternately obsessed with doughnuts, coffee, pie,
logs, psychic visions, Laura's murder, tape recorders, birds,
wife-beating, cocaine, draperies that glide silently and dancing
dwarfs who talk backwards.
   Newsweek was so confused, it ran a chart titled ``The Story So
Far (As Near As Anyone Can Figure).'' Los Angeles Times television
columnist Howard Rosenberg said he was watching every episode and
``loving it. I think.''
   Here's the basic plot, or a reasonable facsimile:
Seventeen-year-old Laura Palmer turns up dead. Pie-loving FBI agent
Dale Cooper comes to town to help doughnut-loving Sheriff Harry S.
Truman solve the murder. Laura may or may not have been a drug
dealer, but she most definitely was homecoming queen.
   Her mother has psychic visions. There is a woman who carries
around a log. A one-armed man is ominously referred to. Cooper
walks around talking into a tape recorder. Nadine wears an eye
patch, lives for noiseless drapes and is married to ``Big Ed''
Hurley, who runs the town gas station. Josie Packard owns the local
mill and has the hots for Truman.
   Everybody is sleeping with everybody else's husband, wife,
boyfriend, girlfriend ... well, you get the picture.
   If you don't, take heart. ``Twin Peaks'' will be back in the
fall, ABC announced this week. Oh, goody. That gives us all enough
time to get over the motion sickness from trying to figure out this
season.

<HEAD>Fired Editor Sues Wall Street Journal for Libel, Seeks $12.64
Million</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former editor for The Wall Street Journal sued
the newspaper Tuesday for $12.64 million, claiming he was fired and
his reputation smeared by a false charge of plagiarism.
   Jonathan Kandell, the Journal's assistant foreign editor prior
to his dismissal May 2, also demanded the return of notes and other
documents that he contended the paper's editors had kept, knowing
they would support his position.
   The Journal fired Kandell, 43, after accusing him of lifting
uncredited material from another writer's book for a page 1 article
about three private entrepreneurs in eastern Europe.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., owners of the
Journal, said, ``Dow Jones believes the suit is utterly without
merit and the company intends to defend itself vigorously.''
   Kandell quoted Paul Steiger, deputy managing editor of the
Journal, as having said his alleged offense was ``the most serious
transgression to take place at the Journal since the Foster Winans
case.''
   R. Foster Winans was convicted in 1985 of using his position as
a Wall Street Journal columnist to profit from insider stock
trading information. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison, a
$5,000 fine and five years' probation.
   In his lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District court in
Manhattan, Kandell contends he was libeled and his professional
reputation destroyed by the Journal. He demanded $10 million in
punitive damages and $2.64 million in compensation for ``willful,
wanton and reckless disregard of the truth'' and ``actual malice''
on the paper's part.
   He said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the
newspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the same
subject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper Village
Voice about Kandell's case. The Voice was not named as a defendant
in the suit.
   Kandell's article, in the March 30 edition of the Journal,
profiled a Soviet machine tool maker, a Czechoslovak inventor and a
Hungarian banker as examples of individuals succeeding in the
private sector.
   Kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three
individuals in their countries after hearing them speak at a
meeting in New York last November, sponsored by the Council on
Foreign Relations.
   He said that at the same meeting, he also learned of a book,
``Communist Entrepreneurs,'' and met the author, John W. Kiser III.
He said he later ``read the book once and put it aside.''

<HEAD>Preacher Given Probation in PTL Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last of six defendants in the PTL
scandal was placed on three years' probation for lying to a federal
grand jury in denying he took Jessica Hahn to a hotel to have sex
with TV evangelist Jim Bakker.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Tuesday also ordered John
Wesley Fletcher to observe eight months of curfew from 8 p.m. to
5:30 a.m.
   The 50-year-old former preacher from Durham pleaded guilty
earlier this month to perjury. Under federal guidelines, he faced 6
to 12 months in prison.
   ``I feel fortunate not to have to go to prison,'' he said as he
left the courthouse. ``I was scared. I was petrified.''
   Four other defendants _ Bakker, top PTL deputy Richard Dortch,
Bakker aide David Taggart and his brother and PTL decorator James
Taggart _ are in prison.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year term for fraud and conspiracy. He
was convicted last year of fleecing his followers of millions in
donations to his evangelical empire, which collapsed after his
sexual encounter with Ms. Hahn became known.
   Perjury charges against a fifth defendant, former PTL pastor Sam
Johnson, were dropped.
   Once a favored guest on Bakker's TV show, Fletcher appeared
twice before a grand jury. The first time, in 1987, he denied that
he took Ms. Hahn, a church secretary, to a Clearwater Beach, Fla.,
hotel in 1980 to have sex with Bakker.
   A year later, Fletcher testified that Bakker had asked him to
``get me a woman'' and that he brought Ms. Hahn there to have sex
with Bakker.
   On Tuesday, Fletcher, who now does roofing work, cried as he
stood before the judge. He said only, ``I'm sorry.''
   Defense attorney George Laughrun said Fletcher was on an
anti-depressant when he first appeared before the grand jury and
twice attempted suicide.
   ``He has seen rock bottom and is working his way back up,''
Laughrun told the judge. ``Give him credit for coming in and
pleading guilty.''

   Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher was sentenced
to three years' probation Tuesday after pleading guilty to charges
of lying to a grand jury about the reasons he introduced PTL
founder Jim Bakker to Jessica Hahn.
   Fletcher is the last of six defendants to get his day in court
after the 1987 PTL scandal. Bakker resigned from the television
ministry following reports of his sexual encounter Ms. Hahn she was
paid to keep quiet about the encounter.
   Fletcher, who now does roofing work, cried as he stood before
U.S. District Judge Robert Potter.
   ``I feel fortunate not to have to go to prison,'' Fletcher, 50,
said as he left the courthouse. ``I was scared. I was petrified.''
   Four other defendants _ Bakker, top PTL deputy Richard Dortch,
Bakker's personal aide David Taggart and his brother and PTL
interior decorator James Taggart _ are in prison.
   Perjury charges against the fifth defendant, former PTL pastor
Sam Johnson, were dropped.
   Fletcher was accused of lying to the special grand jury that
investigated the ministry's operations under Bakker's leadership.
Perjury is punishable by five years in prison, but under federal
sentencing guidelines, Fletcher faced from 6 months to 12 months in
prison.
   Potter told the former preacher to observe an eight-month
curfew, remaining in his home in Durham from 8 p.m. until 5:30 a.m.
   In keeping with a plea bargain struck earlier this month,
prosecutors supported his request for a light sentence.
   Fletcher was a regular guest on Bakker's television show and had
met Ms. Hahn when he conducted revival services on Long Island,
N.Y., where she was a church secretary.
   Fletcher told the grand jury during one appearance that he
didn't introduce Bakker and Ms. Hahn with the idea that they would
have sex. But during another appearance before the grand jury,
Fletcher said that sex was the motive behind the introduction and
that Bakker had told him to ``Get me a woman.'''

<HEAD>10 Coast Guardsmen Targeted in Drug-Smuggling Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Coast Guardsman assigned to a ship near
President Bush's summer retreat in Maine is among 10 current or
former servicemen targeted in a federal drug-smuggling
investigation, according to Coast Guard officials.
   Commandant Paul Yost told a news conference Tuesday that one of
the servicemen was relieved of duties Friday when Yost learned that
a two-year-old Justice Department investigation was still active.
   Yost said at a news conference that those being investigated
included four current and six former guardsmen.
   Yost did not specify which active-duty guardsman had been
relieved of duty. He said he would discuss with the U.S. attorney's
office how to handle the three other active servicemen.
   The admiral declined to identify any of those involved in the
investigation or to give details of possible crimes committed. Yost
said he did not learn of the inquiry until after NBC News
interviewed him on Friday. The network reported that indictments
were pending.
   The serviceman on the ship off Maine was not involved in the
president's security detail, Yost said.
   ``He was assigned to a vessel that could've been used as a
backup to that security detail from time to time,'' he said. ``The
vessel had not been so used that I know of, but it could've been.''
   Coast Guard spokesman Jack O'Dell said the case stems from the
conviction of four guardsmen in 1988 for selling drugs and passing
information to smugglers. Investigators have been interviewing
those convicted, O'Dell said.
   All of those involved in the continuing inquiry were stationed
in Islamorada, Fla., at the time of the earlier charges, O'Dell
said.
   The commandant said he was telling the truth when he told NBC he
was not aware of any inquiry or any pending indictments against
members of the Coast Guard.
   Since then, he said, he learned of ``Operation Tempest,'' an
ongoing investigation by the Justice Department's Organized Crime
Drug Enforcement Task Force.
   ``I am disappointed that any Coast Guard personnel are
involved,'' Yost said. ``We will ensure they are prosecuted and
punished.''
   He said nearly all of the 38,000 men and women in the service,
which is part of the Transportation Department, are serving
honorably.

   Marlon Brando spoke of his family's ``acute
misery'' after a judge refused to set bail for his son, who is
charged with murdering his half-sister's boyfriend.
   ``There's no way to describe it to you unless you've gone
through it in your life. We must just be strong, and the family,
with love and supporting each other, will prevail,'' the reclusive
actor told reporters.
   The white-haired Brando sat in the front row of the packed
courtroom Tuesday and stared straight ahead as his son, Christian,
was brought in.
   William Kunstler, the civil rights attorney summoned by the
elder Brando to defend his son, said the shooting of Dag Drollet,
26, at the Brando estate last week was an accident and that
Christian Brando was drunk at the time.
   But Municipal Judge Rosemary Shumsky denied bail.
   Christian Brando, 32, is a welder and tree-trimmer. Drollet was
the boyfriend of Cheyenne Brando, 20.
   ``To those people who do not know the nature of this acute
misery that both our families suffer, no explanation is possible,''
Marlon Brando said.

legislator who wants labels on records containing objectionable

   Granda said Tuesday he doesn't have time to campaign against
Rep. Jean Dixon in the August primary because of a busy concert

hits ``If You Want To Get To Heaven'' and ``Jackie Blue.''
   Mrs. Dixon, a first-term Republican, is seeking warning labels

   Granda, 39, said he still considers record labeling censorship.
He said he supports Connie Wible, one of two remaining opponents of
Mrs. Dixon in the Republican race.

<HEAD>Cuomo Will Seek Re-election, Aides Say; GOP Still Without a
Candidate</HEAD>

   With Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo reported to
be on the verge of announcing for re-election, New York Republicans
are still looking for a well-known challenger.
   Cuomo, widely viewed as a potential contender in the 1992
presidential election, has decided to seek a third four-year term,
aides said Tuesday. They said the announcement could come within
the next few days.
   The Republicans find themselves without a standardbearer at a
time when Cuomo is considered vulnerable because of rising taxes
and continuing budget deficits. The state GOP convention is next
week; Democrats meet to nominate their slate the following week.
   State Republican Chairman J. Patrick Barrett called together his
top-level candidate search team Tuesday night. But after a
four-hour session, Barrett aide Elizabeth DelTorto said, ``There's
nothing new to report.''
   ``There are some new people Pat will be talking to tomorrow,''
DelTorto said. She refused to say who they were.
   On Saturday, Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappleyea turned
down the GOP recruiters, and on Tuesday, former state GOP Chairman
Richard Rosenbaum all but ruled himself out of the race.
   So far, the only announced candidate for the GOP nomination is
little-known insurance broker Herbert Holland from Rockland County,
outside New York City. He has never run for office and has little
support among the GOP leadership.
   Under consideration by Republican leaders, largely because of
strong support within the state's tiny Conservative Party, is New
York University professor Herbert London. He briefly sought the GOP
nomination for mayor of New York City last year.
   London hasn't announced for governor. Nonetheless, DelTorto said
London was ``certainly still among the top finalists.''
   The governor, at a New York City appearance Tuesday, would not
comment on his intentions. But Cuomo, who already has more than $7
million in his campaign warchest, has said in recent months he
expects to seek re-election.
   He has said there's no other job he'd rather be doing now. He
also has said that with the state's fiscal problems, it's no time
to be quitting.
   Cuomo and the Legislature, in the face of a third straight year
of budget deficits, just adopted a budget that raises taxes a
record $1.8 billion.
   While not confirming what the other advisers said about the
governor's intentions, Andrew Cuomo, the governor's son and chief
political adviser, called it ``a pretty safe story.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush is asking Israeli security
forces to restrain themselves in confronting Palestinians mounting
angry protests over a weekend massacre.
   Bush emphasized his concern on Tuesday by extending personal
sympathy to the families of all Palestinians killed in the
spiraling violence.
   His condolences were pointedly expressed to both the families of
the 13 Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces since the
violence began as well as to the families of the seven Palestinian
workers slain by an allegedly deranged Israeli gunman on Sunday.
   Bush's gesture comes amid rising discontent inside the Bush
administration over the course of events in Israel.
   The discontent centers not only on the loss of life suffered
during the Israeli crackdown on rioting Palestinians this week but
also on Israel's seeming reluctance to enter a dialogue with
Palestinian representatives.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that while
Bush was anguished at the murders of the seven Palestinian workers,
he is also ``deeply troubled by the violent aftermath to these
deaths.''
   ``Besides expressing condolences to the families of all those
who have lost their lives amidst the subsequent violence, the
president calls upon the Israeli security forces as well as others
to act with maximum restraint,'' Fitzwater said. ``Additional
bloodshed and loss of life will only compound the tragedy.''
   But Fitzwater said Bush believes that simply deploring what
happened and calling for restraint is not enough.
   ``It is essential to address the political issues that lie at
the core of the region's strife,'' Fitzwater said and added:
   ``Based on experience, we believe that violence in the Middle
East will continue and possibly grow so long as there is an absence
of a promising peace process that nourishes hope amongst Israelis
and Palestinians alike.''
   The administration continues to believe, Fitzwater said, that
the initiative of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which the
administration has been trying to implement for months, offers the
best path to a negotiating process productive for both Israelis and
Palestinians alike.
   Shamir repeatedly refused to endorse U.S. suggestions for an
Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo to start implementing the
initiative. His government collapsed over the issue.
   Both Shamir, leader of the Likud coalition, and Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres have been unable so far to form a new
government.
   ``We look forward to the quick emergence of an Israeli
government that is capable of making decisions on issues of peace
and is committed, just as we are, to moving ahead on the peace
process,'' Fitzwater said.

   Twelve-year-old David Opont, given only a 50-50
shot at survival 3{ months ago after a neighborhood bully allegedly
set him on fire, could walk out of the hospital before the end of
the month.
   ``He's come a long way. We expect him to be released shortly _
possibly within the next week,'' said Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman
for the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
   The Brooklyn boy has been in the hospital, undergoing four skin
grafts and therapy, since he was torched on March 7. Doctors said
then if his recovery went perfectly, he would be out in four months.
   But his release from the burn unit will send David into another
world that relatives say is just as scary to the boy: the legal
system.
   David may have to testify against the 13-year-old who allegedly
torched him in an abandoned building. A pretrial hearing for that
boy was set for today.
   David's lawyers also will need his help in preparing a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit to be filed on his behalf.
   And eventually, he'll be back on the streets where he was
trapped, bound and burned.
   The future makes David nervous, said Guito Lavoile, 35, David's
cousin and a family spokesman. ``It's not a problem of him, it's a
problem of time. It's still too close to it all. The scars will not
go away easy,'' said Lavoile.
   ``If you ever happened to be a victim of a crime, you'd think
twice about going over it again. He was 50 percent dead. ...
There's no doubt that's how he feels.''
   David's parents, who brought their son here from Haiti in 1988,
speak little English. They have kept a daily vigil at the hospital,
as has their teen-age daughter Naomi.
   The boy was on his way to school when a bully forced him into a
building, tied him to a railing and set him afire, police said.
David, who allegedly was robbed by the same boy a day earlier,
suffered burns over 55 percent of his body.
   David initially told relatives he was torched because he refused
to smoke crack. But police filed no drug charges against the
suspect and now believe his only motive was being a bully.
   The alleged assailant was arrested hours after the attack and
has been jailed at a juvenile center.
   David was in critical condition for most of his hospitalization.
Doctors put his chances of survival at 50-50, fearing any
complication could kill him. He is now in stable condition, Manners
said, but faces years of treatment.
   He is badly scarred by the burns, does not have full use of one
arm and will go from the burn unit to a rehabilitation center. But
he already is taking short walks around the hospital and may speak
with reporters next week, Lavoile said.
   ``I think it's going to be amazing, to see him back as a normal
person, to see him back on the streets,'' his cousin said.
   David's plight touched hearts throughout the city and nation.
More than $280,000 poured into a fund established to cover his
medical expenses. He was visited by Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Bill
Cosby, Vice President Dan Quayle and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   David marked his 12th birthday one day after the attack, and the
hospital was flooded with hundreds of cards, gifts and flowers.
   Mayor David Dinkins, another visitor, used the boy as a metaphor
for the city in his May 11 call for racial harmony in New York.
   ``Like the city in which he lives, young David is suffering.
He's scarred and he struggles to overcome the damage that anger has
inflicted on him,'' the mayor said. Yet Dinkins saw a bright future
for the boy.
   ``When I see him, I see life in his eyes,'' he said. ``Despite
all he's seen, David's eyes are wide open, looking not behind him
in fright but ahead in the fond hope that he will heal and move
on.''

<HEAD>Form of Vitamin A Turns Cancer Cells into Normal Ones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a unique assault on leukemia, doctors have
found that a form of vitamin A will turn cancer cells into normal
ones.
   Medicine's usual way of combating cancer is to kill it. Doctors
administer powerful toxic drugs in the hopes that they will destroy
more cancerous cells than healthy ones.
   The new approach instead tries to reform cancer cells. It
changes the cells' genetic program, bypassing the genetic mix up
that makes them kill. In this way, the treatment induces the cancer
cells to live, to grow and eventually to die by the same rules that
govern the rest of the body.
   The drug, a synthetic form of vitamin A called all-trans
retinoic acid, was developed in China and tested in France. Though
it has drawbacks and works in just one rare form of leukemia,
doctors hope it will provide clues for short-circuiting the basic
errors that underlie all cancers.
   ``The dogma has been to try to kill cancer cells,'' said Dr.
Laurent Degos. ``Is it possible to change a cell, and not kill it,
so it becomes normal?''
   Degos, a researcher at Hopital Saint-Louis in Paris, presented
evidence that this indeed is possible in a report Tuesday at the
annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   He tested the drug on victims of acute promyelocytic leukemia, a
rare blood cancer that strikes a few hundred people in the United
States each year. All of them had failed earlier standard therapy.
   He achieved complete, though often temporary, elimination of all
signs of the disease in 16 of 17 patients who had relapsed for the
first time. There was complete remission in one of four patients
who had relapsed a second time.
   ``There was no killing of cells, but they change,'' said Degos.
``We see more mature cells.''
   This form of leukemia is caused by a specific genetic defect,
the mislocation of a piece of one string of genes, or chromosome,
onto another chromosome. As a result, the cells get stuck in their
juvenile stage. They fail to mature normally and eventually die.
   Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid appears to bump the cells
past this roadblock in their development so they grow old.
   ``This is a smashing development,'' commented Dr. Charles
Schiffer of the University of Maryland. ``It has impressed even the
most cynical. This is a different approach to anything we have done
in this disease in the past.''
   Dr. Bruce Chesen of the National Cancer Institute said the
institute plans soon to sponsor four small safety studies of the
drug. Once those are done, it will begin a larger review of its
effectiveness.
   Though the synthetic vitamin wiped out obvious signs of the
leukemia, the disease frequently came back, apparently because some
cancer cells were resistant to the drug. Degas said it may be
necessary to combine the treatment with standard chemotherapy to
try to obliterate the few remaining cancer cells.
   The drug was developed in China by Wang Zeng Yi, dean of
Shanghai University II, a French-speaking medical school. It is now
being produced by Hoffman LaRoche, the pharmaceutical firm.
   In an earlier report, doctors said they found that the acne
medicine Accutane, another synthetic form of vitamin A, prevents
new tumors from developing in people treated for smoking-related
throat cancer.
   Among other research presented at the meeting:
   _Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute
outlined the first results of his pioneering attempt to insert
foreign genes into cancer patients. The initial effort, carried out
on seven melanoma patients, was intended to show that gene therapy
is possible.
   Doctors removed cancer-fighting blood cells from the patients'
tumors, inserted a bacteria gene into them and then put them back
into the patients' bodies. The manipulated cells zeroed in on their
tumors. The doctors hope soon to repeat the experiment, this time
inserting a gene that produces a cancer-killing chemical called
tumer necrosis factor.
   _A survey of American and Caribbean blacks in central Brooklyn
showed that a surprising 4 percent were infected with
cancer-causing human T-cell leukemia virus Type 1, or HTLV-I. Dr.
Harvey Dosik of Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn said the
infection rate is 200 times higher than that seen nationwide in
blood donors.
   _Dr. Lode J. Swinnen of Loyola University in Chicago said he had
found evidence that OKT3, an antibody treatment widely given to
recipients of organ transplants, significantly increases their risk
of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer. He reviewed 154 heart
transplant patients and found that 11 percent of those getting OKT3
since 1986 had developed the disease.

   The ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee is threatening a delay in the confirmation of a
top Pentagon nominee until a dispute over civilian oversight of
intelligence activities is resolved.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia expressed concern Tuesday over a
classified memorandum in which the head of Special Operations
Command proposed sole Defense Department oversight of military
intelligence actions.
   ``Prior approval process of these activities now involve
agencies other than the Defense Department, as it should,'' Warner
said. ``But reportedly under the proposal only the secretary of
defense, on behalf of the National Command Authority, would have to
approve such activities.''
   The memo was written by Gen. James Lindsay, commander of the
Special Operations Command.
   Warner told Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner, President Bush's choice to
replace Lindsay, that the issue of civilian oversight could hold up
his confirmation to the Defense Department post.
   ``It may well be that this senator feels that that issue is
going to have to be resolved prior to such time as this committee
completes the work on your nomination,'' Warner told Stiner.
   The nominee said he was not familiar with the memo but promised
an immediate review and recommendation to Powell after his
confirmation.
   The controversy centers on the Defense Department's Special
Operations, a combatant command of specially trained Defense
Department forces who operate in peace or war. The units can either
support conventional forces or act in their place.
   Warner expressed concerns that the defining of activities as
intelligence gathering would be done without oversight from
agencies other than the Defense Department.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said he shared Warner's concerns and the ranking members of the
Senate's Intelligence Committee harbor similar misgivings.
   ``We want to make sure that our special operations forces have
the right kind of intelligence,'' Nunn said. ``We want to make sure
that the CIA does its job. We want to make sure that intelligence
areas of the Defense Department do their job but we also absolutely
insist that the civilian oversight of those intelligence activities
not be lost.
   ``That's the bottom line,'' Nunn said.

<HEAD>FDIC Lost Money in 1989, Following Larger Loss in 1988</HEAD>

   For only the second time in its history, the
federal fund that insures deposits at the nation's banks lost money
in 1989.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported that its insurance
fund lost $851 million in 1989 following an even bigger loss of
$4.24 billion in 1988.
   The back-to-back losses were blamed on a post-Depression record
number of bank failures. In 1988, 221 banks failed or required
government assistance to remain open. That number declined only
slightly to 207 in 1989.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman estimated Tuesday that 150 to
175 banks probably would fail this year but that the fund still
should be able to return to profitability if none of the failures
involves a large institution.
   However, he conceded that his estimate was highly dependent on
the health of the overall economy.
   ``Much depends on future interest rates and future real estate
markets,'' he told reporters.
   A big part of the 1989 loss was blamed on the failure of the
20-bank MCorp. based in Dallas, which it is estimated will cost the
government $2 billion, making it the second biggest bank failure in
history.
   Last year's loss to the FDIC fund came because the agency was
forced to pay out more to take over the failed banks than it
received in insurance premiums paid by healthy banks.
   For 1989, the FDIC had liquidation expenses of $4.13 billion.
That compared to $7.36 billion it spent on failed banks in 1988.
   ``Although the bank fund declined in 1989, the drop was
considerably less severe than the previous year,'' Seidman said.
   A financial institution becomes insolvent when the value of its
assets, primarily in the form of loans it makes, drops below the
level of its liabilities, represented by its customers' deposits.
   The amount of money left in the bank insurance fund at the end
of 1989 was $13.21 billion. That represented 0.7 percent of insured
deposits, far below the 1.25 percent level set as a goal by
Congress.
   By comparison, in 1987 the FDIC fund stood at $18.3 billion,
representing 1.10 percent of insured deposits, during a year when
193 banks failed or required government assistance.
   Despite the losses in 1988 and 1989, analysts said they believed
the FDIC would be able to escape the sort of trouble that beset the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the sister fund set up to
insure deposits at savings and loan institutions.
   A record number of S&amp;L failures pushed the FSLIC into
insolvency, forcing Congress to step in with the costliest bailout
in U.S. history.
   Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution said he believed
Congress had learned some painful lessons from the S&amp;L crisis and
would act quickly to prevent a similar occurrence in the banking
fund.
   ``In order for this situation to be like the thrifts, you would
have to have both a recession and a congressional refusal to
recognize reality,'' he said.
   He said Congress and the administration were slow to respond to
the S&amp;L crisis, forcing regulators to keep sick S&amp;Ls open while
their losses mounted, making the ultimate bailout costs even more
expensive.
   ``The key lesson we learned is don't delay,'' he said. ``The
thrift crisis got out of hand because Congress and the regulators
did not act.''

   TV viewers can't get enough of ``America's
Funniest Home Videos.''
   The deep desire to watch ourselves being ourselves _ as recorded
by ourselves _ lifted the ABC show into the No. 1 spot in the
ratings last week, according to figures released Tuesday by the
A.C. Nielsen Co.
   On Monday, as part of its preview of the fall season, the
network announced it had finally come up with a companion for its
top-rated show _ ``America's Funniest ... Part II.'' The shows will
run back-to-back, proving that imitation is the sincerest form of
cashing in on hit programming.
   During the Sunday night show, $100,000 was awarded to the best
video submitted during the season. The grand prize went to a clip
of a man who snagged and lost his pants on a fence as he tried to
catch a baseball.
   As the May ``sweeps'' period comes to a close, NBC recaptured
first place from CBS, which landed the No. 1 spot for the first
time in two years for the week ended May 13. Ratings during the
sweeps period are used to set ad rates.
   For the week ended May 20, CBS was back in its usual last place
with an 11.2 average. ABC was second with 11.5 and NBC led with
11.7. Each ratings point represents 921,000 households.
   Repeats of NBC's ``Cheers'' and ABC's ``Roseanne'' came in
second and third, respectively. And reruns of ``The Cosby Show''
and its spinoff, ``A Different World,'' both on NBC, ranked fourth
and fifth.
   CBS had three shows in the top 10 _ ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women'' and ``60 Minutes.''
   The season finale of NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' which saw the yuppie
law firm hold on to heartthrob actor Harry Hamlin after teasing
viewers with his apparent departure, rose to ninth place.
   Friday's two-hour movie ``Return to Green Acres,'' reuniting
Arnold the Pig, Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor, won its time slot on
CBS with an 11.8 average.
   The murky, much-hyped soap opera ``Twin Peaks,'' tied for 40th
place. No matter. ABC announced ``Twin Peaks'' will be back in the
fall, bad ratings or no.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 25.2; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 18.9;
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 17.7; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 17.4; ``A
Different World,'' NBC, 17.1; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, 16.8;
``Designing Women,'' CBS, 16.7; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie Perry
Mason: The Case of the Silenced Singer,'' NBC, 16.5; ``L.A. Law,''
NBC, 16; and ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 15.8.
   ``Elvis'' on ABC is really dead and so are its ratings. The
network canceled the show and with apparent good reason. It tied
for last place at No. 83 with ``Booker'' on Fox.
   In the news battle, ABC and Peter Jennings were No. 1, with a
9.6 average. Dan Rather and CBS were No. 2 with 8.5, followed by
NBC and Tom Brokaw with 8.3.

<HEAD>Senators Agreeing On Need To Limit Independent Campaign Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key senators working on campaign finance
reform are finding common ground in a desire to curb how much money
special interest groups can spend independently on behalf of a
candidate.
   Leading Republican and Democratic lawmakers also agreed behind
closed doors Tuesday to cut the rates broadcasters charge for
political ads and to jointly tackle millionaire candidates' use of
their fortunes to finance their races.
   ``There are some areas we have a good chance of agreeing on,''
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., head of the five-member GOP team, said
Tuesday after the first of what are expected to be dozens of closed
meetings over the next several weeks. ``We tried not to harp on the
areas of disagreement.''
   McConnell and Oklahoma Sen. David Boren, head of the Democratic
negotiating team, said members of both parties have been victims of
11th-hour TV ads on behalf of a candidate by so-called independent
political action committees.
   ``In very general terms, neither side is very happy with
independent expenditures,'' McConnell said.
   As an example, he cited the hundreds of thousands of dollars an
imported car dealers' PAC poured into key House and Senate races in
1988 on the basis of how candidates had voted on trade issues.
   The negotiations taking place in an office just off the Senate
floor are aimed at preventing campaign finance reform efforts from
degenerating into a Democrat vs. Republican fight like it did two
years ago.
   Boren said they will be patterned along the two months of
private meetings earlier this year that produced a compromise clean
air bill passed by the Senate last month and being debated this
week in the House.
   ``We've not set a particular time frame,'' Boren said. ``But
we're going to operate under a rule that no decision is final until
everything is final. Obviously some decisions on individual items
will depend on what the overall framework of an agreement is.''
   Democrats have insisted that any reform proposal must contain
fixed state-by-state ceilings on how much candidates can spend. A
majority of Republicans reject campaign ceilings and are demanding
measures to curb Democrats' historic reliance on unions for their
get-out-the-vote efforts.
   Both bills contain provisions that would prohibit TV and radio
stations from charging candidates campaign ad rates often two to
three times higher than what commercial advertisers pay.
   To prevent millionaire candidates from using their fortunes to
overwhelm opponents in a spending race, Senate Democrats would
impose a $20,000 ceiling on the amount an office seeker can
personally spend on his or her campaign.
   Republicans approach the issue from the other direction,
requiring a wealthy candidate to say well before an election how
much of his own money he plans to spend on the race.
   If it is more than $250,000, the Republican measure would allow
an opponent to tap wealthy contributors up to $5,000 each instead
of the current $1,000 ceiling on individual contributions. If a
candidate spends more than $1 million of his or her own money,
there would be no limit on how much a wealthy benefactor could
contribute to an opponent.

<HEAD>Report Recommends Cutting Conventional Forces While Boosting NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States can respond to the lessening
Soviet threat by significantly reducing its conventional forces but
must strengthen its European alliances, says a congressional study.
   The report recommended that the Bush administration consider
``parallel paths'' of continued reliance on NATO and attempts to
make arrangements, such as the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, stronger.
   ``Along one path, the United States could seek to revise NATO's
policies, doctrines and forces to take into account the new
political and military situation in Europe,'' said the report by
the Congressional Research Service.
   The report suggested that strengthening of the CSCE could be
done by a legal treaty foundation and institutionalizing
conventional arms control negotiations.
   ``Both goals could be adopted at a CSCE summit later in 1990,''
said the report released on Tuesday.
   In light of the push toward democracy in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, the United States will be able to reduce its military
forces in Europe from more than 300,000 to less than 100,000 by the
middle of the decade, the report said.
   U.S. influence in Europe would depend more on its political and
economic roles rather than military strength.
   Stanley R. Sloan, senior specialist in International Security
Policy at the Congressional Research Service, prepared the report
at the request of Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   Nunn said the study ``offers a thoughtful and well-reasoned set
of policy prescriptions for U.S. and allied decision-makers to
ponder as they prepare for the July NATO summit in London.''

   Two Hindu brides, their vision
obstructed by long veils, married the wrong men _ giving new
meaning to the expression ``Love is blind.''
   The Times of India said today that two marriage parties arrived
at the same time Tuesday in Patan village in the central Indian
state of Madhya Pradesh.
   The ceremonies were rushed, and the long veils obscured the
brides' vision, preventing them from picking out their true
fiances, the report said.
   Following Hindu tradition, one bride circled a fire with a
bridegroom seven times, sealing the marriage. The other bride then
completed ``the seven steps'' with the second bridegroom, the paper
said.
   When they lifted their veils, the brides discovered they had
married the wrong men.
   But village elders said that ``the seven perambulations around
the sacred fire'' were final and there could be no exchange of
spouses, the paper said.
   Most marriages in rural India are arranged, especially among
Hindus who comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.

<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency study still
under scientific review suggests that there is increasing evidence
of a link between heavy electrical currents and some types of
cancer.
   The study, an EPA official said Tuesday, shows that research
over the last decade has established at least a tentative
connection between leukemia and some other cancers, and the slowly
varying magnetic fields created by powerful alternating electric
currents.
   Richard Guimond, director of EPA's Office of Radiation, said the
report has no original research, but rather is a review of a
variety of scientific studies of the human body effects of
long-term exposure to magnetic fields created by power lines.
   At one time, he said, studies showed no link between electrical
current and human cancer. The new report, however, said Guimond,
``suggests that there is in fact stronger and stronger evidence
being developed as more and more of these studies are done.''
   After the report is reviewed by a group of scientists, it will
be available for public review sometime this summer, probably in
July, he said.
   Until then, he said, ``We can't say that it is final and what
the final conclusions are going to be.''

   Romania's newly formed government tolerated
violence and voter intimidation before last Sunday's national
elections, says the co-leader of an international observer team.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., just back from Bucharest after
monitoring Romania's first free elections in 53 years, said Tuesday
the United States should supply humanitarian aid immediately. But
he said further aid should be conditioned on the new government's
ability to move toward democracy.
   ``There was a lot of unfairness in the pre-election process,''
Lieberman told reporters. ``Some of it was intentional by the
government party and some of it was unintentional.''
   A problem facing the opposition parties, he said, was a lack of
time to organize a campaign against the governing party, which
dominated media outlets.
   ``What happened on Sunday was a significant step forward toward
democracy but there is a lot more to be done,'' Lieberman said.
``They've come a long way; they deserve some help. But they also
need some pressure to continue to move toward more human rights,
more political freedom, and greater recognition of the rights of
minorities, particularly Hungarians.''

<HEAD>Minorities Underrepresented in Peace Corps, Congress Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 30 years after the Peace Corps was
founded by President John F. Kennedy, the General Accounting Office
says the agency is still perceived as a white middle-class
institution.
   Only about 7 percent of the agency's roughly 6,300 volunteers
are minorities, a congressional investigative agency found. And
through 1988, no minorities held any of the top 20 management jobs
at the agency.
   ``Efforts to improve the Peace Corps' minority profile in the
past have been short-lived and costly,'' the GAO said Tuesday. It
called for a long-term strategy to correct the problem.
   The underrepresentation of minorities in the Peace Corps has
made it difficult for the agency to teach foreign peoples about the
racially diverse American culture, the study said.
   Congressional researchers acknowledged, however, that the Peace
Corps ``has historically experienced great difficulty attracting
sufficient number of minorities to serve as volunteers.''
   Part of the problem stems from the lower economic status of
blacks and other minorities, the study said, who ``believe that
they cannot afford to volunteer two years of their lives to Peace
Corps service.''
   But it said minorities also ``tend to see the Peace Corps as a
white middle-class organization.''

<TEXT>
   A judge says he will visit an exhibit of
Robert Mapplethorpe photographs before considering a request to
dismiss obscenity charges against the art gallery showing the
pictures.
   Municipal Judge David Albanese also set a hearing for Thursday
to consider a request for changes that would make the indictment
against the Contemporary Arts Center conform to U.S. Supreme Court
obscenity standards.
   The judge said Tuesday he will view the photos before the
six-week exhibit closes Saturday.
   H. Louis Sirkin, a lawyer for the Arts Center, applauded the
decision. Defense lawyers argue that the 175-photo exhibit doesn't
violate obscenity standards when viewed as a whole. Seven pictures
were cited by prosecutors.
   The lawyer said he will oppose attempts by prosecutors to alter
the indictment against the museum and its director, Dennis Barrie.
Sirkin said any changes must come from a grand jury, not a judge.
   Barrie and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity and
using children in material involving nudity. If convicted they face
$6,000 in fines, and Barrie also faces six months in jail.
   More than 67,000 people have seen the exhibit.
   A showing of Mapplethorpe's photos in Washington stirred
national debate last year over government support of the arts. At
the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Congress barred funding for
certain sexually explicit works.
   The museum and its director argue that the judge should dismiss
the charges because the photographs are art.
   Senior Assistant City Prosecutor Frank H. Prouty Jr. said the
city wants the indictment to specify that two pictures of nude
children in the exhibit include ``a lewd, graphic exhibition of the
genitals.''
   The indictment issued April 7 says the exhibit includes ``a
photograph of a minor male child ... with his genitals exposed, and
a photograph of a minor female child ... with her genitals
exposed.''
   Prouty also asked to add a phrase alleging that five pictures of
sex acts in the exhibit are obscene under the three-part test
established by the Supreme Court in a 1973 decision.
   That decision said that to be ruled obscene, material must
violate local community standards, depict clearly offensive sexual
conduct and lack artistic value.
   The judge also agreed to accept a brief filed by the Cincinnati
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in favor of
dismissing the charges.

   Investigators ruled out a design flaw in
the collapse of five 50-foot steel beams that killed three workers
at Ohio State University.
   But officials said it may take weeks to determine the cause of
Tuesday morning's accident, which also injured a worker.
   The workers were erecting a four-story glass and granite
building that will house a state computer center.They were on the
roof bolting on a 10-foot cantilever, a section of beam that
extends outward without the support of a vertical column, said
Richard T. Lombardi, vice president of Turner Construction.
   The cantilever fell, causing five beams to drop, Lombardi said.
He estimated 75 to 100 workers were in the area at the time.
   The worker who was injured was listed in fair condition.
   An official of the Ohio Department of Industrial Relations said
the deaths were caused by human error or structural failure.
   ``It's real hard to tell how it happened,'' said Elmer Waltz,
chief of the factory and building division. ``But design had
nothing to do with the accident.''
   Waltz said the accident could have been caused by a worker
misdirecting the crane moving the steel or by a bolt shearing away
from one of the beams.

   The dollar ended sharply lower against the yen
Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
moderately higher.
   The dollar closed at 151.35 yen, down 1.05 yen from Tuesday's
152.40-yen finish. The currency opened at 151.65 yen and ranged
between 150.60 yen and 152.00 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 238.21 points, or 0.75
percent, ending the day at 32,176.51.
   The price of the benchmark No.119 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 87.74 from Tuesday's close of 87.45. That dropped the
yield to 7.015 percent from 7.075 percent.
   ``Trading was very rough,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a currency
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   She said the dollar, which started lower in Tokyo following its
overnight decline in New York, fell further as market players
bought the yen against the West German mark, as well as the dollar,
for technical adjustments.
   ``But the market has not determined the dollar's direction, and
it is unlikely to fall below the 150-yen line, where investors tend
to pick up the U.S. currency.'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Stock traders attributed the Nikkei's gain to index-linked
buying in early trading as well as to the yen's recovery against
the dollar. They said participants bought issues in the spot market
to take profits from price gaps between the spot and the futures
market.

   Few here were surprised by the
landslide victory of Interim President Ion Iliescu. Although the
opposition claimed vote fraud, Iliescu's success appears more a
result of the nation's Communist past and its desire for stability.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front, who have dominated the
government since the December revolution that ousted dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, will be the first ex-Communists to triumph in
Eastern Europe's current series of multiparty elections.
   With nearly all ballots counted Tuesday night, Iliescu had
captured 86 percent of the vote and the National Salvation Front
had more than two-thirds of the seats in the two-chamber Parliament.
   Iliescu's challengers _ the National Liberal Party's Radu
Campeanu and the National Peasant Party's Ion Ratiu _ claimed the
campaign was undemocratic, and that the voting process was
manipulated by the Front in a manner reminiscent of falsified
elections under the former regime.
   But while many of the 500-odd foreign observers agreed that the
election had some flaws, most appear to believe the results should
be accepted.
   Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers of New Mexico, the official U.S.
government observer, called the poll ``a good election'' and ``a
very giant step toward toward democracy.''
   Harry McCubbin, a British Labor Party parliamentarian, noted
that ``the size of the results we're getting would indicate that
any errors at the poll would not have made any difference in the
result whatsoever.''
   More than 85 percent of the 16 million eligible voters cast
ballots in Sunday's election, the first in which people had a
choice in decades.
   The victorious Front portrays itself as a modern
social-democratic party, but critics say it is merely a renamed
version of the Romanian Communist Party.
   Because of its close identification with December's uprising,
the Front won a legitimacy lacked by other reformed communists.
   Most Romanians view Iliescu primarily as the kindly but
authoritative figure who announced the arrest of Ceausescu while
bullets flew outside the revolutionary headquarters at the TV
studio Dec. 22 _ risking his life to bring the country its first
breath of freedom in decades.
   Iliescu, who was a Communist minister under Ceausescu in the
early 1970s, now argues vehemently that communism is dead in
Romania.
   When intellectuals accuse the Front of ``neo-communism,'' they
are referring less to discredited economic theories than to the
suffocating, bureaucratic mentality they associate with the old
regime.
   Indeed, while the Communist Party as an institution is gone and
many of the more visible leaders have been dismissed or punished,
the old bureaucracy is still firmly in place.
   Iliescu's inner circle is itself divided between older members
with links to the Ceausescu regime and younger types, with a more
Western orientation, who press for more radical change.
   This generation gap appears to be widespread. In many cases
younger people voted for the Liberals or Peasant Party, while their
parents, wary of a real upheaval which might threaten their jobs,
opted for the Front.
   The long years of oppression worked to the Front's advantage as
well.
   Bowing to authorities is firmly ingrained in many Romanians.
Some, especially in rural and outlying areas, found it difficult to
conceive of voting for anyone but the party in power.
   Romania's media are still controlled by the state, and the
opposition parties have accused the Front of manipulating TV
coverage to its advantage and of causing the paper and ink
shortages and distribution problems that have plagued their
newspapers.
   While the Front denies this, Iliescu has prevented the
establishment of independent TV stations and alternatives to the
state-run publishing house.
   The opposition was hurt by organizational problems as well, one
of the reasons why it originally sought to delay elections.
   Iliescu benefited from the opposition's inability to unite
behind one candidate.
   Campeanu and Ratiu are elderly former exiles vulnerable to
charges that they did not understand the needs of today's Romania.
   Ratiu, who spent the past 50 years in England, alienated some
voters by emphasizing his ties to the West and his constant
references to ``my friend Maggie Thatcher.''
   The Front's ideologue, Silviu Brucan, said his party benefited
by ``giving the workers what Ceausescu didn't ... a 40-hour work
week ... here was a government that for the first time cared for
their basic needs.''
   The undecided voters, he said, saw the Front as ``the only party
they felt could ensure their desire for tranquility ... Romanians
had reached a point of saturation with violence and tension.''

   People who try to quit smoking on their own
succeed twice as often as those who enroll in programs, researchers
reported today.
   The reason may be that the help-seekers are largely hard-core
smokers, they said.
   A 1986 nationwide telephone survey of more than 13,000 adult
smokers showed that of those who tried to kick the habit within the
previous 10 years, 47.5 percent who tried solo succeeded up for a
year or more, the researchers said.
   Only 23.6 percent of those in kick-the-habit programs made it
for that long, the scientists said in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Thus smokers who try to quit on their own are more likely to
succeed, but programs serve a ``limited but important public health
role,'' researchers said.
   Such programs are treating ``the most addicted, most
hard-core,'' said Dr. Michael C. Fiore, head of the study. ``And
these hard-core smokers are most at risk for the terrible health
consequences of smoking,'' Fiore, a professor of medicine at the
University of Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview.
   Forty million Americans have stopped smoking, but more than 71
million are still puffing, up to a third of whom try to quit
annually, the researchers reported. Less than 10 percent succeed
each year, the researchers said.
   Overall, people who succeeded tended to be older and more
educated but were equally likely to be heavy smokers _ 25 or more
cigarettes a day _ as those who failed. More than 70 percent who
tried to quit had been urged to do so by a doctor.
   The American Cancer Society offers self-help material for
smokers trying to quit, including supporting the annual Great
American Smokeout. It also has its FreshStart kick-the-habit
program.
   That program recorded a 14 percent success rate in a recent
study, led by Dr. Harry A. Lando of the University of Minnesota,
who agreed with Fiore's assessment that such programs tend to draw
the most addicted smokers.
   But ``the best group programs get 40 percent success _ that is
for intense kind of treatment,'' Lando said.
   Smoking is blamed for 390,000 U.S. deaths a year. About 1.3
million smokers quit every year, but their ranks are being
replenished by 1 million people annually _ mostly young people _
who start smoking, Fiore said.
   Another report in today's JAMA said tobacco companies and
federal and state governments reap more than $500 million a year
from sales of tobacco products to minors, accounting for 3.3
percent of the domestic market.
   The estimate was based largely on federal surveys of smoking
patterns among youngsters, on tobacco company sales and profits and
on tax rates, said authors Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza of the University
of Massachusetts Medical School at Fitchburg and Joe B. Tye of
Baystate Medical Center in Springfield.
   Thomas Lauria, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, an industry
trade group, called the report a ``preposterous economic analysis.''
   He said the authors ``start off with the erroneous assumption
that the industry targets kids, and extrapolate from there.'' He
added, ``So they not only build sand castles in the air, they fly
flags up the sand castles.''

   When they first met 21 years ago on the deck of
the aircraft carrier USS Hornet, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and H.R.
``Bob'' Haldeman were at the pinnacles of their professions.
   Astronaut Aldrin had returned from the Apollo 11 lunar landing
with Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins. Haldeman, the chief of
staff to President Richard Nixon who had taken office six months
earlier, accompanied his boss to meet the returning heroes.
   The two men fell hard in the years after that July 24, 1969
meeting, one disgraced by scandal and the other suffering painful
personal trials.
   Now they've resurfaced together in the 1990s, pitching a hotel
and business complex in post-Cold War Moscow.
   Haldeman and Aldrin participated Tuesday in a signing ceremony
during a meeting of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council.
They represent Americom International Corp., an office technology
concern in Irvine, Calif., which will operate the facility along
with Radisson Hotels International of Minneapolis.
   The companies signed an agreement with the Soviet travel
organization Intourist to operate the 430-room, 165-office building
on the Moscow River. In addition to being the first U.S.-managed
hotel in the Soviet Union, it will also have direct satellite
communications links to the West, geared to business travelers.
   Aldrin, who suffered from depression, alcoholism and two
divorces after becoming the second man to walk on the moon, is now
an aerospace consultant.
   He described how he managed to be in the ``right place at the
right time'' 27 years ago in being selected for the U.S. space
program.
   ``And I look on this particular venture here _ to open up the
opportunities for East-West trade _ again as being an opportunity
coming my way, and Bob's, ... to be in the right place at the right
time,'' said Aldrin, 60.
   Haldeman, who was convicted of obstruction of justice and
conspiracy in the Watergate scandal, served 18 months in prison.
   He said he is in business along with several other small
entrepreneurs ``in a peculiarly wide range of things'' _ owning a
steakhouse franchise in Miami, a high-tech company in Santa
Barbara, Calif., called Conductive Rubber Technology, and a real
estate syndication business in Los Angeles.
   When asked if the Soviets he meets ever bring up that other
office and residential complex in his life _ Watergate _ Haldeman
stares and tersely answers no.
   ``The reaction I find here and really throughout all the world,
other than the United States, is only one of wonderment as to what
on earth the country could have been doing to throw that guy out on
what any other country regards as a ridiculous farce, rather than
anything of any major substance,'' he said.
   Haldeman also admits to being a fan of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   ``I can only say having observed one politician very closely
with a remarkable ability for survival and recovery, and watching
Gorbachev, I have utmost admiration for his political skills,'' he
said.

   A 37-year-old attorney who successfully
agitated against police torture in northern Mexico's Sinaloa state
was killed by unidentified gunmen, police said.
   Norma Corona Sapienz was shot Monday night near the Sinaloa
Autonomous University where she used to teach law, said Adriana
Leyva of the state judicial police.
   ``The impact of her death has been tremendous here,'' said
Leyva, also a spokeswoman for the state bar association. Coronal
Sapienz was president of the state bar here.
   Leyva spoke Tuesday in a telephone interview.
   A police report said Corona Sapienz's automobile was intercepted
by three gunmen in a pickup. It cited witnesses as saying two of
the men apparently tried to kidnap her, but she tried to flee on
foot.
   The two then opened fire, jumped back into the pickup truck and
fled, the report said. An autopsy indicated she was shot five times.
   Maj. Lorenzo Goroztiza, state judicial police commander, told
reporters 12 people in pickup trucks similar to that used by the
gunmen have been detained for questioning.
   Last week, the state legislature mandated 10 years imprisonment
for any police officer convicted of torture. The State Commission
for the Defense of Human Rights, which Corona Sapienz headed, had
long been pressing for such legislation.
   Sinaloa and its capital, Culiacan, have been major centers for
smuggling drugs to the United States. Murders and human rights
abuses are common.
   For the past two years, Corona Sapienz had been complaining to
journalists about receiving anonymous death threats.
   Corona Sapienz defended a fellow Sinaloa lawyer and three
Venezuelans charged with drug trafficking who were kidnapped and
killed under mysterious circumstances in February.
   State and federal judicial authorities claimed the lawyer, Jesus
Guemes Castro, and Venezuelans Victor Suate, Jose Vladimir Arzonaly
and Jose Glaciano Planchart were killed by drug traffickers in
retaliation for the murder of a drug baron's wife and daughter.
   The killings brought protests from the Venezuelan government.
Corona Sapienz publicly accused the federal attorney general's
office at the time of dragging its feet in investigating the
multiple murders.

   Wildlife officials went fishing for
answers when anglers started hauling in salmon from a trout pond.
   It turned out that two workers taking the salmon from a state
hatchery to protected waters in a reservoir had decided to
``liberate'' some of them, said Carl Prescott, deputy director of
the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   The 850 fish, their fins clipped for identification, were dumped
May 9 in Snow's Pond near the small town of Ware. Wildlife
officials heard about the salmon bonanza in Ware two days later,
Prescott said Tuesday.
   ``Somebody stopped by and saw all these kids having a whale of a
time of it and identified these fish as salmon and reported them to
us,'' Prescott said.
   The fish are landlocked salmon, which are about 6 to 9 inches
long, smaller than their better-known cousins, the Atlantic salmon.
   ``I suppose that the fish were probably a little scrappier to
catch but there were so many at that site that the ease of catching
them and the numbers being caught would have made some good
fishing,'' Prescott said.
   The two workers involved in the dumping face a hearing on the
matter.
   The men said that the fish were ``under stress,'' so they
released them, Prescott.

   The Soviet newspaper Izvestia and the Hearst
Corp. plan to test market a weekly paper in both superpower
countries starting on the Fourth of July.
   American and Soviet journalists will work together on the
newspaper to be jointly edited at Hearst's Washington news bureau,
Hearst announced Tuesday.
   Some 25,000 copies of the newspaper, which will be called
WE-Miy, are slated to be distributed to government, business and
education leaders in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Washington and other
U.S. cities.
   Miy, pronounced ``mwee,'' is Russian for ``we.'' In the
newspaper's logo, it will be a Cyrillic character.
   ``Glasnost has opened tremendous opportunities and new
opportunities demand new journalism,'' Vladimir Nadeine, Washington
correspondent for Izvestia said in a statement.
   ``With this issue of WE-Miy, we have started to push glasnost
further and further _ to the plain and simple press freedom we
need.''
   Hearst said the paper will cover political, economic, social
issues and in both countries and will include fashion, sports, arts
and entertainment news.
   ``The Soviet-American interchange has a vitality and tension
derived from the clash of values, power drives, cultural
differences and national interest,'' said WE-Miy editor Jerrold L.
Schecter. ``We intend to explore these differences and similarities
in depth.''
   Izvestia, with a daily circulation of 11 million, is the
newspaper of the Soviet government and the Congress of People's
Deputies.
   Hearst publishes 14 consumer magazines, 12 daily and three
non-daily newspapers and numerous business publications. It also
operates seven radio and six TV stations.

<HEAD>Parliament Debates Abortion Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's Parliament has begun debating an
abortion bill that would allow abortion if a doctor believes the
physical, mental or psychological health of a pregnant woman is
threatened.
   The bill has split Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's governing
party and is opposed by both pro- and anti-abortion lobbies.
   Parliamentarians from all parties have proposed two dozen
amendments, most designed to tighten the restrictions.
   The pro-choice lobby is fighting the law because it says there
have been no restrictions for the past two years and none are
needed now. Anti-abortion forces say the bill doesn't go far enough.
   The bill, on which debate began Tuesday, is aimed at filling the
void left when the Supreme Court struck down a previous law
restricting abortions in January 1988. The court said the old
measure was arbitrary and violated women's rights.
   About 60,000 abortions were performed in Canada last year.
   Mulroney supports the bill but has given his Conservative Party
lawmakers freedom to vote their consciences. The future of the bill
seems to rest on how many of his legislators switch sides and vote
against the government.
   The final vote is scheduled May 29.
   Under the old law, abortions were allowed if they were approved
by a hospital's therapeutic abortion committee, which had to have
at least three doctors. The life and health of the woman were the
only criteria. It was a cumbersome, often agonizingly slow
procedure. There was no single standard, and acceptable reasons for
abortion varied across the country.
   Under the government's proposal, the judgment of a single doctor
would be sufficient to determine that the physical, mental or
psychological health of a pregnant woman is threatened.
   Requiring medical opinion on the need for abortion appears to be
a gesture toward the anti-abortion forces. At the same time, the
Justice Department says the wording of the proposed law is broad
enough to permit abortion on social or economic grounds.
   ``It pretends to be a pro-life bill,'' said Margaret Purcell,
national vice-president for the anti-abortion Campaign Life
Coalition organization.
   ``But under the bill, a woman would only have to walk through
her doctor's door and she has established that she is
psychologically unwell,'' she said.
   The pro-choice Canadian Abortion Rights Action League opposes
the bill for different reasons.
   ``This law will make some abortions criminal,'' said Jane
Holmes, executive coordinator for the lobbying group. ``This is
insulting legislation. This is a primary women's issue.''
   Pro-choice advocates complain the legislation does nothing to
ensure access in provinces like Prince Edward Island, where no
abortions have been performed for eight years because no doctors
are willing to do them.
   The group's president, Kit Holmwood, said she believes
anti-abortion forces will press for charges against any woman who
has an abortion.
   ``They have done it in the (United) States. They are going to
take this law and use it any way they can to stop abortion,'' she
said.
   The measure calls for up to two years in prison for a doctor who
defies the law or a woman who lies about her health. It says all
abortions are criminal unless ``induced by or under the direction
of a medical practitioner who is of the opinion that, if the
abortion were not induced, the health or life of the female person
would be likely to be threatened.''
   The Canadian Medical Association also opposes the measure,
saying the government should keep abortion out of the criminal
code. The association fears anti-abortion forces will harass
doctors by filing criminal charges.

<TEXT>
   Sandinista union demonstrators sang
nostalgic revolutionary songs outside the Supreme Court to protest
newly passed laws that would limit strikes and allow the government
to fire civil servants.
   ``We won't let them destroy the gains of the Sandinista
revolution,'' Jose Angel Bermudez, head of the National Employee's
Union, told the Tuesday night gathering of about 1,200.
   Also Tuesday, a United Nations observer group said 194
anti-Sandinista guerrillas were demobilized and a shipment of U.S.
emergency medical aid arrived by air.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who took office April 25,
had originally enacted the laws by decree but retreated when a
strike virtually shut down the government last week.
   But the laws were then passed by the National Assembly, which
Mrs. Chamorro's coalition party controls.
   The leftist Sandinistas, replaced by Mrs. Chamorro after
controlling the government for nearly 11 years, call the new laws
unconstitutional and plan to appeal to the Supreme Court, which
their judges still dominate.
   ``The people voted for Dona Violeta because she promised to
improve the economy, not to have their rights violated,'' said
Gonzalo Araico, a telephone company worker.
   Mrs. Chamorro's coalition says the government is virtually
bankrupt and the national payroll must be slashed.
   The demonstrators, led by former President Daniel Ortega's
common-law wife Rosario Murillo, joined in revolutionary songs like
``The Wall,'' ``It's Not Enough to Pray'' and ``The People United
Can Never Be Defeated.''
   Murillo, former director of Nicaragua's Institute of Culture,
said musicians and singers were reliving their days of opposition
before the Sandinistas took power in 1979.
   ``Artists didn't play in the street (under the Sandinista
government) because the rules made it too hard,'' Murillo
acknowledged. ``You had to talk to 50 bureaucrats to get permission
to do one performance.''
   The $300,000 in U.S. medical aid, including supplies of
antibiotics and antimalaria pills, arrived in a chartered jet
Tuesday morning.
   The government, embarrassed by the U.S. Congress's delay in
appropriating aid for Nicaragua, trumpeted the arrival as an
expression of U.S. support and said it expected another shipment
next month.
   Fernando Castanon, spokesman for the U.N. observers, said 98
Yatama Indian fighters were demobilized Tuesday. Yatama is an
independent Indian organization that fought alongside the Contra
rebels on the Atlantic Coast.
   The Contra leadership, now based in El Almendro, 110 miles
southeast of Managua, has said it will not order Contra fighters to
disarm because it cannot guarantee their personal security.
   Individual Contras have continued disarming, but at a very slow
pace.
   The Contras claimed 15,000 men under arms as of Sunday, while
the United Nations estimate was about 11,000.
   The 96 regular Contras demobilized Tuesday brought the total
since May 8 to 1,404. At 96 a day, there would still be 9,000 to
13,000 Contra guerrillas under arms when the June 10 deadline for
full demobilization arrives.

   Stormie Jones, the world's longest surviving
heart-liver transplant patient, is out of the hospital, and doctors
hope higher doses of an experimental anti-rejection drug will allow
the 12-year-old to stay out.
   Stormie was discharged from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on
Tuesday after doctors controlled a mild episode of rejection of her
second donor liver.
   She could return to her home in White Settlement, Texas, within
a few days, perhaps in time for her 13th birthday on May 31, said
her mother, Lois ``Suzie'' Purcell. They were staying with friends
Tuesday, she said.
   Stormie returned to Children's Hospital on Sunday after tests
showed high liver enzyme levels _ a possible sign of organ
rejection.
   Doctors raised her dosage of FK-506 to control the rejection
episode. The Japanese drug has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use only at Children's and
Presbyterian-University hospitals.
   Stormie received a historic heart-liver transplant at Children's
in 1984 to control a congenital condition that left her cholesterol
level 10 times higher than normal. She received another liver in
February after hepatitis damaged her first donor liver.
   Until November, Stormie had been taking cyclosporine, an
anti-rejection drug that lowers the body's ability to fight
infection. Researchers say FK-506 is more powerful and causes fewer
side effects.
   Modifications in dosages also will be made for many of the 400
transplant patients currently taking FK-506, said Dr. Robert
Gordon, a surgeon at Children's.

<HEAD>Security Council To Meet In Geneva So Arafat Can Speak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council has decided to meet
in Geneva Friday to hear PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in what was
seen as a compromise to avert a dispute over a U.S. visa for the
Palestinian leader.
   The announcement Tuesday night came after the United States
failed to grant Arafat a visa to address a session in New York.
   The 15-member Security Council, the highest U.N. body, held
several hours of closed consultations on an Arab request for an
immediate meeting addressed by Arafat. The meeting is to discuss
the escalating violence in Israel's occupied territories and the
need to protect Palestinians.
   Two years ago, the United States rejected Arafat's request for a
visa to address the General Assembly and the session was moved to
Geneva.
   This time, however, the United States did not reject or accept
the request. Rather, U.S. officials said Arafat did not personally
make the request.
   Arabs seek to win U.S. support in condemning violence against
Palestinians and thus wanted to avert a confrontation over the
visa. Israel and influential U.S. lawmakers oppose giving Arafat a
visa.
   The United States, a member of the Security Council, did not
oppose a move to Geneva.
   In December 1988, Arafat renounced terrorism and implicitly
recognized Israel's right to exist, prompting the United States to
open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering declined comment when
reporters asked him what the United States had decided on granting
a visa to Arafat.
   On Monday, the 22-nation Arab League requested the urgent
meeting, prompted by the killing of seven Arabs by an apparently
deranged Israeli gunman on Sunday and the subsequent shooting
deaths of 10 Arabs by Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands.
   Arafat last visited the United States in 1974 when he addressed
the General Assembly on Palestine.
   The Security Council has met outside New York only twice: in
January 1972 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to discuss African matters,
and March 1973 in Panama City to discuss the Panama Canal.

   The co-pilot was a dead duck, but the
pilot and passenger lived to tell the story.
   The 3-pound duck landed in the co-pilot's seat after crashing
through the windshield of the single-engine plane.
   ``It happened real fast. I saw a shadow closing in on my
windshield, and then felt a rush of air coming through,'' pilot
Oddvar Sand of L.A.B. Flying Service said Tuesday. ``I had feathers
in my mouth.''
   The duck is in a freezer, he said. ``I'm going to have it
stuffed for the memory.''
   The accident occurred Saturday while Sand was taking a passenger
on the 40-mile flight from Hoonah to Juneau. Sand said he was
climbing to cruising altitude when he ran into a flock of ducks at
about 2,000 feet.
   ``I didn't have a chance to duck,'' he said.
   One bird crashed through the quarter-inch plastic windshield,
bounced off the dash, hit Sand in the chest, and then fell into the
co-pilot's seat, said Lynn Bennett, chief pilot for L.A.B.
   Sand suffered a gash on his head that took six stitches to
close. His passenger was in the back seat of the Piper Cherokee and
was not hurt.
   Sand said the duck ``fluttered his wings a little bit and just
died right there.'' It took him about 10 minutes to reach the
airport after the accident, the wind blowing in his face through
the broken windshield, he said.
   ``I just slowed down the airplane and flew into Juneau,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Abortion Foe Wins GOP Gubernatorial Nomination; Andrus Seeks
Fourth Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB FICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans nominated a former state
lawmaker and abortion opponent to challenge Democratic Gov. Cecil
Andrus, who vetoed what would have been the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law.
   With 92 percent of the votes counted in the GOP primary, former
Senate majority leader Roger Fairchild had 34,446 votes, or 38
percent, to 29,163, or 32 percent, for state Sen. Rachel Gilbert,
another abortion opponent.
   Stockbroker Milton Erhart, who hoped to capitalize on his
support of legalized abortion, finished third with 26,344 votes, or
29 percent.
   Andrus, seeking an unprecedented fourth term, had no primary
opposition.
   In other races, a GOP congressman seeking to succeed retiring
Republican Sen. James McClure won his party's primary. Democrats
picked a Boise businessman to oppose him.
   With 84 percent of the vote in, Rep. Larry Craig had 51,312
votes, or 57 percent, to 38,909, or 43 percent, for Attorney
General Jim Jones in the GOP Senate primary.
   Craig, 44, campaigned on his conservative record over 10 years
in the House, underscored by his drive to pass a constitutional
amendment for a balanced federal budget.
   In the Democratic Senate race, businessman Ron Twilegar had
22,963 votes, or 63 percent, to 13,641, or 37 percent, for
political newcomer David Steed with 85 percent of the vote in.
   Andrus was governor from 1971 to 1977, then served as President
Carter's interior secretary for four years. He regained the
governorship in 1986.
   A longtime opponent of abortion, Andrus angered anti-abortion
forces when he vetoed what would have been the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law a half-hour after the
Republican-dominated Legislature adjourned on March 30.
   The legislation called for outlawing abortion except in cases of
rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18,
severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or physical health
of the woman.
   Fairchild, 37, said during the campaign that he would have
signed the legislation ``in a baby's heartbeat.''
   Abortion-rights advocates targeted lawmakers who backed the
bill. The Right to Life Committee took aim at legislators who
backed legalized abortion.
   The effort created 20 primary races on Tuesday's legislative
ballot that pitted candidates with opposing abortion stands, but
only nine involved incumbents.

<HEAD>Anti-Castro Cuban Leaders to Host Soviet Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an event that would have been almost unthinkable
a year ago, Miami's militantly anti-communist Cuban leaders are
playing host for a weekend of meetings, seminars and parties with
visiting Soviet officials.
   Soviet political advisers, including five members of the Supreme
Soviet, will stop here Saturday and Sunday to talk with community
leaders before attending next week's Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting
in Washington.
   ``The Cold War is really over. It's a new era,'' said Soviet
delegate Andrei Kortunov.
   In the past, Miami has been the site of a militant, sometimes
violent brand of anti-communism. A Polish vessel was hit with a
homemade bazooka in 1968, the city tried to ban Miss Yugoslavia
from an international beauty pageant here, and as recently as last
year, Miami's Calle Ocho street festival barred anyone who had ever
performed in Cuba. Businesses and museums that do business with
Cuba have been bombed.
   But Cuban community leaders, including Mayor Xavier Suarez and
Jorge Mas Canosa, the head of the anti-Castro Cuban American
National Foundation, agree that the world has changed.
   ``The time has come to take risks,'' Mas said. ``We have a great
opportunity to convey to the Soviet people that we Cuban-Americans
are not the enemy.
   The event, called the Moscow in Miami Pre-Summit, gets under way
officially on Saturday. It includes seminars on regional conflicts
and superpower relations, sessions on glasnost and tips on how to
do business in the Soviet Union.
   There is also a lighter side, including a party in cowboy hats
at Regine's nightclub and sightseeing for the Soviets.
   Cuban-American leaders here, heartened by the strained relations
between Mikhail Gorbachev and Fidel Castro, hope to take advantage
of the Soviets' presence to persuade them to stop subsidizing Cuban
communism.
   The Soviets in turn are seeking landing rights for the national
airline Aeroflot in this gateway to Latin America.
   Kortunov said moves toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union
have changed the way people in his country see Miami.
   ``The basic vision of Miami was as a city of racial tension, a
city of Cuban criminals and a place where American millionaires can
come to enjoy life at the beach,'' he said.
   ``Now the image of Miami is changing. We understand that Miami
is the unofficial capital of the Caribbean. We also should change
our attitudes about Cuban immigrants here.''

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four former high school football players
were indicted on charges they sexually assaulted a retarded girl
while nine other young men participated or watched.
   Defense lawyers generally acknowledge what happened in 1989 in
the basement of a house in Glen Ridge, an affluent New York City
suburb of 8,000 people, but say the girl consented.
   But the victim has an IQ of 49 to 64 and cannot consent to
sexual activity, Essex County Prosecutor Herbert H. Tate Jr. said
in announcing Tuesday's indictments.
   Indicted were twins Kevin and Kyle Scherzer, former co-captains
of the Glen Ridge High School football squad, and former teammates
Richard Corcoran Jr., and Peter Quigley. All four are 19 years old.
   They were accused of assaulting the girl with a broomstick and a
miniature baseball bat while some of the nine other teen-agers
present cheered.
   The girl was ``physically helpless, mentally defective or
mentally incapacitated,'' the indictment said.
   The four were charged with aggravated sexual assault, conspiracy
and aggravated sexual contact. Each faces up to 20 years in prison.
   Lawyers for Quigley and Corcoran denied their clients
participated.
   Two friends of the players also were indicted Tuesday.
   Mari Carmen Ferraez, 19, was accused of contacting the victim
and tape-recording her in an attempt to get her to change her
story. She was indicted on witness-tampering and obstruction
charges.
   John Maher was charged with conspiracy for allegedly asking the
victim to return to the scene of the incident the next day.
   Maher faces 10 years in prison if convicted, Ms. Ferraez five.
   Tate said three juveniles arrested in the case and a fourth, who
has not been charged, are named as unindicted co-conspirators in
the indictment.
   Prosecutors have asked that the three juveniles charged be tried
as adults. A judge has not ruled on the request.

<HEAD>School Board Bans e.e. cummings Poem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An e.e. cummings poem that uses
sexual imagery in telling of a man's reaction to a new car was too
explicit for some school board members.
   They voted to ban the textbook in which it is found.
   ``The poem was open to numerous interpretations, one of which
was explicitly sexual,'' Susan Zimmerman of the Grand Rapids Board
of Education said at Monday's meeting.
   The board split 4-4 on whether to ban the book, ``Literature _
An Introduction to Reading and Writing.'' The tie means the
textbook, used in a pilot program last year at City High School,
will not be used permanently.
   Diane Wakoski, writer in residence at Michigan State University
in East Lansing, said the board should appreciate the poem for
expressing passion without being blatantly vulgar.
   ``There are sexual puns in almost every e.e. cummings poem,''
Wakoski said. ``He's a great love poet and everyone's loves usually
include sex.''
   Written in cummings' unconventional style, the poem begins:
   ``she being Brand -new; and you know consequently a little stiff
i was careful of her and (having thoroughly oiled the universal
joint tested my gas felt of her radiator made sure her springs were
O.K.) i went right to it flooded-the-carburetor cranked her up,
slipped the clutch ...''
   Wakoski was dismayed with the board's action.
   ``I thought we had reached the stage in our culture where we
could talk rationally, realistically and sensibly about sex in our
classrooms,'' she said. ``e.e. cummings' use of language is
discreet and practically genteel.''

<HEAD>Funeral Procession For Student Who Died During Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By J.H. YUN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students shouting
anti-government, anti-U.S. slogans marched in this southern city
today behind the coffin of a dead student activist heralded as a
martyr and patriot.
   ``Drive out Yankees,'' students shouted, ``Crush (President) Roh
Tae-woo!''
   Riot police armed with clubs and shields were deployed around
government offices and along major downtown streets to deter
violence. Traffic on streets came to a stop as the procession
passed.
   About 3,000 radical students, many wearing traditional white
Korean mourning clothes, chanted and hummed funeral dirges as they
followed a hearse bearing the body of student activist Shin Jan-ho,
21. Some waved long colorful funeral streamers printed with
anti-government slogans.
   Shin was one of 20,000 students from around the country who came
to Kwangju to participate in protests over the weekend. He died of
massive head injuries Saturday after jumping off a speeding train
to avoid police checkpoints at the train station.
   Radicals claim police are responsible for the death and vowed to
retaliate.
   Violent protests have been staged for a week in Kwangju to mark
the anniversary of a 1980 civil uprising, the bloodiest in modern
Korean history. At least 84 police and 400 students and citizens
have been injured in five-days of protests.
   During today's funeral, six students wearing white clothes and
black headbands carried a giant Korean national flag at the head of
the procession. Others carried a large photograph of the dead
student rimmed in black.
   Hundreds of citizens watched from the sidewalks as the
procession wound along city streets to Chosun and Chonnam
Universities where two funeral rites were held.
   A traditional fortune teller performed a dance for repose of the
soul at Chonnam University. Students frequently interrupted
services with dissident songs and shouted slogans.
   ``The U.S. _ real culprint of the Kwangju massacre _ get out!''
students chanted.
   The student was to be buried as a martyr at a cemetery outside
Kwangju where victims of the 1980 uprising are buried.
   Police officials feared the funeral would spark more violence
and about 7,500 riot police were on alert. Thousands of students
rioted in the city over the weekend, burning tires on the streets
and attacking police with firebombs, rocks and clubs.
   Radicals claim the United States condoned the suppression of the
1980 uprising against a martial law government and anti-American
sentiment is strong in Kwangju. U.S. flags are painted on campus
roadways and banners and posters showing shredded American flags
are common.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,700 others wounded 10 years ago in the 10-day, pro-democracy
revolt in Kwangju, 150 miles south of Seoul. Kwangju citizens claim
the death toll was much higher.
   Also today, a protester shouting anti-Japanese slogans attempted
suicide in front of the Japanese Embassy by stabbing himself in the
abdomen to demand Japan make a clear-cut apology for its colonial
rule over Korea.
   About a dozen riot police guarding the embassy rushed toward him
and snatched the knife, the witnesses said. A police patrol car the
man to a nearby hospital, but the man's condition was not
immediately known.

   An alleged hit man for a drug dealer was
cleared of murder in the firebombing deaths of six people.
   A jury, brought in from St. Louis because of publicity
surrounding the case, deliberated four hours Tuesday before
acquitting 33-year-old James A. Skinner in the 1989 blaze at a
Kansas City home.
   Members of four generations of a family, including three
children and an invalid, were killed in the fire. Seven other
family members, including the drug dealer's target, escaped.
   The dealer, Aaron O. Frazier, testified he paid $150 to Skinner
and two other men to firebomb the house in a feud with a member of
the family. Three of Frazier's friends also testified he hired
Skinner to burn the house.
   Assistant Prosecutor Joseph P. Bednar Jr. said jurors told him
after the trial there were too many inconsistencies in the
witnesses' stories to believe them.
   Frazier and the others differed over whether the bomb was thrown
from Skinner's car and whether the arsonists had walked to the
house.
   Frazier testified as part of a plea bargain to avoid the death
penalty.
   Skinner told police he was home in bed on the night of the fire.
He did not testify.

   Federal agents searched three Northrop Corp.
plants, reportedly looking for defective parts and for records of
alleged overcharging on contracts for the FA-18 fighter jet.
   About 50 FBI agents raided the plants in El Segundo, Hawthorne
and Carson on Tuesday, authorities said.
   ``We are working with them in their search, and that is all that
I can comment upon,'' said Northrop spokesman Ron Owens.
   FBI agent Fred Reagan would not comment on the raids.
   The Los Angeles Times quoted an unidentified federal law
enforcement official as saying the agents were looking for
defective FA-18 parts and records on alleged overcharges.
   Northrop assembles FA-18 fuselage sections in El Segundo. The
Hawthorne plant makes parts for the aircraft, and the Carson plant
is a records storage center.
   The search warrant was issued based on a sealed affidavit with
information developed by the Naval Investigative Service. NIS is
part of a multi-agency task force that is investigating the company.
   The raids follow a series of legal run-ins Northrop has had with
federal agencies.
   In February, Northrop pleaded guilty to falsifying tests on
parts for nuclear-armed cruise missiles and agreed to a $17 million
fine.
   Also in February, federal agents raided Northrop's B-2 stealth
bomber plant in Pico Rivera and confiscated records.
   In April, the Justice Department sued Northrop, accusing the
company of padding FA-18 bills submitted to the Navy. The lawsuit
seeks at least $25 million.

<HEAD>University Sells its Tobacco Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard University has sold the stock it
owned in companies that manufacture tobacco products because of the
dangers of smoking.
   The university decided to sell the stocks last September and
completed the sales in March, according to Harvard President Derek
Bok.
   He revealed the sale May 18 in a letter to three Harvard School
of Public Health students, who had been demanding the university
sell its investments in companies manufacturing cigarettes.
   ``In reaching its decision, the corporation was motivated by a
desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged
in significant sales of products that create a substantial and
unjustified risk of harm to other human beings,'' Bok wrote.
   Dr. Allan Blum, a Houston physician and chairman of Doctors
Ought To Care, a national anti-smoking group that pushes for
divestment of tobacco stocks, called Harvard's decision a
``breakthrough morally and financially.''
   ``This is a historic event that can't help but send a message
that there's something rotten about holding tobacco stocks,'' Blum
said.
   Sara Ridgway, vice president of public affairs for the Lorillard
Tobacco Co., said the decision may deprive Harvard of profitable
stock investments.
   ``I think it would behoove them to look at the best investments,
and our stock has done very well,'' she said.
   Bok said the decision was based on an Advisory Committee on
Shareholder Responsibility review.
   He also said tobacco companies did not adequately answer
questions about ethical issues in selling tobacco and their
adherence to World Health Organization guidelines for marketing
tobacco products in the Third World.

   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said
today his country does not intend to attack Iraq or any other Arab
country, but remains worried about Iraqi policy.
   Peres, who arrived Monday for a meeting of the Socialist
International Council, told a news conference he spoke for all of
Israel.
   But he warned that it would be ``a tragedy'' if an Arab summit
conference set to meet next Monday in Baghdad, Iraq's capital,
adopted a belligerent attitude toward Israel.
   Peres was asked about Arab fears of an Israeli attack on Iraq.
   ``I think I can speak for the whole of Israel,'' he replied.
``Israel does not have any intention of attacking Iraq or any other
country.''
   Peres served as finance minister in the government of right-wing
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir before breaking up the governing
coalition in March in a disagreement over U.S. Middle East peace
proposals. Shamir is now trying to form a government.
   Peres suggested that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will be a
moderating influence at the Arab summit.
   ``President Mubarak is of help to the Middle East, (taking) a
middle road,'' Peres said. ``He remains totally committed to
peace.''
   On Tuesday, Mubarak reiterated to reporters that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein has no intention of attacking Israel. Mubarak added,
however, that Saddam continues to be haunted by memories of
Israel's 1981 air attack that destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor,
and fears a new atack.
   Saddam last month threatened to destroy half of Israel with
binary chemical weapons from his arsenal if Israel mounts a nuclear
attack on Iraq.

   Uncooperative creditors and trouble with
federal wildlife authorities dashed plans by a bankrupt Soviet
circus to stage a series of tour-saving shows.
   The Great Circus Bim Bom ran out of money and had to halt its
U.S. tour on May 9. Now U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials in
New York are threatening to seize 54 circus animals allegedly in
the country illegally.
   Costumes and equipment needed for the Atlanta shows, which had
been tentatively scheduled for next month, will not be released by
a transportation company that is owed money, circus spokesman John
Stallion said Tuesday.
   The combination of dilemmas effectively killed plans to stage
the Atlanta shows, he said.
   Problems brewing over the animals stranded in Newburgh, N.Y.,
were caused by a lack of paperwork, circus managing director Andrew
Trueman said.
   ``I can't believe Fish and Wildlife is going to ship our animals
back just because we don't have a $25 report,'' he said.
   ``The animals are here illegally,'' said Sam Librandi, a
wildlife official in New York City. ``We think they should be sent
back until the problems are solved.''
   The 54 animals, which include bears, lions, horses and
chimpanzees, have been under federal scrutiny since last week, when
a Humane Society official reported they were being kept in cramped
cages meant only for transportation.
   Circus officials in Marietta with the troupe's 125 performers
are trying to find money to resume the tour and said they working
to correct problems surrounding the animals.
   But Librandi said his agency has gotten no cooperation from the
circus.
   Animals brought into the United States from foreign countries
are required to have wildlife declaration documents. Bim Bom's
animals did not have the documents when they arrived in the
country, and circus officials have not provided them since, he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush recently counseled Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to shrug off the heckling he got at a May Day parade,
suggesting the Soviet leader ``ought to come join some of the
parades I go to.''
   But actually Bush has had it easy. Signs waved in his face are
just as likely to make whimsical comments about broccoli these days
as denounce U.S. policy in Central America.
   And some hecklers have gone so far as to buy tickets to gain
legal admission to Republican fund-raisers _ a form of protest that
activists of the 1960s and 70s would never have dreamed of doing.
   As he crisscrosses the country giving speeches and raising funds
for Republican candidates, Bush is seldom confronted with the angry
crowds that dogged and sometimes drowned out other presidents.
   It may be a sign of the times, but protesters don't seem very
angry these days.
   Last Sunday, Bush was on his way to a speech in Portland, Ore.,
when a passenger train drew abreast of his motorcade on tracks that
paralleled the highway. Two passengers, a man and a woman,
recognized the president and both began making obscene gestures at
him from the train window.
   This went on for several minutes as the train and motorcade kept
precise pace. Bush looked at the couple and nodded politely.
Finally, the two stopped gesturing and both began waving at the
president. ``Hello Mr. President,'' the words formed by the woman
said.
   A crowd of 150 to 200 demonstrators burned flags and newspapers
the next day outside the hotel in downtown Portland where Bush was
speaking.
   There were a few arrests of those starting the fires. But for
the most part, the crowd broke up peacefully when police moved in.
   The signs carried by the protesters covered a range of subjects.
Some protested Bush's environmental record. Others dealt with AIDS,
the homeless, U.S. support for El Salvador. One targeted
administration tax policy: ``If his lips are moving, he's lying.''
   And that was one of the biggest demonstrations Bush had seen in
months.
   With the mixture of messages, protesters don't seem to be very
organized.
   At an event earlier this week in Los Angeles, where Bush gave a
neighborhood speech praising community anti-drug efforts, one
heckler within easy earshot of Bush screamed: ``Contras. Cocaine.
El Salvador. It's all your fault.''
   Bush looked at him quizzically. ``Oliver North. The CIA. The
homeless,'' the man shouted, repeating the same words over and over
again.
   Bush shrugged. Others in the crowd told the man to keep quiet.
   At two fund-raisers this year, hecklers who interrupted Bush's
speeches turned out to have purchased tickets to get in _ at
several hundred dollars apiece.
   More often than not, demonstrators at Bush's speeches complain
for a few minutes, then sit down and keep quiet.
   Protesters who show up at Bush events most frequently complain
about U.S. support for El Salvador, Bush's anti-abortion stance and
his position on feminist issues. There also usually are several
signs calling attention to environmental issues or lamenting levels
of spending on AIDS research and for the homeless.
   But there also are more and more broccoli signs.
   Ever since Bush declared war on broccoli, there have been a
myriad of broccoli signs at Bush events, some of them nasty, most
of them good-natured. One proclaimed ``Bush Beats Broccoli'' and
bore a cartoon of Bush in boxing trunks, standing victoriously over
a fallen broccoli stalk.
   Restaurants sometimes bear signs with variations on this theme:
``We don't serve broccoli, come on in Mr. President.''
   Bush's tendency to meet with various interest groups may help
mute some of the criticism _ even though it may also spawn it in
some unexpected areas.
   The president's decision to include several gay rights activists
at a White House ceremony to sign legislation to crack down on
so-called ``hate crimes'' won him plaudits from gay organizations.
   But partly as a result of those invitations, Southern Baptists
withdrew an invitation to Bush to speak at their convention this
June in New Orleans.

   A man shouting ``Apologize, Akihito!''
stabbed himself in front of the Japanese Embassy today in a protest
demanding that Japan's emperor apologize for Japan's colonial rule
over Korea.
   The attack came on the eve of President Roh Tae-woo's state
visit to Japan, which is aimed at increasing economic and other
ties between the two countries.
   The man pulled a knife from his jacket, knelt down on the street
about 10 feet from the embassy gate and stabbed himself in the
abdomen, police said.
   About a dozen riot police guarding the embassy rushed toward him
and snatched the knife, witnesses said. A police patrol car rushed
the man to a nearby hospital.
   He was identified as Kim Kuk-bin, 33, a videotape dealer from
Seoul. He told a news conference later at Hankook Hospital he could
not endure what he called Japan's ``lukewarm'' attitude in
apologizing for its actions.
   His exact condition was not known. In Korea and Japan, ritual
suicide called harakiri has been a traditional form of protest.
   Police also detained about 50 other protesters who staged a
separate demonstration outside the embassy today.
   Four busloads of police guarded the embassy after the attack and
the arrest of the protesters. It was not known whether the
protesters were released.
   For more than a week, bands of 30 to 40 mostly elderly Koreans
have been staging protests at the embassy, demanding Akihito
apologize for Japan's colonial rule of Korea. They want the apology
to be made during Roh's three-day visit to Japan, which begins
Thursday.
   ``I cannot bear the president's visit to Japan with the legacy
of Japan's imperial colonial rule remaining unliquidated here,''
Kim said. He said his father was a guerrilla fighter during Japan's
colonial rule.
   The protesters also demanded Japan compensate for actions during
its 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea, during which hundreds of
thousands of Koreans were forced to work as slave laborers. The
protesters contend that the Japanese killed thousands of Koreans
during the war.
   Roh has been under public pressure to cancel his trip.
Dissidents contend Roh's trip to Japan will deepen South Korea's
economic dependence on Japan.
   Japan and South Korea also have been locked in a diplomatic war
over better treatment of about 600,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan.
Seoul has asked Tokyo to eliminate discrimination against Koreans
in Japan who were forced to live there after being drafted for
forced labor.

<HEAD>Fired Editor Sues Wall Street Journal for Libel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Wall Street Journal editor is suing the
financial daily for $12.6 million, claiming he was wrongly fired
and libeled by a false charge of plagiarism.
   Jonathan Kandell, 43, who was fired as assistant foreign editor
of the Journal on May 2, filed the lawsuit Tuesday.
   The Journal accused Kandell of lifting uncredited material from
another writer's book for a page 1 article about three
entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Journal owner Dow Jones &amp; Co., said,
``Dow Jones believes the suit is utterly without merit and the
company intends to defend itself vigorously.''
   Kandell's article on March 30 profiled a Soviet machine tool
maker, a Czechoslovak inventor and a Hungarian banker as
individuals succeeding in the private sector.
   Kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three in
their countries after hearing them speak at a November meeting in
New York sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations.
   He said that at the same meeting he learned of the book
``Communist Entrepreneurs'' and met its author, John W. Kiser III.
He said he later ``read the book once and put it aside.''
   Kandell's suit said he told his editors that he hadn't credited
Kiser's book in his article because he had ``done all his own
legwork and the book was not where he had first learned of the
subject.''
   On May 1, Kandell said, the editors told him they had decided he
should have mentioned Kiser's book in the article, ``but emphasized
that it was a judgment call.''
   Later that same day, Kandell said, he learned he was to be
fired. He quoted Paul Steiger, a deputy managing editor, as saying
he had a gut feeling that Kandell had not been truthful and that he
had shown a ``lack of candor.''
   Kandell said he was dismissed the next day after consulting with
his lawyer and refusing to sign a letter of resignation that he
said would have kept him on the Journal's payroll through June 30.
   In his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
Kandell contends he was libeled and his professional reputation
destroyed by the Journal. He demanded $10 million in punitive
damages and $2.64 million in compensation for ``willful, wanton and
reckless disregard of the truth'' and ``actual malice'' on the
paper's part.
   He said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the
newspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the same
subject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper The
Village Voice about Kandell's case. The Village Voice was not named
as a defendant in the suit.
   Kandell's suit also demanded the return of original notes and
other documents that he contended the paper's editors had kept,
knowing they would support his position.

<HEAD>`Gonzo' Writer Ordered To Stand Trial on Felony Drug, Explosives
Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Journalist-author Hunter S. Thompson was
ordered to stand trial on four felony drug and explosives charges.
   The father of so-called ``gonzo'' journalism sprinkled the
preliminary hearing Tuesday with low-key outbursts before District
Judge Charles Buss ruled there was sufficient evidence to proceed
with a trial.
   The judge dismissed one felony count of drug use because
Thompson's primary accuser could not verify a substance she
testified the writer sniffed was a narcotic.
   Thompson, 53, was fidgety during the hearing and at times was
heard muttering, ``That's bull'' or ``Ah, come on,'' particularly
during the testimony of Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, of Port Huron, Mich.
   Sexual assault allegations by Ms. Palmer-Slater, a former
X-rated film producer, prompted a two-day search of his secluded
mountain home in February that led to the drug and explosives
charges.
   Three separate misdemeanor charges stemming from the alleged
sexual assault were not considered at Tuesday's hearing. The felony
trial was scheduled for June 25.
   At the noon break Thompson left the courthouse followed by
photographers and reporters and at one point stopped to pose.
   ``Let me do a Nixon,'' he said, stopping to raise his arms and
flash a V-for-victory signal with both hands.
   The columnist and writer of such books as ``Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas,'' has said he never assaulted the woman, who he says was
drunk and pressured him to have sex.
   Defense attorney Hal Haddon argued Pitkin County prosecutors
cannot prove that Thompson owned the drugs and explosives found at
his home in rural Woody Creek. Thompson has said that the search
was so extensive it may have turned up drugs left by party guests
years earlier.
   Found at the house were a small amount of cocaine, more than one
ounce of marijuana, tablets of LSD and the tranquilizer diazepam,
four sticks of dynamite and three blasting caps, authorities said.
   Haddon said the explosives were owned by a friend of Thompson's
who used them to dislodge beaver dams.
   Supporters of the writer who inspired the character Duke in the
``Doonesbury'' comic strip demonstrated outside the courthouse,
waving signs like, ``When the going gets weird, the weird go to
jail,'' and, ``Today the doctor, tomorrow you.''
   Thompson's books are written in a style dubbed ``gonzo''
journalism because their seemingly non-fictional narratives of news
events often include exaggerated accounts of his antics brought on
by drug and alcohol abuse.

<HEAD>Thai Leader Says Cambodian Factions Soon To Sign Truce</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Sihanouk comment, background. No

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four warring factions in Cambodia
have agreed to sign a cease-fire pact soon, Thailand's prime
minister was quoted as saying today.
   Official Radio Thailand said the Thai leader, Chatichai
Choonhavan, a key mediator in the conflict, mentioned a possible
truce while speaking about talks on the Cambodian conflict to be
held in Tokyo June 4-5.
   If a pact is signed, it would be the first significant agreement
reached in 11 years of conflict. In the past, however, all sides to
the conflict have gone back on promises of agreements.
   ``It is certain that the four Cambodian factions have agreed to
sign a cease-fire agreement soon,'' the broadcast paraphrased
Chatichai as saying.
   It said Chatichai briefed reporters after conferring in Bangkok
on Tuesday with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam, which
backs the Phnom Penh government in its battle against the three
guerrilla groups.
   Officials have said the talks are likely to focus on questions
of how to monitor a cease-fire and conduct free elections, as well
as the role of the United Nations in the process.
   Negotiations thus far have been stymied by quarrels over who
should govern Cambodia before the election. Various officials have
said a truce should be reached without waiting for resolution of
the political disagreements.
   Communist Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia has said he will
attend the Tokyo talks. A Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted
Thach as saying he hoped Hun Sen would be flexible at the talks.
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the main non-Communist guerrilla
leader, said in a statement issued in Bangkok today that Thailand's
army Chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the main broker of the
proposed truce, persuaded him to attend.
   Sihanouk referred vaguely to ``the Cambodian peace agreement ...
which possibly I would sign in Tokyo.'' But he said the agreement
would commit only himself since he recently resigned as head of the
guerrilla coalition.
   Son Sann, leader of one of the guerrilla groups, the
non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, also will
be in Tokyo at the time of the talks, his office said.
   It was not certain if the third guerrilla group, the Communist
Khmer Rouge, would participate. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late
1978, ending nearly four years of bloody Khmer Rouge rule, then
installed Hun Sen.
   Hun Sen, Sihanouk and Son Sann have spoken in favor of a truce,
but the Khmer Rouge, which has the largest guerrilla army,
previously said it wanted a cease-fire only in the context of an
overall political settlement.
   The Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman, Somphong Faichampa, said
hopes for a settlement have risen because Vietnam and China, which
arms the guerrillas, soon will hold another round of talks on
Cambodia.
   The United Nations Security Council also will meet soon to
discuss its role in the peace process, he said.

   Police today called on citizens to
identify organizers of a planned demonstration to protest alleged
vote fraud in the national elections won by the National Salvation
Front.
   A handful of protesters gave passers-by leaflets in Bucharest's
downtown University Square today, urging Romanians to join the
protest march Thursday.
   Police said they questioned several of those handing out
leaflets but none were arrested. Police said they suspected the
leaflets were trying to incite the public but that those
distributing the handbills had not committed a crime.
   A police statement in the pro-government daily Adevarul urged
citizens to identify ``ill-meaning elements'' giving out the
leaflets. It did not elaborate.
   The leaflets claimed results from Romania's first democratic
election in 50 years were rigged by the Front, a loose grouping of
former Communists and technocrats that has dominated politics since
a revolution in December toppled hard-line Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu and the Front are likely to become
the first ex-Communists in Eastern Europe to triumph in multiparty
elections.
   ``The votes were manipulated'' and even those who died in the
revolution ``were registered and `voted,''' said Elena Vasile, 30,
who was among those handing out leaflets.
   Foreign election observers said there were many irregularities
in the balloting, but not enough to affect the outcome.
   Officials said 16 million Romanians were eligible to vote and
that at least 85 percent of them participated.
   With 14 million votes counted, Iliescu captured 85.30 percent of
the three-way presidential race. His main contender, Radu Campeanu
of the National Liberal Party, had 10.6 percent, and Ion Ratiu of
the National Peasant Party had 4.1 percent. The Front took about
two-thirds of the vote for the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.
   Iliescu, 60, a former Communist party secretary who says he
wants to turn Romania into a Swedish-style social democracy, went
on record as saying he would seek a coalition with the opposition.
   But his two opponents, who said they will seek to nullify the
election on grounds of fraud, indicated it was unlikely they would
join.

<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins asked a city torn by racial
strife to come together to fight the common foes of crime, poverty
and prejudice.
   The city's first black mayor made his plea Tuesday before 6,000
New Yorkers at a city-sponsored rally on the edge of Harlem.
   ``When a few shout out words of hate, we can drown them out with
acts of hope,'' Dinkins said.
   ``And when the instigators seek to turn us against each other,
we can respond by turning to each other _ and coming together to
fight our common foes: crack and crime, poverty, prejudice and
pollution.''
   The most recent irritant to race relations was a pair of
verdicts in the Bensonhurst case, the slaying of a black teen-ager
by a mob of whites in the mostly white section of Brooklyn in
August. One white teen-ager was convicted of murder; a co-defendant
was acquitted of murder but convicted of lesser charges.
   A black boycott of a Korean-American grocery store and a speech
by a City University professor who espouses white supremacy also
have heightened tensions.
   Dinkins, in announcing the city-sponsored Unity Rally on Monday,
said ``a silent majority'' needed to be heard above the voices of
some activists who have been fueling instead of soothing tensions.
   Dinkins was joined Tuesday night at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine by Gov. Mario Cuomo and Cardinal John O'Connor of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese.
   ``For God's sakes, why are we fighting among ourselves?'' Cuomo
asked the crowd. ``We must save our strength for the real battles _
for fighting the closed-minded, the skinheads, the anti-Semites,
the racists and gay haters.''
   The speeches, interrupted by standing ovations and cheers, were
broadcast live on local television.
   About a dozen blacks picketed the cathedral, holding signs that
read: ``Let's take our peace, justice and unity rally to
Bensonhurst.''
   The rally was followed by a candle-lighting ceremony and
singing, led by the mayor.
   ``We are witnessing the children of the immigrants and the
oppressed fighting each other as never before,'' he told the crowd.
``The powerless are trying to prove their power by hurting those
who are just as powerless. It must stop _ and it must stop now.''

   Communist rebels firing from a van
ambushed a high-ranking security official on one of Manila's
busiest streets today, killing him and four other people and
injuring nine.
   Later today, about 50 members and supporters of the Communist
urban guerrilla unit blamed for the attack _ The Alex Boncayao
Brigade _ rallied briefly in the center of the capital to mark the
group's sixth anniversary.
   Police believe the brigade, the Manila wing of the Communist New
People's Army, is responsible for killing about 60 soldiers, police
and civilians in the capital this year.
   President Corazon Aquino called the killing ``brutal and
senseless'' and ordered ``swift justice'' for the killers.
   Also today, the Cabinet decided to ask Congress to extend the
president's emergency powers by six months. The additional powers
were granted after December's bloody coup attempt.
   Five people, including Col. Reynaldo Dino, were killed in the
ambush on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, one of the city's busiest
thoroughfares. Police said the six assailants, led by a woman,
pulled alongside a car carrying Dino and fired at about 7:30 a.m.
   Dino's car careened into a bus. Then the woman and two male
companions jumped from their van and continued firing, police said.
Witnesses said the woman spat in contempt after she stopped firing.
   Dino, a deputy personnel chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
died later in a hospital. Also slain were Dino's 23-year-old
daughter, Lolita Halili, two bodyguards and a female bystander.
   Most of the nine injured were on the bus, which was hit with
stray bullets.
   The assailants escaped.
   Police Col. Victor Tiangco, operations chief of the Capital
Command, blamed the killing on Communist rebels. Tiangco said Dino
had received death threats from the insurgents and one suspected
guerrilla was arrested last month near his home.
   The ambush was the latest sign of deteriorating security in this
turbulent capital. On Tuesday, police defused powerful bombs
outside two banks. Officials said the explosives, timed to explode
during the morning rush hour, could have destroyed both buildings.
   Following the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, Congress granted Mrs.
Aquino emergency powers under a decree that expires June 8.
Presidential legal adviser Adolfo Azcuna told reporters the Cabinet
decided to ask Congress for a six-month extension of some of the
powers.
   He said they include tougher controls on firearms, the authority
to take over public utilities and the right to regulate
distribution and use of fuel and electricity.

   Israeli troops today enforced curfews in the
occupied lands, confining 1.5 million people to their homes, and
Palestinians observed a general strike to protest the killing of
seven Arabs by an Israeli civilian.
   Hundreds of police reinforcements poured into Jerusalem to
prevent unrest as Israel marked the 23rd anniversary of the capture
of the Old City and surrounding Arab east Jerusalem from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Two Jewish extremists came under a hail of stones while
attempting to pray at the disputed Temple Mount, as thousands
marched through Arab east Jerusalem demonstrating Israel's claim to
the area. They were not injured.
   Two Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing incidents, Arab
reports said today.
   Also today, the Israeli government sharply rejected U.S. and
European criticism that the violence resulted because Middle East
peace talks have been stalled. The Foreign Ministry even implied
that world leaders were encouraging Arab violence by connecting the
unrest to political developments.
   ``Linking the violence to the peace process is liable to be seen
by certain groups as a reason to continue the violence in hope of
attaining their ends,'' ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud said in a
prepared statement.
   On Tuesday, Palestinians in the occupied territories and in
neighboring Jordan took to the streets in escalating protests over
Sunday's massacre of the seven Arab laborers.
   Five people, two in Israel and three in Jordan, were reported
killed and at least 47 injured on Tuesday, the third straight day
of violence following Sunday's shootings. The third death in Jordan
_ a Palestinian accidentally shot by another _ was reported by
hospital officials, but government officials have not confirmed it.
   In Moslem areas of Lebanon today, a general strike to protest
the slayings brought commercial life to a standstill. Palestinians
also observed the third day of a general strike in the occupied
territories.
   In Jordan, relatives quietly buried a 14-year-old Palestinian
boy shot by police Tuesday during a protest in the Irbid refugee
camp near Amman.
   All shops, businesses and schools ended a general strike in
Jordan and Israel, but a week of mourning continued over this
week's deaths. ``Black flags were flown on every corner in the
streets of the camp,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   A similar scene was reported at the seven other major refugee
camps in Jordan.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza, soldiers enforced widespread
curfews for a fourth day in an effort to curb the violence set off
by Sunday's massacre.
   In clashes Tuesday, Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and
wounded 22, raising the toll since Sunday's shootings to 13
Palestinians slain and more than 800 injured.
   The deaths brought to 708 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the Palestinian uprising. At least 216 other
Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have been slain in
the revolt.
   In Jordan, at least two people were killed and 25 wounded
Tuesday as police fired to disperse demonstrations in two cities
and the Baqaa refugee camp near Amman, the capital, the official
Petra news agency said.
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran pledged to take ``all necessary
measures to guarantee safety and order.''
   Nearly half of Jordan's 3.1 million people are Palestinians who
fled Israel in the 1948 or 1967 Middle East wars.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir defended his government
against criticism by Arabs and the U.S. State Department _ both
over Sunday's slayings and the heavy use of gunfire by Israeli
troops during protests.
   ``Anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of
Israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and
viciously distorting the picture,'' Shamir told legislators from
his right-wing Likud bloc.
   Palestinians charge that Israel's harsh tactics in handling the
29-month-old Palestinian uprising and the government's failure to
begin peace talks have increased anti-Arab sentiment.
   ``There is no doubt that the Israeli government led by Shamir
... leads to such catastrophe,'' said pro-PLO leader Faisal
Husseini. ``The atmosphere created by such a government is
responsible.''
   Israeli authorities say the man charged in Sunday's seven
killings in a Tel Aviv suburb, 21-year-old Ami Popper, was deranged
and also upset by an unhappy love affair. A judge ordered
psychiatric evaluation for him on Monday.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said today Popper ``had nothing to
do with who is the prime minister, the composition of the
government or the policies of Israel's government of Israel.''
   ``The man simply went berserk,'' said Arens, a member of
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   President Bush extended personal condolences to the families of
the seven slain Palestinians and those killed later by security
forces. He urged Israel ``to act with maximum restraint.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
complained about the number of casualties caused by the Israeli
army, and spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United States
believes ``that absence of a peace process contributes to violence
in the Middle East.''
   Shamir has headed a caretaker government since its coalition
with the center-left Labor Party collapsed March 15 over Labor's
insistence on negotiating with the Palestinans.
   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council said
it will meet Friday in Geneva to hear PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
discuss violence in Israel because the U.S. government has not
granted him a visa to speak in New York. The U.S. government has
neither accepted nor rejected Arafat's visa request, saying it was
not made by Arafat personally.

<HEAD>Official Indicates Japan Won't Allow Entry of Democracy Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will block the Goddess of Democracy radio
ship from entering its ports if the vessel will be used to make
unauthorized broadcasts to China from international waters, the
chief Cabinet secretary said today.
   It was the latest setback for project organizers, who hope to
beam pro-democracy messages to China before the June 4 anniversary
of the Chinese crackdown on protesters in Beijing. They want to
load a transmitter in Japan.
   ``If we give tacit approval to such behavior, we would be
inviting international criticism,'' Misoji Sakamoto told Japanese
reporters, according to an official of Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu's office who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Officials said the Japanese government has not yet received an
entry request from the crew of the 1,200-ton ship, sponsored by the
French magazine Actuel and other publishing organizations.
   Sakamoto said the unauthorized broadcasts would be illegal. If
the crew asks to enter Japanese ports, the government will handle
the matter ``strictly according to Japanese regulations,'' he said.
   Japan is a signatory of the International Telecommunications
Union, an agreement that prohibits the establishment or use of
broadcast stations on objects on the sea or in the air, even
outside a nation's territorial waters.
   The ship left France on March 17 and last week reached Keelung
in northern Taiwan to take on supplies, including a radio
transmitter sent from France. But customs officials refused to
release the equipment on grounds that the unauthorized radio
broadcasts violate international agreements.
   Earlier, Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in
1997, denied entry to the ship.
   China reportedly has pressured Taiwan not to extend any
assistance to the vessel and asked Japan not to allow the ship to
land.
   The ship was reported preparing to leave Keelung tonight for
Japan.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Nichiei Marine Service Co., a
Japanese shipping agent, received a telex today from Paris saying
the ship would enter Tokyo, Kobe, Nagasaki or Naha in Japan to
obtain equipment and replace crew members.
   Officials of Nichiei Marine could not be reached immediately for
comment.
   The ship's organizers have said they hoped to begin broadcasting
to China before the June 4 anniversary of China's crackdown last
year on the pro-democracy movement in which hundreds and perhaps
thousand died.
   The ship is named after a statue built by students in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square that was destroyed by Chinese tanks during the
repression.

<HEAD>Noted Nuclear Weapons Scientist Switching Jobs After Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist who resigned from a
high-ranking position in nuclear weapons design to protest the
government's ``Star Wars'' research has taken a new job at the Los
Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico.
   Roy D. Woodruff had been in charge of the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory's nuclear weapons design work and had stepped
down to take a lower-ranking job at the research center.
   The 49-year-old scientist announced Tuesday that he will join
Livermore's counterpart in Los Alamos, the birthplace of the atom
bomb, after a three-month vacation.
   John Nuckolls, director of the Livermore lab, issued a statement
saying he was ``pleased that Roy has been able to work out a
suitable arrangement with Los Alamos.''
   In 1985, Woodruff was involved in a dispute with Dr. Edward
Teller, the designer of the hydrogen bomb, and a Teller protege,
Lowell Wood, over research into the Star Wars system, known
officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   He accused the two of making ``wildly optimistic assessments''
of a controversial anti-missile X-ray laser weapon.
   Woodruff found support for his position among many scientists,
including Dr. Sidney Drell of Stanford University and a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist, Dr. Hans Bethe of Cornell University.
   But Woodruff complained that former Livermore director Roger
Batzel wouldn't allow him to give his own assessment of the X-ray
laser to high Reagan administration officials, including the late
CIA director William Casey, as Teller and Wood had done. He
resigned his weapons post in protest.
   After being given a much lower position, Woodruff filed a
grievance with the University of California, which manages the lab
for the U.S. Department of Energy. UC agreed to his demand for a
more responsible position and appointed him assistant associate
director for treaty verification.
   Meanwhile, Congress began an investigation into his allegations
about the X-ray laser and what role, if any, UC and the lab played
in muzzling Woodruff.
   Woodruff received the 1988 Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award
for his ``willingness to jeopardize his career in order to go
public with a realistic assessment of the state of the Strategic
Defense Initiative program.''
   Colleagues said Woodruff has been unhappy over his treatment by
the lab and UC, which he felt should have taken a stronger stand in
his defense.

<HEAD>Six Mutilated Bodies Found in Monrovia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with more killings, reax, background.

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mutilated bodies of six
soldiers, one of them decapitated, were dumped today in the
Liberian capital. A diplomat said the killings were tribal slayings
related to a rebel onslaught.
   A day earlier, four decapitated bodies were found in Monrovia,
causing panic among residents who fear a rebel attack, the ELWA
Christian missionary radio station reported. The identities of the
men were not immediately known.
   ``There are rumors of a lot more such killings going on and
fears that this is just the beginning,'' a diplomat said from
Monrovia on condition of anonymity.
   The bodies found today were dumped around the city. One had been
decapitated and the other victims had been ``hacked to death,'' he
said.
   All were soldiers from the Gio and Mano tribes, to which many
rebels belong, the diplomat said.
   International human rights organizations have accused the troops
of Liberia's president, Samuel Doe, of massacring hundreds of Gio
and Mano civilians in its battle against insurgents.
   The rebels, led by Charles Taylor, have been accused of killing
civilians of the Mandingo and Krahn tribes, to which Doe and many
of his officers belong.
   The rebel National Patriotic Front invaded Liberia from
neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 in a bid to overthrow the
government. Doe's troops have been unable to halt the advance, and
the rebels attacked the south Atlantic port of Buchanan on Sunday.
   The diplomat said there might be ``a few pockets of soldiers
still resisting in Buchanan. But there is no doubt the city is in
rebel hands.''
   It was considered a major victory for the rebels.
   Buchanan is 50 miles from Liberia's main international airport
and 90 miles from the capital. It is the country's main port and
exit point for iron ore, which earned more than 70 percent of the
country's foreign currency. The mine itself, in northern Nimba
County, was captured by rebels last week.
   Taylor has said he is fighting to overthrow Doe and the corrupt
government that has ruined this West African nation, founded by
freed American slaves in 1847. Doe seized power in a bloody 1980
coup that ousted descendants of slaves who discriminated against
indigenous groups.

<HEAD>Police Raid Black Township at Night</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A thousand policemen conducted
house-to-house searches before dawn today in the black township of
Thabong, then drove a convoy through a neighboring white town to
reassure its residents.
   Twelve people have died this week in clashes with police and in
mob attacks in Thabong in the Orange Free State province.
   Police said they arrested 39 people and confiscated knives,
homemade weapons, marijuana and stolen property in their raid at 2
a.m.
   After 9 a.m., police said, a convoy of armored cars and police
vans drove through the white areas of nearby Welkom to allay white
fears and demonstrate the presence of security forces.
   Welkom and Thabong have been the scene of several weeks of
racial tensions. Blacks in Thabong started a boycott of white
businesses to protest harassment by white vigilante patrols. White
vigilantes threatened to blockade the township and cut off all
supplies.
   Last week, two white men were killed in a clash between black
mineworkers and security officials. On Sunday, police fired on
crowds of blacks trying to march from Thabong into white Welkom,
killing 11 people, according to police.
   A former black mayor was stoned, stabbed and burned to death by
a mob in the township on Monday night, and his business and home
were burned. Albert Phakathi was the local leader of Inkatha, a
Zulu-based political organization that rivals the African National
Congress.
   More than 90 people have been injured by police and by crowds of
youths enforcing the boycott or attacking black officials they
consider to be government collaborators. Homes, businesses and
vehicles in the township have been burned.
   But the streets were cleaned by youth organizations Tuesday. And
a community group canceled its boycott of white businesses today,
saying, ``It has created loss and sadness to many people.''
   Col. Hennie Heymans, the police commissioner for Welkom, said
the raid on Thabong homes was a crime prevention exercise and had
been a ``total success.'' He declared the township was now
``cleaned up and stable.'' He said no complaints were received from
the inhabitants, and pamphlets were distributed urging them not to
be intimidated by radicals.
   But local news organizations quoted residents as saying police
banged on their doors, shouted at them and threatened them as they
slept.
   ANC-affiliated activists under the umbrella name, Mass
Democratic Movement, issued a statement condemning the raid and
urging police to stop ``indiscriminate shooting, beating,
tear-gassing and killing of our people.
   ``We also condemn the general harassment of our people under the
guise of crime prevention,'' the group said. It also condemned
``the looting and burning of private and business properties
(which) do not advance our struggle.''
   Police said in their daily unrest report that four blacks had
been killed in the 24 hours ending this morning.
   Three were burned to death by groups of black men in townships
in Natal province, where more than 5,000 people have died in five
years of fighting between Inkatha and ANC supporters.
   The fourth death was caused by a policeman defending himself
from a group of black men who fired several shots at him, police
said.

   Mary Victor Bruce, a pioneer race car driver,
speed boat pilot and aviator once arrested for flying circles
around the Empire State Building, has died, her son said today. She
was 94.
   She died Monday ``of old age,'' said her son and only survivor,
Anthony Bruce.
   She was born Mildred Mary Petre on Nov. 10, 1895, to English
nobleman Lawrence Petre, the squire of Coptfold Hall, and his wife,
a Broadway actress. Her great-grandmother was a California gold
miner.
   Within months of taking up flying, Mrs. Bruce went around the
world solo in her airplane, ``Bluebird.'' The 1930 trip included a
crash on takeoff in Baltimore and Mrs. Bruce's arrest in New York
for her stunt flying.
   ``She was flying such tight circles around the building that the
typists inside said they could see the color of her eyes (blue),''
her son told The Associated Press.
   He said she was quickly released after the arrest and celebrated
by New Yorkers for her daredevilry.
   Later in the same decade, Mrs. Bruce performed dives from 2,000
feet to 50 feet for a flying circus.
   She founded and owned an air ferry service that flew British
newspapers and executives across the English Channel to Paris in
time for breakfast. The airline was the first to use stewardesses,
substituting young women for the traditionally male stewards.
   In race car driving, Mrs. Bruce won the 1927 Ladies Cup at Monte
Carlo and set 117 world records for motoring, including traveling
the farthest north into Lapland by motor car.
   Mrs. Bruce, who never wore slacks but frequently pearls, also
set records on water. She once set the speed record for crossing
the English Channel from Dover to Calais by speed boat and the
24-hour record for distance covered at sea _ 674 miles _ set in
1929.
   She married Victor Austin Bruce in 1929. They were divorced in
1941.
   At the age of 81, she made a comeback after 37 years out of the
air and flew a loop the loop on a two-seater plane.

   A judge ruled against a woman who sued a
newspaper in an effort to prohibit it from printing news of her
divorce.
   ``The state of Rhode Island ... has expressly made that
information a matter of public record,'' Superior Court Judge
Richard J. Israel wrote in the decision.
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman using the name Jane
Doe. She was delaying her final divorce decree in hopes it would
not be printed in The Newport Daily News. The newspaper reported
the judge's decision Tuesday.
   A second woman, calling herself Allison Roe, was allowed to join
the suit earlier this month. The woman claimed that she received
obscene phone calls the day her divorce notice appeared in the
paper.
   Thomas W. Kelly, the attorney for the two women, argued that
printing divorce records of private persons violated the state
Privacy Act.
   But Joseph V. Cavanagh Jr., the paper's lawyer, argued that
divorces are considered public information. He said the U.S.
Supreme Court had ruled in favor of newspapers that printed court
information.
   Cavanagh also argued any ban would violate the First Amendment
to the Constitution.
   Israel did not rule on the constitutional issue but rejected
Kelly's privacy argument.
   ``It was a mistake for Jane Doe or any other person to seek a
court order telling The Daily News not to publish the news about
divorces or other matters in court,'' said David B. Offer, editor
of the paper.

   Antonin Kapek, a former Politburo
member and Communist Party boss of Prague, was found hanged at his
daughter's cottage and apparently committed suicide, the state news
agency said today. He was 68.
   Kapek had tried to commit suicide in January, and was
hospitalized after being found shot in the head near an isolated
country house in Bohemia.
   Kapek supported the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968. The Warsaw Pact
nations that participated in the invasion have now officially
declared it a mistake.
   On Tuesday, Kapek was found hanged in his daughter's country
cottage in west Bohemia, according to the CTK news agency.
   ``No other person's responsibility was found,'' the agency said.
   Viliam Salgovic, a former member of the Slovak Politburo, also
committed suicide earlier this year, following the peaceful
revolution that ousted the Communists from power.
   Miroslav Stepan, Kapek's successor as Prague Communist Party
chief, is currently in custody. He will stand trial on charges of
abuse of power and faces a jail term of up to 10 years.

   The state's anti-Medfly air force is
homeless.
   Forced from its base in suburban El Monte by noise complaints,
agricultural officials wanted to move the squadron of
pesticide-spraying helicopters to Fullerton Municipal Airport. City
officials went to court to block the move.
   Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk on
Tuesday denied the state's request for a temporary restraining
order that would have forced Fullerton city officials to open the
airport to the helicopters.
   Agriculture officials pledged to find someplace else to base the
choppers before tonight's scheduled malathion spraying of Garden
Grove and Panorama City.
   The state's Medfly Project lost its base at the El Monte Airport
last week after neighbors complained about noise from the nighttime
missions, which began last summer.
   Cimbaluk ruled the state failed to prove an emergency existed to
warrant an injunction. The commissioner scheduled a full hearing on
the issue for June 8.
   Meanwhile, two lawsuits filed by the city of Los Angeles and the
Natural Resources Defense Council and aimed at halting aerial
malathion spraying of urban areas are headed for court July 26,
state Assemblyman Richard Katz said.
   ``These lawsuits are designed to end the aerial spraying and
force the state to put health factors above economic
considerations,'' Katz said Tuesday.
   Agriculture officials contend the spraying and massive releases
of sterile flies are the best ways to protect California's
multibillion-dollar agriculture industry from the Mediterranean
fruit flies.
   They also maintain that the amount of malathion being sprayed is
not harmful to humans or animals. Opponents claim more study of
malathion's health effects is needed.

Commission.</NOTE>

   Overuse of standardized test scores is cutting
off education and job opportunities for countless children and
adults who are not being evaluated fairly, a commission said today.
   The National Commission on Testing and Public Policy released a
highly critical study of standardized, multiple-choice tests and
said educational and employment testing should be changed so that
the talents of all Americans are promoted.
   ``We recognize that in the past some tests have been a positive
force for numerous individuals and institutions,'' the report said.
   ``However, the growing over-reliance on testing over the past
several decades deprives the nation of much of the talent it needs
and sometimes conflicts with the nation's ideals of fairness and
equal opportunity,'' it said.
   Commission Director George Madaus said the main message is to
``move away from a single test score to select people, the way
we've been using them, to open doors, to identify talent and to
help nurture talent.''
   The commission report, ``From Gatekeeper to Gateway:
Transforming Testing in America,'' is based on a three-year study
of more than 75 reports by scholars as well as hearings across the
country.
   From 1972-85, the number of state standardized testing programs
grew from one to 34. This year, every state in the nation has a
mandated testing program.
   The study said standardized test scores often are the single
barrier keeping promising students out of schools and competent
employees from obtaining jobs or promotions.
   Madaus said today that more is at stake than simple justice for
minority groups who tend to perform relatively poorly on
standardized tests.
   ``As a practical matter, the demographics are such that these
groups are going to be more and more represented in our society,''
he said. ``We can't afford any longer to exclude them from
education and employment opportunities at which they would succeed,
on the basis of a single test score.''
   Madaus said no other industrialized Western nation has a
comparable system of standardized testing. Some use rigorous
examinations at the high school or college levels, he said, ``but
there's nothing equivalent to the elementary and secondary school
testing that we have here.''
   According to the study, tests may mislead as indicators of
performance and scores can be affected by numerous outside factors,
such as anxiety, noise level of the testing environment and
test-taking habits. All tests are to some extent culturally
dependent and almost always reflect the dominant or national
culture in both form and content, it said.
   Differences between average scores of black and white Americans
are fairly substantial, the report said, and in employment tests
only 16 percent of black Americans score above the median scores of
white Americans. Black Americans have scored on average 100 points
below white Americans on Scholastic Aptitude Tests.
   In 1988, women averaged 56 points lower than men on the SAT, the
study said.
   Hispanics, Native Americans, native Pacific Islanders, some
Asian Americans and other minorities tend to score significantly
lower on many tests, the study showed.
   There is too much educational testing, the study said, noting
that mandatory testing consumes some 20 million school days and the
equivalent of $700 million to $900 million in direct and indirect
expenditures annually.
   Each year elementary and secondary students take 127 million
separate tests mandated by states and districts. Achievement
testing is required for first graders in nine states; for second
graders in nine states; and for third graders in 27 states.
   The commission recommended banning standardized testing for all
elementary students, especially those in preschool and first grade.
   ``Four and five-year-olds are simply too young to be subjected
to standardized testing as a measure of achievement,'' said the
report. ``(The commission) hopes as a result of the study, many
governors will rely on the findings of this report to back away
from prior calls for more testing at younger levels.''
   In other recommendations, the commission called for:
   _Re-evaluating the judging of the quality of tests, the names
given to them, the way results are reported, and the ways they are
used. No testing program should be tolerated that classifies people
as unable to learn, it said.
   _Instead of merely multiple-choice tests, candidates should
supply answers, perform acts, demonstrate skills, create products
and supply portfolios.
   _Evaluating critically the fairness and accuracy of all
test-based classifications in terms of the opportunities being
allocated.
   _Test scores should not be used by themselves to determine
kindergarten entry, grade promotion, graduation, or employment
opportunities.
   _Assessment of the effectiveness of institutions and programs
should differ from assessment of individuals.
   The commission, formed by the Ford Foundation in 1987 and
administered through Boston College, is a group of education,
government, labor and business leaders.

<HEAD>Colombian Candidates Appeal for International Help in Drug War</HEAD>

   A leading presidential candidate accused
the United States and other nations of failing to do enough to help
fight drug barons, and a second candidate promised to seek United
Nations mediation in the drug war.
   ``The nations of the world have an obligation to help us,''
Alvaro Gomez said in statements published in Bogota's El Espectador
newspaper today.
   Gomez, a center-right candidate for the National Salvation
Movement, said he would ask a special U.N. drug council to analyze
earlier peace proposals by Colombia's powerful drug lords as a way
to stop terrorism.
   His opinions were echoed by front-runner Cesar Gaviria of the
governing Liberal Party.
   Gaviria said the rest of the world has left Colombia alone in
its violent drug war. He said industrialized countries such as the
United States continue to consume huge quantities of cocaine but
are not doing enough to help Colombia fight the drug barons.
   Authorities blame cocaine traffickers for killing 259 Colombians
since August, when President Virgilio Barco began his most sweeping
anti-drug crackdown.
   In the past 10 days, five car bombs have exploded in three
Colombian cities, killing 28 people and injuring about 300.
   Government officials said the new wave of terror is an attempt
by drug lords to scare people away from the polls in Sunday's
presidential elections.
   The army and police said they are mobilizing 230,000 troops to
ensure peaceful elections, in which 13.8 million Colombians are
eligible to vote.
   Military checkpoints have been placed on major streets and
highways, and armored personnel carriers and jeeps mounted with
machine guns are seen patrolling the principal cities.
   Three of the four major candidates have hinted at some sort of
accomodation with the drug lords to end the violence.
   But Gaviria, favored to win the elections, has said he will
continue the current government's hard line against the traffickers.

<HEAD>Memorial Day's Birthplace Dedicated to Holiday's Original Meaning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Memorial Day for many means picnics, beach
outings and the Indianapolis 500. And that bothers people in this
village that claims to be the holiday's birthplace. People in
Waterloo take Memorial Day seriously.
   ``The meaning of the day's been lost,'' said Joseph C. Donahue,
a retired postmaster and World War II veteran. He is co-chairman of
the Waterloo Memorial Day Committee planning next year's 125th
anniversary observance.
   ``Nowadays, Memorial Day is thought of as a reason for a
three-day weekend. A day for boat races, fishing derbies, marathon
races or fireworks. There's lot of activities, but nothing that
really has to do with Memorial Day.''
   It's difficult to say exactly where Memorial Day was first
observed. Southern communities like Columbus, Ga., and Columbus,
Miss., began paying tribute to their war dead by decorating graves
as the Civil War wound down, said Ruth Semtner, curator of
Waterloo's Memorial Day Museum.
   Carbondale, Ill., held a community observance for its Civil War
victims on April 29, 1866.
   Six days later, all businesses in Waterloo closed for the day
while local citizens honored the war dead.
   Women prepared wreaths, crosses and bouquets for each veteran's
grave, said Semtner. The community was decorated with flags at half
staff, and veterans and townspeople marched to martial music to the
three village cemeteries.
   Waterloo adopted May 30 as the observance date in 1868 when the
commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, Gen. John A. Logan,
established that day for the national observance of Decoration Day.
   The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars say
Congress' decision in 1971 to shift Memorial Day from May 30 to the
last Monday in May _ so workers can enjoy a long weekend _
diminished the holiday.
   While the two groups have lobbied to change the holiday back,
the people of Waterloo never changed the observance date from May
30.
   ``It's not intended to be a day of celebration. The Fourth of
July is a day of celebration,'' Donahue said.
   This Memorial Day, in keeping with tradition, the town will hold
a parade to the three cemeteries, with prayers at each site.
   The central New York community made its bid as the birthplace of
Memorial Day in 1965, and Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson
issued proclamations in 1966 upholding the claim.
   ``Many communities held Memorial Day-type observances,'' said
John Genung, a Waterloo mortician. ``But they all fell short in one
way or the other. They weren't formal, they weren't community-wide
or they were one-shot affairs.''
   While there is disagreement over the origin of Memorial Day,
there is a widespread accord among veterans' groups that the nation
should take the holiday more seriously.
   ``We're disturbed that it's become a nice spring holiday to go
fishing. As we get further away from the most recent war, people
tend to forget why the day is set aside as a national holiday,''
said Vern Pall from the Kansas City headquarters of the VFW.
   The holiday honors the more than 1 million American soldiers
killed since the American Revolution, he said.
   ``It's a special day. The lives we lost were special and the
causes they died for were more meaningful than a day off from
work,'' Pall said.

<HEAD>House Votes to Restrict Salvador Aid, Then Kills Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Foley comment, freeing of
$4 billion money bill; picks up 9th graf, `House and ... .</NOTE>

   The House voiced strong disagreement with
current U.S. military aid for El Salvador in a largely symbolic
vote that Speaker Thomas Foley today called a ``watershed'' in
policy toward the Central American country.
   Foley, D-Wash., said Tuesday's 250-163 vote to cut military aid
was a sign of new thinking on U.S. policy, and an indication that
``in some form, military aid will be curtailed in the future.''
   Propelled by Bush administration lobbyists and moderate
Democrats led by Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., the House reversed
course moments after that vote and killed the bill to which the aid
curbs had been attached.
   But despite the murkiness of the situation, it was apparent that
a solid majority in the chamber believes continued human rights
violations by the Salvadoran military dictate an end to what some
have called a ``blank check'' policy.
   ``The American people and the American Congress have been played
for fools'' by the military and by extremists on both the left and
right in El Salvador, said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., a sponsor of
the aid restrictions. ``This must end and it must end now.''
   Church and labor groups which had supported the aid restrictions
hailed Tuesday's vote as a significant victory, the widest margin
in favor of curbs on Salvador aid in six years.
   The Bush administration sought to dilute the victory by lobbying
hard against final passage of the underlying bill, which would have
provided authorization to send new aid to new democratic
governments in Panama and Nicaragua.
   Fanning the normal skepticism of lawmakers toward foreign aid
spending, the administration succeeded and the bill was killed, 244
to 171.
   Foley said today that having achieved a victory on the Salvador
issue, majority Democrats would move to a vote Thursday on a
separate $4 billion supplemental spending bill that includes $720
million in aid to Panama and Nicaragua. The bill, which President
Bush has urgently sought, had been held up by Democrats to gain
leverage on the Salvador issue.
   That meant the aid money _ along with more than $3 billion in
add-ons for domestic programs wanted by the administration and
individual lawmakers _ probably would win final approval before
Congress leaves Friday for a 12-day Memorial Day recess.
   House and Senate negotiators completed work on the $4 billion
measure on Tuesday after agreeing to about $2 billion in cuts from
this year's Pentagon budget to pay for some of the new spending.
   The bill includes $300 million for Nicaragua's struggling new
democratic government and $420 million for Panama.
   It also includes $110 million to help the Census Bureau complete
its lagging 1990 head count, $435 million for veterans' medical and
pension benefits, and $166 million for the Head Start program.
   Various powerful lawmakers also won approval of favored projects
for their home states. Among the largest was a $185 million
automated FBI fingerprint facility for West Virginia, home of
Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. His House
counterpart, Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., and other Southerners won
inclusion of millions in disaster relief money for their region.
   During debate on the aid restrictions Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
noted that El Salvador's decade-long civil war has cost 70,000
lives, uprooted one-fourth of the country's population and left its
economy in ruins, while the tiny country has swallowed $4 billion
in U.S. aid. ``I don't see how anyone could be satisfied with that
record,'' he said. ``It is time for a new approach.''
   The amendment adopted by the House, sponsored by Moakley and
Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., would have withheld of 50 percent of El
Salvador's $85 million in annual military aid this year and in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Under the legislation's terms, if the government failed to
pursue peace talks with leftist rebels, the rest of the aid could
be cut. If the rebels balked in peace efforts, the aid could be
restored.
   But Bush's congressional supporters argued that curbing military
aid would amount to a reward to the rebels of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, who they branded terrorists.
   ``This makes the (democratically elected) government morally
equivalent to the guerrillas, who have never participated in any
electoral process,'' complained Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.
   Opinion on Capitol Hill has turned increasingly against the
Salvadoran military since the murders last Nov. 16 of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Nine soldiers have
been charged in the murders, but there is widespread skepticism
about whether the killers will ever be brought to justice.

<TEXT>
   Aides to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev have turned down an offer for him to speak from the steps
of the Minnesota capitol, but he probably will appear in public
during a visit here next month.
   Tentative plans for Gorbachev's June 3 visit were worked out
Tuesday by a Soviet advance team and a State Department protocol
group. The groups met with Gov. Rudy Perpich and scouted sites
Gorbachev may visit during his six-hour stop in Minnesota after his
summit meeting with President Bush in Washington.
   Similar planning is under way in California, where Gorbachev
will travel after Minnesota. Although his itinerary is not yet set,
officials in San Francisco said it will include a visit with former
President Reagan and meetings with scholars at Stanford University.
   In Minnesota, Gorbachev probably will have lunch with Perpich,
then tour the Twin Cities and meet with business leaders at the
Radisson Plaza Hotel in Minneapolis, according to the tentative
plans.
   ``Nothing is set in concrete,'' said William Black, assistant
chief of protocol for the State Department. He said the decision by
Gorbachev not to speak from the Capitol steps was ``their call,''
referring to the Soviets. Perpich had said he would like the Soviet
leader to deliver a speech there.
   Soviet officials declined to discuss why Gorbachev won't speak
at the Capitol. The planners, however, are expected to schedule
some type of appearance where Gorbachev will at least be able to
wave to a crowd.
   Some details of Gorbachev's visit were to be disclosed at a news
conference later today.
   However, tentative plans call for possible stops at the Walker
Art center and the Sculpture Garden in Minneapolis. Another
possible stop is the Control Data Corp. headquarters in Bloomington.
   The only confirmed agenda item is a meeting in Minneapolis with
a small group of business and agricultural leaders.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to arrive at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport
at 1 p.m. and leave for California at 7 p.m.
   There, tentative plans confirmed by officials Tuesday include:
   _Meeting for breakfast June 4 with former President Reagan and
former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   _Speaking to the Stanford community during a visit to the campus
from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and meeting with scholars from the Hoover
Institution and the School of Business.
   _Speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce with executives from 150 West Coast businesses, Mayor
Art Agnos and Gov. George Deukmejian.
   During his June 3 stayover in San Francisco, Gorbachev will
sleep at the Pacific Heights residence of the Soviet consul
general, the San Francisco Chronicle reported today.

   Eight workers involved in the dismantling of World
War II mines in eastern Libya have been killed by an explosion, the
official Libyan news agency JANA reported Wednesday.
   JANA said the victims were a West German explosives expert, two
Libyans, three Mauritanians, a Ghanian and a Thai who were working
for a West German company. The dispatch, monitored in Rome, said
the explosion occurred Monday 60 miles southwest of Tobruk, a
coastal city near the border with Egypt.
   Northeastern Libya, a former Italian colony, was the scene of
some fierce World War II fighting involving German, British and
Australian forces, and reports of discoveries of undetonated mines
are reported occasionally.
   According to the Libyan agency, the fatal explosion Monday
involved 400 British anti-vehicle mines.

<TEXT>
   A student activist who fell to his
death while trying to avoid police was buried as a martyr and
patriot Wednesday after a funeral procession attended by thousands
of students shouting anti-government slogans.
   Riot police carrying clubs and shields remained on alert as the
procession passed through downtown Kwangju.
   In addition to denouncing the government of President Roh
Tae-woo, radicals shouted ``Drive out Yankees!'' reflecting
anti-U.S. sentiment that runs deep in this southern city.
   About 3,000 students, many wearing white Korean mourning
clothes, chanted and hummed funeral dirges as they followed the
hearse carrying the body of Shin Jan-ho, 21. Mourners waved long
colorful streamers printed with slogans.
   Shin was one of 20,000 students who came to Kwangju from around
the country to take part in protests Saturday. He suffered fatal
head injuries after jumping off a speeding train to avoid police
checkpoints.
   Violent protests have been staged for five days in Kwangju to
mark the 10th anniversary of a May 1980 civil uprising, the
bloodiest in modern Korean history. At least 84 police and 400
protesters have been injured.
   During the funeral, six students wearing white clothes and black
headbands carried a giant Korean national flag at the head of the
procession. Others carried a large photograph of the dead student.
   Hundreds of citizens watched from the sidewalks as the
procession wound along city streets to two university campuses
where funeral rites were held.
   A traditional fortune teller performed a dance for repose of the
soul at Chonnam University. Students frequently interrupted
services with dissident songs and slogans.
   ``The U.S. _ real culprit of the Kwangju massacre _ get out!''
they chanted.
   The students dispersed peacefully after the procession moved to
a cemetery outside Kwangju, where victims of the 1980 uprising are
buried.
   Radicals claim the United States condoned the military
suppression of the 1980 uprising, in which officials say 200 people
died. Kwangju citizens say the death toll was much higher.
   Anti-American sentiment is strong in Kwangju. U.S. flags are
painted on campus roadways for people to walk on, and banners and
posters showing shredded American flags are common.
   The United States denied playing a part in the suppression of
the 1980 uprising.

<HEAD>Private Guards Pose Risk To Military Security, Parliamentarians
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANNE McGOWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some private security guards hired to protect
British military bases have criminal records, are afraid of the
dark or fall asleep on the job because of overwork, according to a
parliamentary committee report.
   Some guards have even smashed windows at the bases they were
hired to protect, the House of Commons committee said.
   The report, issued late Tuesday, was based on an inquiry into
security at the bases following a series of terrorist attacks,
including the bombing of the Royal Marine Music School in
September. The bombing, claimed by the Irish Republican Army,
killed 11 people.
   There was a public outcry at the time when it was disclosed that
private guards had partial responsibility for security at the
school. Nearby residents said security had been lax.
   The report by the parliamentary select committee on defense
found the standards applied to private security guards hired by the
Ministry of Defense were far lower than those applied to the
military.
   One committee member, Bruce George of the opposition Labor
Party, called their training ``abysmally inadequate.''
   As a result, the firms offer ``a consistently unsatisfactory and
potentially dangerous'' level of service, the report said.
   Allan Rogers, Labor's spokesman on defense, said the report ``is
a fairly savage indictment of the government and of the whole
process of security.''
   He called for government regulation of the private security
industry.
   Of the 2,000 or so military facilities in Britain, 56 use
private security companies. A spokesman for the defense ministry
said security guards are used for low-level tasks to free trained
military personnel for more important work.
   Rogers said the firms are hired because it is cheaper to use
private guards than soldiers or military police.
   ``Some guards had proved to be hopeless _ physically incapable
of lifting a barrier or afraid of the dark,'' the report said. ``A
significant proportion of those presented by security companies
failed (defense ministry) vetting.''
   The report also said: ``It is evident that there is a very
serious problem with the caliber of people employed by private
security firms, arising in part from the employment of guards with
criminal records or propensities.''
   The report cited:
   _Low wages, high staff turnover and poor screening of applicants.
   _Guards falling asleep as a result of working two straight
shifts.
   _A ``significant proportion'' of guards who failed military
screening.
   _Cases of vandalism, including smashing of windows.
   The committee recommended the defense ministry not enter into
any more contracts with private security firms until the industry
is regulated by the government. It said it should consider
replacing private firms with soldiers and police.
   The parliamentary inquiry also was prompted by bombings at
Inglis Barracks at Mill Hill in north London in August 1988 and at
Clive Barracks at Tern Hill in Shropshire in February. One soldier
died and nine were injured in the Mill Hill bombing, and one
soldier was injured at Tern Hill.
   After the inquiry began, there were attacks at military centers
in Leicester and Halifax in February and two bombings last week in
London.
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to get British
forces out of Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated
province with the Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Declining Orders for Durable Goods Signal Slump in Manufacturing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods
reversed direction in April after two months of increases and fell
4.1 percent, the government said Wednesday.
   ``It kind of a coincides with the industrial production report
we saw earlier,'' which showed a 0.4 percent decline in April, said
economist Thomas Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
``It shows the manufacturing side is still sluggish and planners
are still insecure about the future.''
   The Commerce Department said durable goods orders to U.S.
factories totaled a seasonally adjusted $123.3 billion for the
month. The decline erased nearly half of the 8.9 percent gain
during the previous two months after a record 10.5 percent drop in
January.
   But excluding the transportation sector, orders for durable
goods _ items expected to last at least three years _ were off just
0.1 percent in April.
   ``The volatility in orders the last four months is attributable
to the transportation equipment industry,'' the department said.
``Excluding transportation, orders have been relatively flat.''
   Declines in both aircraft and automobile orders in April caused
a 14.3 percent drop in the transportation sector to $31.6 billion.
The drop followed gains of 23.4 percent in March and 10.1 percent
in February. Transportation orders had plunged 29.4 percent in
January.
   Both Runiewicz and Kris Bledowski, an economist with Cahners
Economics in Newton, Mass., said they expect the manufacturing
economy to pick up later this year.
   ``Investment spending will rebound after a year and a half of
depressed spending that was caused by lower profits,'' Bledowski
said. ``And I would see a tremendous pull from Europe that is going
to grow this year much, much more robustly than the United States
... that would stimulate demand for U.S. exports.''
   Runiewicz also said he expects consumer spending in the United
States to pick up in the second half.
   Non-defense capital goods orders, often a barometer of business
investment plans, were down 9.7 percent to $36.9 billion after
rising 13.3 percent in March.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 2.3 percent to $122.1 billion,
but unfilled orders inched up 0.2 percent to $497.8 billion.
   ``The one positive note is that unfilled orders are still on the
plus side,'' Runiewicz said. ``It means there's still a backlog
there.''
   A backlog of orders means there less chance of production
cutbacks and loss of jobs.
   The electrical machinery sector posted the only gain, up 4.5
percent to $20.4 billion. Most of the increase represented defense
communications equipment. The sector had slipped 2.1 percent the
previous month after a 2.8 percent advance in February.
   Non-electrical machinery orders fell 2.5 percent to $21.8
billion after being unchanged in March. They had edged down 0.6
percent the previous month.
   Orders for primary metals also dropped, down 1.5 percent to
$11.6 billion after rising 7.9 percent in March and falling 4.2
percent in February.
   Excluding defense, durable goods orders decreased 4.5 percent.
   Defense orders were up 2.3 percent to $7.9 billion on top of
gains of 0.6 percent and 18.3 percent in March and February.

<HEAD>Commuter Train Writes Late Notes For Tardy Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Late for work and need an excuse? A commuter rail
service is happy to provide a note _ but only if the tardy employee
rode a delayed train.
   ``In the railroad industry business tardiness is not
tolerated,'' said Sharon Austin, a division manager for Metra, a
commuter rail service.
   ``So we can sympathize with people who are worried because they
arrive late to their jobs at a bank or office.
   A note might read: ``To whom it may concern: This is to advise
that Metra-Electric trains were unavoidably delayed due to
difficulties encountered in suburban service on this date.''
   Ms. Austin said she once copied a note 200 times for sailors.
   ``They were only 17 and 18 years old and scared out of their
wits that they'd be considered AWOL,'' Ms. Austin said.

   A soldier whose brother was facing drug
charges opened fire outside a courthouse during an escape attempt,
and the two men and a policeman were killed in the shootout that
followed, a newspaper said Wednesday.
   Ten others were injured in the violent getaway attempt Tuesday
in the southern town of Songkhla, the Bangkok Post reported. About
100 police took part in the hourlong shootout, in which the
brothers threw hand grenades and fired a hundreds of rounds from
M-16 and AK-47 assault rifles, the Post said.
   The escape attempt began when a policeman was escorting Suphon
Phetchara from the courtroom after the defendant had met with his
lawyer, the newspaper said. Suphon's brother, Sunthorn, pointed a
pistol at the officer and ordered the release of Suphon, who was
charged with narcotics and weapons trafficking.
   Sunthorn fired three shots, which missed the policeman. The
newspaper said he and Suphon ran to a pickup truck and fled, chased
by police on motorcycles.
   About a half-mile from the courthouse, the truck crashed into
another truck, injuring the driver of the second vehicle and three
passengers.
   About 100 policemen then surrounded the getaway truck, and a
fierce shootout began. The brothers were killed, along with a
policeman, the newspaper said.
   Interior Minister Banharn Silpa Archa, who visited the city 590
miles south of Bangkok, was quoted as saying security at courts
would have to be strengthened.

   Striking union members returned to work at
Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. today and began voting by mail on a
new contract for installers, linemen and directory assistance
operators.
   ``We're back out there giving service,'' said Chuck Givin,
spokesman for the Communications Workers of America.
   Members of CWA Locals 4400 and 4401 held a combined meeting
Tuesday and were briefed on the tentative three-year agreement
reached by negotiators Monday.
   Union employees began returning to work at midnight, ending a
nine-day strike.
   Mail ballots are to be counted by June 19, Givin said.
   Union employees walked off the job nine days ago when Bell
negotiators demanded that they agree to pay part of their health
insurance cost and that some lower-paid workers take pay cuts.
   The company dropped those demands during negotiations.
   The contract affects about 2,900 installers, linemen and
information operators. It provides a 7 percent wage increase over
three years; a profit-sharing plan that could add 9 percent in
compensation over three years; and improvements in dental and
vision insurance, a savings plan and pension plan, according to
Cincinnati Bell spokeswoman Cyndy Cantoni.
   Cincinnati Bell serves about 580,000 customers in the Cincinnati
area and neighboring parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern
Indiana.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
today there were problems with U.S. nuclear artillery shells in
Europe, but he said they have been fixed and there was never any
danger of an accidental nuclear explosion.
   A published report said some experts feared a possible
accidental nuclear explosion if the problems were not solved.
   ``It is important here not to over-dramatize the nature of the
problem,'' Cheney said. ``I will simply say that ... there was no
danger but that the shells in question did not meet the very high
standards that we have. I don't believe there was any cause for
concern.''
   He declined to go into details of what was done to correct the
problems, saying such matters were classified.
   Cheney, speaking at a news conference after wrapping up a
two-day session with NATO defense ministers, was responding to a
story in today's editions of The Washington Post. It said the
United States was repairing artillery shells and examining the
design of two kinds of missiles because of the possibility of an
accidental nuclear explosion.
   Cheney said he was not certain at what point the German
government had been informed of potential problems with the
artillery shells.
   Maj. Gen. Dieter Wellershoff, West German chief of staff who
briefed West German reporters in Brussels, said the U.S. had told
Bonn of ``technical changes'' on the nuclear warheads. Spokesman
Klaus Naumann said the West German military was informed before and
after these technical changes were completed.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he saw no reason to
demand immediate withdrawal of the nuclear artillery. But he said
the government hoped that ``a situation would come soon whereby the
nuclear artillery could be scrapped.''
   In the Netherlands, where some U.S. nuclear weapons are based,
Defense Ministry spokesman Martijn Verbrugge said, ``We are always
informed when the Americans are planning maintenance'' on warheads
stored there. He refused to say whether or when Dutch officials
were told about the problems reported by the Post today.
   U.S. troops in Europe were warned not to move the shells until
they are fixed, the paper said.
   The problem with the W-79 shell, designed for eight-inch
howitzers, was one of three found recently by Energy Department
experts, the newspaper said.
   A special committee will be appointed to review the W-88 warhead
atop the new D-5 missile being deployed on Trident submarines this
year, the Post said.
   And it said special flight restrictions have been instituted
pending review of the W-69 warhead on the short-range SRAM-A
missile carried by some bomber aircraft.
   The W-88 and W-69 warheads use the same volatile fuel that
experts feared could explode in certain accidents and set off the
conventional explosives that trigger the nuclear explosives.
   Those conventional explosives surround a mass of plutonium and
compress it from all sides to the point where the nuclear chain
reaction begins and proceeds to cause a nuclear explosion in a
split second.
   The artillery shell problem was discovered by special computer
studies using new, more powerful computers in 1988, the Post said.
   Those studies raised the possibility that a bullet striking the
conventional explosive could set off part of it, dispersing the
highly toxic plutonium, though not necessarily causing a chain
reaction. At least a dozen such accidents are known to have
occurred in the nuclear age.
   But if the bullet hit while the shell were in the artillery
piece, the barrel of the weapon might reflect even neutrons back
into the plutonium to cause a nuclear explosion, according to the
experts' thinking as described by the Post.
   The W-88 was feared to be vulnerable to an accidental nuclear
explosion, but the W-69 threat was dispersal of plutonium, the
newspaper said.
   An unidentified senior military official was quoted as saying,
``For a while, we were worried that these things might go off if
they fell of the back of a truck and landed in a certain way.''
   Special teams early in 1989 installed ``safing mechanisms,'' and
the shells are being modified, the Post said.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, though declining to discuss
specifics or confirm all details, was quoted as saying in an
interview, ``Without any question, safety has been preserved'' for
the artillery shell.
   ``I can confirm that the admiral was concerned about nuclear
weapons safety,'' said M.J. Jameson, the energy secretary's
spokeswoman. As to details, ``I'm not at liberty to talk about
that.''
   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr., D-S.C., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on defense nuclear facilities, confirmed that
the subcommittee had called for an inquiry by a panel of
non-governmental physicists into the safety and security of U.S.
nuclear forces.
   Spratt's office released a letter sent to Watkins on May 3
advising him of the planned inquiry, along with Watkins' reply
agreeing to cooperate. Spratt said in the letter that the
subcommittee knew the department was already taking action but
believed that ``an independent assessment will be as valuable to
the department as it will be to Congress.''
   When Watkins arrived at DOE last year, he learned of several
``highly visible'' safety problems. He started investigating and at
some point he recommended the creation of a subcommittee of the
nuclear weapons council, a joint DoE-DoD body, which was done, she
said.
   ``He felt that the secretary of energy should place a greater
emphasis on nuclear weapons safety,'' she said.

   Dozens of rockets rained down on the
Afghan capital Wednesday, killing three people and injuring 12,
Afghanistan's state-run radio reported.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 26 U.S-made rockets
slammed into Kabul's residential districts, destroying several
homes and landing next to a mosque.
   No one accepted responsibility for the barrage. The radio blamed
``Pakistan-backed extremists,'' an apparent reference to Moslem
guerrillas financed by the United States and headquartered in
Pakistan.
   For the past 12 years, the insurgents have been fighting to
topple Kabul's Communist-style government.
   The guerrillas deny targeting civilian areas but admit they
occasionally misfire.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on President Gorbachev's tour:
   Mikhail Gorbachev's decision to visit Minnesota has the
potential to focus the eyes of the word on this nation's heartland.
   The Soviet president will visit Minneapolis on June 3, where he
is expected to meet with business and agriculture leaders.
   If there is one place where this man, who offers himself as a
visionary for a better world, can learn about the American way, it
is in the Midwest.
   Just as Soviet Premier Nikita Kruschev did during his 1959 trip
to an Iowa farm, Gorbachev will come in touch with the values and
work ethic of people who make a major contribution to the strength
of the free world.
   Despite political differences, there is an intrigue with the
style of this Soviet leader that makes him more likeable than those
who have preceded him.
   There is still need for progress. The summit with President Bush
offers one opportunity to further advance those relations. The trip
to the heartland offers Gorbachev the opportunity to shake hands
with the kind of people who have made a difference. It will be
worth his time.

   The Times, London, on disarmament:
   Stressing the toughness of talks so as to claim noble
achievements is an old tactic, and President Gorbachev and the
American Secretary of State James Baker made full use of it last
week in Moscow.
   With one exception _ the U.S.-Soviet agreement on chemical
weapons _ Washington's references to dramatic breakthroughs should
be read as expectations deliberately lowered. On almost every point
on the agenda for the Washington summit on May 31, including
agreement on a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (Start), serious
obstacles remain. ...
   There is little doubt that negotiations came close to breakdown.
... First, the shadow of Lithuania loomed larger over the Moscow
talks than either side admitted at the time. ... Second was the
failure to make any real progress through the current stalemate on
reducing conventional forces in Europe.
   This failure was a sure indication of the tension that has now
entered Soviet-American relations.

   The Marion (Ohio) Star on Bush-Lithuania:
   President Bush, defending his cautious approach to the
Lithuanian crisis, could have called on Emerson, the 19th-century
yankee sage who once observed that there is action in inaction.
Instead, the president quoted a more recent Yankee thinker.
   ``I don't want to make the wrong mistake,'' baseball Hall of
Famer Yogi Berra is supposed to have said. Neither does the
president.
   His remarks recently were not as flippant as the Yogi allusion
suggests. In fact, they were refreshingly candid and absolutely
correct. ...
   The president said he wanted to avoid any action ``that would
set back the cause of freedom around the world.'' Lithuanian
officials reacted bitterly.
   Those same officials need to realize that their right to be free
and independent is not the question. The question has to do with
such practical considerations as timing and process and political
reality. Those considerations dictate moderation and compromise.
President Bush, like Yogi Berra, understands that.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the population growth:
   Right now, there are 5.3 billion human types walking this planet
Earth. That number, says the United Nations Population Fund, could
approximate 15 billion in 100 years, a scant five generations into
the future.
   During this present decade ... it is projected that another
billion people will be added to humankind's total, that's at a rate
of 100 million a year, roughly 275,000 a day.
   Big numbers. And they translate into big problems.
   At the present population level, we are unable to feed
ourselves, whether the problem be one of production, distribution
or economics. The horror stories of hunger and starvation
throughout the world are brought to our attention daily.
   If the demand for food cannot be met now, what lies ahead? If
the unacceptable pressures brought to bear on our environment by
five billion people are trebled, what lies ahead?
   The United Nations report says decisive action is needed to slow
population growth. The United Nations is right. And because the
United Nations is an organization that transcends national
boarders, it must play the leading role in determining what lies
ahead. As the UN says, the alternative to action is to leave our
children a ``poisoned inheritance.''

   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on drugs:
   Two psychologists at the University of California, Berkeley, say
experimenting with drugs can be a sign of normal adolescent
development. And they question the ``just say no'' approach to
completely abstain from drugs.
   Jonathan Shedler and Jack Block concluded that adolescents who
experiment with drugs tend to be better adjusted than abstainers or
abusers. They say self-control may be more critical than
abstinence. ...
   The study found drug abuse is a symptom of psychological
problems originating in childhood and made worse by parents.
   While some may misinterpret the study as approving of some drug
use, it did not do so. It found, for example, that at age 18, those
who used marijuana once a week or more were alienated, lacking in
ability to control their impulses and distressed, compared with
experimenters. But it also found those who abstained were anxious,
emotionally constricted and lacking in social skills, compared with
experimenters. The study defined experimenters as those who used
marijuana or another illegal drug no more than once a month.
   Shedler said the study's conclusions ``absolutely do not mean
drug experimentation is something that is beneficial. But it does
mean that some limited drug experimentation may not be
catastrophic. It could be a sign of trouble to come or simply a
sign of normal adolescent exploration.''
   Shedler says more effective anti-drug efforts would identify
``at risk'' children who would tend to have drug problems later in
life, and counsel them.

   Floodwaters began leveling off at Lake
Livingston Dam and were expected to crest today downstream in
southeastern Texas, where the rain-swollen Trinity River surged
over a milelong levee in Liberty.
   ``If I had to pick a cutoff day _ a day when this would start
turning around _ it would be today,'' said Jim Mitchum, Liberty
County Emergency Management coordinator. ``I think we're getting
the worst of it now.''
   The Trinity River Authority dropped the release of waters
through the dam to 82,500 cubic feet per second early today. After
four days of record-setting 100,800 cfs releases, the authority
began dropping the rate Monday to 96,000 cfs and to 93,600 cfs on
Tuesday.
   One cubic foot of water equals 7.5 gallons.
   The lake level, considered full at 131 feet, peaked at 132.88
feet Friday and dropped at 131.82 feet today.
   Elsewhere, floodwaters receded in Arkansas and wheat farmers in
Lousiana harvested their crops early. Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh
declared southern Indiana eligible for state disaster assistance.
   Heavy flooding since April 15 has been blamed for 13 deaths in
Texas and one in Oklahoma. Flooding and storms elsewhere have
killed two people in Illinois and one in Missouri.
   The floods have caused an estimated $300 million in damage in
Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. So far, 79 counties in
Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas have been declared eligible for
federal disaster assistance.
   Five Red Cross centers serving seven flood-ravaged counties in
southeastern Texas began interviews Tuesday to arrange food
deliveries, clothing, temporary housing, household furnishings and
medical aid.
   ``I've got five kids and couldn't get anybody to rent to me
because of that,'' said Melba Scott, 24, who's been out of her
South Liberty home for two weeks.
   The Red Cross has estimated more than 4,600 homes have been
affected by flooding in the seven counties. The agency has
sheltered more than 500 people and provided meals to some 9,000
since the river was forced from its banks by torrential rains more
than two weeks ago some 200 miles to the north.
   Workers in Liberty have been hauling truckloads of dirt and
sandbags to a levee to protect high-priced lakefront homes and a
drainage ditch leading into town. The levee has been raised about 2
feet in an effort to stay ahead of the floodwater.
   ``Our crews are working their hearts out,'' city secretary Beth
Staton said. ``But as soon as we get one low spot fixed, the waters
seems to come over someplace else,'' she said.
   In Arkansas, floodwaters receded in Garland County, where
victims met Tuesday with Gov. Bill Clinton at a disaster relief
center in Hot Springs. A 24-hour deluge of 13 inches of rain over
the weekend caused flash flooding.
   ``We're trying to find a place to sleep and a way to clean our
clothes,'' said Brownie Mitchell, one of 150 residents who applied
for aid. ``We don't have immediate money to draw from for our
families to have a place to sleep.''
   In Lousiana, wheat farmers in Brouillette, where the Red and
Black rivers converge, are harvesting their crops in a race against
time.
   Runoff from heavy rain to the north is pushing downstream and is
expected to flood parts of Catahoula and Avoyelles parishes next
month.
   Brouillette farmers who erected a makeshift levee against the
rising Red River are afraid it won't hold back the water. The
12-mile levee is protecting about 20,000 acres of wheat and
recently planted corn and dozens of homes.
   Avoyelles Parish Civil Defense Director Cindy Dupuy said
Brouillette farmers will lose money by harvesting their wheat so
early but have no choice.
   ``We want to get it out,'' Miss Dupuy said.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Sammy Davis Jr. and Jim Henson:
   They were among the most familiar entertainers of their time _
the high-spirited song-and-dance man whose smile was as bright as
his copious gold jewelry; the gentle puppeteer with long hair and a
bushy beard who turned a felt frog into a soft-voiced friend,
philosopher and secret romantic. The deaths of Sammy Davis Jr. and
Jim Henson take something away from all of us, but especially from
children.
   Davis, who succumbed to throat cancer in Los Angeles at age 64,
symbolized the triumph of talent and tenacity over racism.
   Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, the Cookie Monster, and
dozens of other Muppet characters, died suddenly in New York
Hospital at age 53.
   Davis' recordings have long been classics; Henson's films and
cartoons are staples of practically any video store. The ebullience
and sparkle these men brought us in life is gone, but their
creative gifts will long endure to entertain us and our children.

   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside County, Calif., on video games
and reality:
   Nintendo, the Japanese computer gamester, has announced it will
donate $3 million over five years to the pioneering Media
Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The idea is to
help children learn while they're having fun. Certainly these two
parties are equipped to do that. But the sight of them shaking
hands produces a vague sense of uneasiness. ...
   Commercially, Nintendo's instincts have been impeccable. Their
game machines now are in one of five American homes. But charges of
monopolistic practices swirl around Nintendo. American rival Atari
has filed an antitrust suit and the Justice Department has been
asked to investigate it.
   Much of this stems from Nintendo's practice of tying its
software designers up with exclusive contracts that prevent them
from adapting successful games to anyone else's hardware systems.
   To these charges Nintendo's president Hiroshi Yamauchi replies:
``If our terms are so strict they make people unhappy, they're
always free not to accept them.'' Yes, they are: Free to walk away
from an association with the outfit which controls 80 percent of
the market.
   But then these decisions always cost something. As do the
decisions on what proprietary interest Nintendo may claim in any
research breakthroughs this union with MIT may produce.
   Perhaps it's that aspect of things, that pitting of ethics
versus instinct, that gives rise to the sense of uneasiness. One
side seems to have a head start.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on college athletics:
   There are too many incidents of recruiting violations, players
who spend little time in classes and just plain bad behavior in
college athletics. A better system than the one now in place is
obviously needed to control such abuses.
   Two attempts at imposing controls surfaced in recent days. One
is a good idea. The other isn't. If the good idea is not acted on,
the bad idea may be imposed.
   The good idea was embodied in a Washington meeting that brought
together men and women coaches and college presidents. Basketball
topics ranged from shoe contracts to graduation rates to tenure to
recruiting violations.
   Notre Dame's Digger Phelps suggested that a sport czar replace
the National Collegiate Athletic Association as rulemaker and
disciplinarian.
   Indiana's Bobby Knight touched on tenure. ``When a coach loses
his job and we know he's a good coach, we know he's an honest guy,
we wonder, `What do I have to do to keep my job?''' Knight said.
   Knight also said that a school's athletic scholarships ought to
be based on its graduation rate.
   Louisiana State's Dale Brown and North Carolina's Dean Smith
pointed to potential problems with the contracts coaches sign with
manufacturers of athletic shoes.
   The good idea is that coaches and university presidents see the
need for new action to rid college athletics of abuses.
   The bad idea was on display in Springfield, Ill., where a bill
was introduced in the state legislature to make the NCAA's list of
recruiting violations part of the criminal code. That's a poor idea
for two reasons:
   _ First, such a proposal would add another complex duty to law
enforcement's list of chores. Abuses in college athletics are
serious, but not nearly as serious as other problems police and
prosecutors are asked to solve.
   _ Second, while the Illinois proposal may die in the
legislature, it is a sign that people are unhappy with athletics in
state-supported schools. In effect, introduction of the proposal
says that if schools don't police themselves, others will take on
the job.
   Those in college athletics _ presidents and coaches in
particular _ must do more of what they were doing in Washington. If
they don't, they will eventually see what was proposed in
Springfield enacted into law.

<HEAD>Study Finds Differences in How Fat and Lean People Store Extra
Calories</HEAD>

   A study helps explain one of nature's injustices _
why some people can eat with abandon and stay slim while others put
on weight with the slightest dining no-no.
   The answer is individual differences in what the body does with
unneeded calories. Some folks tend to store them as fat, others lay
them down as muscle.
   Since building lean tissue uses up much more energy than storing
fat, fat makers grow fat, while muscle makers stay trim. Many
people seem to fall somewhere between these two extremes.
   The findings come from a unique experiment. Doctors put 12 pairs
of identical twins on diets in which they ate 1,000 more calories
each day than their bodies needed, and they got almost no exercise.
   When it started, all were slim men in their early 20s with no
family history of obesity. After 84 days, they had all eaten 84,000
excess calories, but some had grown fat, while others stayed
relatively trim.
   The man who gained the most weight put on 29 pounds and stored
up every extra calorie somewhere on his body. The man who gained
the least added 9 pounds and stored only 40 percent of the extra
calories.
   ``It demonstrates for the first time that for a given amount of
calories, you have differences in the body's response to the
surplus of energy,'' said Dr. Claude Bouchard, who directed the
study. ``The individual differences are amazing. They are huge.''
   The study suggests that individual differences determine to what
degree people resist, or succumb, to the excess calories they take
in when they eat an ice cream cone or an extra hamburger.
   ``Almost 40 percent of the weight gain is explained by the
propensity to store in the form of lean or fat tissue,'' said
Bouchard. ``This is the single most important variable that has
been presented in the literature to account for differences in
weight gain.''
   Bouchard's study, performed at Laval University in Ste. Foy,
Quebec, in 1988 and 1989 was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine. In the same issue was another twin study
conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and an editorial by Dr.
Ethan A.H. Sims of the University of Vermont.
   Sims wrote that Bouchard's work ``will become a classic study.''
   Because Bouchard's experiment was conducted on genetically
identical twins, he was able to provide more evidence to support
the widely held idea that obesity is at least partly an inherited
disorder.
   When one man put on a lot of weight in the study, his twin
tended to do the same. The study found that there was three times
more variation in weight gain between pairs than within pairs.
   The study also found close links between twins regarding whether
they tended to grow pot bellies or big bottoms.
   In the study, the doctors first determined how much each
volunteer needed to eat to stay the same weight and then added
1,000 extra calories to each's diet. They lived under
around-the-clock supervision in college dormitories and were
allowed to take a half-hour walk each day. But otherwise they did
nothing more strenuous than play cards or watch television.
   Experts believe that other factors also contribute to how people
handle calories. These include their metabolic rates _ the amount
of calories their bodies need to keep going while resting _ and how
much they fidget.
   All the extra blubber did not stick long to the Quebec men. They
lost the weight within six months.
   In the Pennsylvania study, researchers examined 673 pairs of
identical and fraternal twins in Sweden. About half of the pairs
were raised together, while the rest had been separated at birth.
   They found genes could explain most of the difference in
people's weights, although there was a slight sex difference.
Genetic influences accounted for 70 percent of the differences in
fatness among men and 66 percent in women.
   Their childhood home environments had no effect at all on
whether they grew up to be heavy or slim. Four years ago, the same
group found that twins who had been put up for adoption grew to
have the body builds of their biological parents, not the people
who raised them.
   In his editorial, Sims said the two latest reports show that
``destiny, in the form of our genetic makeup, has a great deal to
do with the shape of our middles.''

<TEXT>
   Ivan Boesky brought his command of Wall Street
to federal court, calmly admitting to insider trading and giving a
jury a lesson in risk arbitrage, leveraged buyouts _ and deliveries
of briefcases full of cash.
   Appearing relaxed on the stand in the trial of former associate
John A. Mulheren Jr., Boesky delivered his first public testimony
Tuesday since his 1986 plea bargain, centerpiece of the nation's
biggest insider trading scandal.
   Boesky spoke in a deep strong voice, occasionally adjusting the
microphone when it failed to pick up his words.
   When a juror complained she couldn't hear his answers, he
suggested he and the prosecutor go over the testimony again. That
command is usually reserved for the judge, who put a finger over
her lips in a hushing gesture to Boesky.
   Later, U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum had to
admonish him for answering questions before they were asked.
   Resumption of Boesky's testimony was delayed this morning
because of a sick juror. Mulheren, a diagnosed manic depressive,
told reporters outside the court that he's trying not to let the
trial bother him.
   ``When you face the kinds of things I face every morning, you
don't get upset about things like this,'' Mulheren said. ``Try
being a manic depressive for a while.''
   Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count in 1986 and paid $100
million in penalties. He served two years in prison and gave the
government incriminating information about a number of associates,
including Mulheren.
   Boesky is the government's main witness in Mulheren's securities
fraud trial. The biggest drama could come later; Mulheren's lawyer,
Thomas Puccio, is expected to grill Boesky about his own
credibility and criminal past.
   Dressed in a charcoal suit and dark blue tie, testified that he
received inside information about proposed takeovers from former
investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel, and that he had
agreed to pay them up to 5 percent of his firm's profits for their
help.
   He said he never gave Levine any money. Siegel, however,
received $800,000 in three cash deliveries, Boesky said.
   ``It was assembled by a colleague out of my personal accounts,
put into a briefcase and handed by an intermediary to Mr. Siegel,''
Boesky said.
   A fourth cash delivery was canceled when he received word of a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Levine's
dealings, he said.
   ``Did you understand you were committing a crime when you traded
on inside information from Dennis Levine?,'' asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney Scott Gilbert.
   ``Yes,'' Boesky said.
   Boesky, who credited Mulheren with saving his business from
collapse in 1982, said Mulheren was one of the few friends with
whom he shared the information he received from Levine and Siegel,
although he never revealed its source.
   Mulheren, 40, is accused of manipulating a stock price and
concealing ownership of other stocks to help Boesky cheat on his
taxes and evade securities laws. He faces up to five years in
prison and $250,000 fine on each of 41 counts.
   Boesky avoided looking at Mulheren, who once was trustee of
Boesky's children's trust funds but later allegedly plotted to
assassinate Boesky when he learned the speculator had fingered him.
Weapons charges were later dropped.
   ``He wouldn't look at me,'' said the eccentric Mulheren as he
left the courtroom in a red leather bomber jacket with 1940s air
speed records stitched on the back.
   Under questioning, Boesky recounted his days as the son of a
Detroit restaurant owner and his rise to head of his own Wall
Street firm.
   He stopped now and then to explain a term to the jury. He left
the stand to explain risk arbitrage, using a chart prepared by the
prosecution.
   Siegel and Levine, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. banker
who first implicated Boesky in wrongdoing, have pleaded guilty.
Levine agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Siegel is awaiting
sentencing.

<HEAD>Commission Criticizes Reliance on Standardized Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simple justice and workplace realities demand
that American schools and employers stop relying on flawed
standardized tests to decide who gets ahead, a private commission
said Wednesday.
   Low test scores should ``never stigmatize an individual as a
failure or permanently restrict the individual's life choices,''
the Ford Foundation's National Commission on Testing and Public
Policy said in a report.
   But the panel of education, government, business and labor
leaders said standardized test scores are often the single barrier
keeping promising students out of schools or competent employees
from advancing.
   The group recommended a series of steps designed to improve the
accuracy as well as reduce the influence of the tests that many
Americans must take to qualify for everything from kindergarten to
office promotions.
   Among the panel's conclusions: Tests should promote human
talents rather than inhibit them; multiple-choice tests should be
replaced with better methods of evaluation, and test results alone
should not be used to make any major judgments about a person.
   The report noted that minority groups and women _ vital to the
workforce of the future _ score lower than white males on many
aptitude and achievement tests.
   ``We can't afford any longer to exclude them from education and
employment opportunities in which they would succeed, on the basis
of a single test score,'' said commission director George Madaus.
   ``This report doesn't constitute a special plea for
minorities,'' said commission chairman Bernard Gifford. ``What the
report constitutes is a call to common sense. It argues that tests
should be used where appropriate to the task at hand.''
   The commission opposes standardized testing of preschool and
elementary children but did not recommend a ban in its report.
   Instead, noting that such tests are mandated or widely used in
most states, the panel said test results should not by themselves
determine kindergarten entry, grade promotion or, later in life,
graduation or job opportunities.
   The report said standardized testing has become pervasive across
the country. One state had a mandated testing program in 1972 while
all 50 had them in 1989, it said. Elementary and secondary students
take 127 million mandated tests a year, using 20 million school
days and costing up to $915 million in direct and indirect
expenditures, the report said.
   For all the money and time and effort, the report said, the
tests can be highly misleading. They almost always reflect the
dominant national culture, accounting for the score gap suffered by
minorities, and scores can be affected by any number of factors
ranging from anxiety to noise level.
   Students and job-seekers would be evaluated more fairly if they
had to supply answers and portfolios, perform acts, demonstrate
skills and create products rather than simply fill out
multiple-choice exams, the commission said.
   Madaus said no other industrialized Western nation has a
comparable system of standardized testing. Some use rigorous
examinations at the high school or college levels, he said, ``but
there's nothing equivalent to the elementary and secondary school
testing that we have here.''
   The commission was formed in 1987 by the Ford Foundation and is
administered through Boston College. Its report, ``From Gatekeeper
to Gateway: Transforming Testing in America,'' is based on a study
of more than 100 research papers by scholars and hearings conducted
in San Antonio, Honolulu, Washington and Albuquerque.

   Masked men opened fire with
machine guns on two officers standing guard outside Londonderry
police headquarters, and one of them was critically wounded,
authorities said Wednesday.
   The second officer escaped injury, but two women walking nearby
were treated for shock after narrowly avoiding the gunfire, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   The Constabulary said five or six masked men ambushed the
officers late Tuesday while they were on guard at a security
checkpoint outside the headquarters building.
   Police said the wounded officer's partner returned the fire, but
the attackers got away.
   A number of people were arrested in connection with the
shooting, said a Constabulary spokesman, who was not named in
keeping with British custom.
   No one claimed responsibility for the shooting, but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army. The spokesman noted that the IRA
has carried out similar attacks in the past.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   NASA said Wednesday it has completed

liftoff next week.
   ``We don't have any significant problems going into the flight
readiness review'' on Thursday, said agency spokewoman Lisa Malone.
Mission managers planned to set an official launch date at the
meeting.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
working toward a Wednesday liftoff.
   Columbia's flight with seven astronauts and the $100 million
Astro observatory was delayed two weeks because of a bad cooling
valve that had to be replaced in the shuttle's payload bay.
   Technicians began removing a makeshift platform and other work
items Wednesday after performing a final check of the cooling
system.
   It will be the first Spacelab mission since 1985 and the 36th

<TEXT>
   President Bush spoke by telephone to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak but did not offer to increase further the
number of Soviet Jews permitted to enter the United States,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today.
   The Arabs are concerned about the heavy influx of Jews into
Israel _ many from the Soviet Union _ especially those settling on
the West Bank, in Gaza and in Easter Jerusalem.
   Baker's comments were in response to an Israeli radio report. It
quoted an Egyptian presidential spokesman as saying Bush had told
Mubarak steps were being taken to enlarge the number of Soviet Jews
allowed to come to the United States.
   Baker, at a White House news conference, said Bush had spoken by
phone today with Mubarak.
   However, Baker added, ``It is my understanding that the
president did not offer to take in more Soviet Jews.''
   Baker said, however, that as many as 70,000 Soviet emigres
already are expected to come into the United States this year _ up
from 50,000 in 1989 and 14,000 in 1988.
   ``So we are increasing the number of Soviet emigres that we
receive in the United States,'' Baker said.
   The secretary of state added that it was his understanding that
Bush did not give Mubarak a commitment to further increase those
levels.

<HEAD>Lawyer Acquitted in Ashland Oil Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer was cleared today of charges stemming
from a scheme with former Ashland Oil Co. Chairman Orin Atkins to
sell confidential Ashland documents to the Iranian National Oil Co.
   Atkins, who pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and wire
fraud, had been a key witness against the attorney, Charles Barnett
of Palm Beach, Fla.
   A jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan acquitted Barnett,
39, of conspiracy and six counts of wire fraud after a four-week
trial.
   The government had alleged that Barnett participated in a plan
to sell the documents to the Iranians for use in a lawsuit against
Ashland, which had not paid $283 million for seven tanker loads of
oil.
   One of the jurors, Jack Perlstein, said the jurors followed
instructions from U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo that they
acquit Barnett if they found Ashland had defrauded the Iranians.
   ``We felt the defendant may have been guilty, but we went by the
judge's charge,'' Perlstein said.
   Atkins had testified that after he resigned in 1981 as Ashland
chairman but remained at the Kentucky oil concern as a consultant,
he improperly obtained 259 corporate documents and tried to sell
them to the Iranians for millions of dollars.
   Prosecutors alleged that Barnett became involved through his
late father, Barney Barnett, who was a close friend of Atkins.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Herve Gouraige said during the trial
that the younger Barnett was instrumental in getting the Iranians
to agree to the alleged scheme, although no money ever changed
hands.
   The Iranian company eventually sued, and the case was resolved
last summer when Ashland agreed to pay $325 million to settle the
claim.
   Barnett testified his efforts were legitimate legal work to help
the Iranians collect money from Ashland.
   ``During this time I was simply accommodating a client of the
firm and an old friend of the family,'' Barnett said. ``My feeling
was that (Iranian oil company) had been defrauded and that they
deserved to get the money which they were due.''
   At the trial, prosecutors presented a videotape of a secretly
recorded meeting between Atkins and another conspirator, Roy
Furmark, who had agreed to cooperate with investigators.
   The videotape showed Atkins urging Furmark to close the deal
with the Iranians because he needed money.

<HEAD>Dolphin Dies After Rescue from Thames</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young dolphin that became stranded on the shore
of the Thames River died five hours after an elaborate rescue
operation, a veterinarian said Wednesday.
   ``It was critically ill when it got here and was suffering from
pneumonia and a lot of skin damage through having been too long in
fresh water,'' John Taylor said at Windsor Safari Park.
   A second dolphin has been spotted swimming with the one that was
retrieved Tuesday. Taylor went to the river Wednesday to determine
whether it could be saved.
   ``It will surely die like the other if it is left there,'' he
said. ``These animals are tired and sick after swimming about 40
miles from the sea to the center of London.''
   After the first dolphin was rescued, a veterinarian swam with it
an isolation pool filled with mildly salty water in an effort to
keep it alive.
   The police, fire service and Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals participated in an elaborate rescue operation
after the dolphin, which they named Phoenix, was spotted beached on
a gravel bank of the Thames near Vauxhall Bridge.
   Taylor said the dolphins may have come up the river from the
North Sea in pursuit of salmon, which have returned to the
cleaned-up Thames after a 145-year absence.
   Porpoises were also seen in the Thames last week.

   President Bush will press Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit meeting to revive negotiations
to remove tens of thousands of troops and tanks from Europe,
Secretary of State James A. Baker said today.
   Baker, outlining Bush's agenda for the May 31-June 3 summit,
also said the president will try to keep the talks from being
impeded by unrest in the breakaway republic of Lithuania.
   Baker said it is important that a treaty be signed this year to
cut U.S. and Soviet non-nuclear forces in Europe.
   Baker failed to make headway on the issue last week in his own
talks in Moscow. U.S. officials said the Soviets were reluctant to
conclude the accord until they were assured there would be
reductions in German forces, as well.
   But Baker said the administration hoped ``president-to-president
level of discussions can give some new impetus'' to the
negotiations.
   On Tuesday, a senior U.S. official said it would be difficult to
complete the treaty this year because of the German issue and also
because of Soviet concerns about the steadfastness of the East
European allies.
   At a White House news conference today, Baker said the treaty
being negotiated by NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna would
``change the map of Europe.''
   Baker said it was up to Germans to decide ``the internal
aspects'' of the unification of East Germany with West Germany. On
troop levels, Baker said outsiders could get involved in the
discussions, but here, too, the Germans were in charge of their
future.
   Apart from Soviet concerns about Germany and the Warsaw Pact,
the treaty also is lagging over differences about some of the
weapons to be reduced and about anti-cheating provisions.
   Baker said the main sticking point is a dispute over which
aircraft to limit. He also stressed the importance of verification.
``At stake is the destruction of tens of thousands of pieces of
Soviet military equipment,'' he said.
   On Lithuania, where the Soviets have imposed a partial economic
boycott to deter an independence drive, Baker said a long-term
improvement in superpower relations depends on ``widening
democratic values throughout Soviet society.''
   Baker said Soviet policies in Lithuania ``may disturb us deeply,
offending our fundamental values.'' But, he said, ``there is too
much at stake ... to dismiss cavalierly the potential for
progress.''
   Also, Baker said the slowdown in conventional arms negotiations
would not deter the Bush administration from completing another
treaty to cut long-range nuclear missiles on both sides.
   ``It is a very good thing for the United States of America,'' he
said, ``so why link it?''

   President Bush should urge Mikhail Gorbachev
to stop arming the Angolan government so peace talks can begin in
an effort to end the 15-year civil war, a spokesman for the
U.S.-armed rebels said Wednesday.
   The rebels want the issue discussed at the Bush-Gorbachev summit
that starts here next week, said Jardo Muekalia, the U.S.
representative of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
or UNITA.
   Muekalia said attempts to start peace talks were at a crucial
juncture and the Soviet position could determine their success. He
called the Soviet attitude ambivalent, with diplomats supporting
peace talks but the army providing the Angolan government with
weapons.
   The Soviet Union's leading African Affairs official, Yuri
Yukalov, was in Lisbon on Tuesday for talks with Portuguese
government officials on the Angolan peace process.
   Yukalov said the Soviets would not halt their supply of arms to
Luanda while fighting continued, and might even increase it if the
United States boosts aid to UNITA, Portugal's Lusa news agency
reported.
   The United States provides UNITA with an estimated $40 million
to $50 million of weapons every year, although the program is
secret and exact figures are not available. U.S. supporters of the
aid argue that the Soviets give Angola's government as much as $600
million or $800 million annually.
   Muekalia said UNITA would require more American weapons because
it had almost exhausted the supply provided in an emergency U.S.
airlift in January.
   Officials of UNITA and of the Luanda government held talks in
Evora, Portugal, last month and will meet again soon, he said.
Muekalia described the talks as exploratory but said there was good
will on both sides.
   He said UNITA agreed at the talks to recognize the legitimacy of
the state and its president but refused to recognize the government
as legitimate, saying only free elections could pick a legal
government.
   However, UNITA appears to have dropped a key demand of
establishing a transitional government composed of representatives
from both sides to arrange elections. UNITA now appears willing to
let the government of Jose Eduardo dos Santos rule until elections
occur.
   The government appears to have dropped its demand that UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi step down, Muekalia said. That demand was one
of the main reasons for the failure of a cease-fire in June.

protested his description of Nazi death camps as ``a detail'' of
history.
   A court in Nanterre ordered Le Pen to pay the equivalent of 18
cents to each organization, as well as $720 to each group to cover
legal fees.
   A hearing on the case took place March 28. Le Pen did not attend
the hearing. But he said afterward the decision was another move in
the ``general offensive against the FN,'' or his National Front.
   Le Pen, 61, caused a scandal during a 1987 radio interview by
calling the Nazi gas chambers a ``detail of World War II history.''
He has denied this and other controversial remarks were evidence of
anti-Semitism.
   The National Front currently holds only one seat in the National
Assembly, but has received about 15 percent support in recent
opinion polls. Its central theme is ``France for the French'' and
it advocates deportation of immigrants.
   Bernard Jouanneau, a lawyer for the groups that lodged the
complaint, hailed the judgment as an important message ``to all of
France and in particular to those who listen to Jean-Marie Le Pen's
messages of hate.''
   Numerous French political and civic leaders have accused Le Pen
of creating an atmosphere of racial intolerance that indirectly led
to the desecration of a Jewish cemetery at Carpentras two weeks
ago. A corpse was mutilated at the cemetery and 34 tombs were
vandalized.
   Today, about 15 people in the southern region of Albi were taken
into police custody for questioning but released later in the day,
reliable sources said, speaking on condition they not be named.
   Several newspapers in southern France published a letter today
claiming responsibility for the desecration in the name of an
unknown Moslem organization. The letter purported to corroborate
similar claims made earlier by telephone. Police have said the
claims are under investigation but there is no indication that are
legitimate.

<HEAD>McCain Pushes Case for Relatives of Soviet Defectors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Soviet defectors want their relatives to
visit the West but Moscow has stonewalled the request, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., said Wednesday.
   McCain said he has asked President Bush to raise the issue with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their May 31-June 3 summit
meeting.
   ``The refusal to grant exit visas to Soviet citizens violates
their human rights and contradicts the principles of human rights
which President Gorbachev has enunciated as Soviet policy,'' McCain
said.
   The relatives of the defectors live in Moscow and have applied
for exit visas to visit the United States. None of the requests
have been granted.
   The four defectors are: Arkady Shevchenko, a former
undersecretary at the United Nations; Stanislav Levchenko and
Victor Sheymov, former KGB officials, and Eugeni Novidov, formerly
with the staff of the International Development of the Central
Committee.

   Lithuania's parliament today offered to suspend
some of the laws it has passed since declaring independence two
months ago, but not the declaration itself, Soviet television
reported.
   The Supreme Council of the Baltic republic passed a resolution
that offers to suspend the laws. The brief report on the TV evening
newscast ``Vremya'' did not detail which legislation was involved.
   The laws passed after the March 11 declaration include those
governing Lithuanian participation in the Soviet army draft.
   Earlier today, Lithuania's president today encouraged countrymen
suffering under the Kremlin's 5-week-old economic embargo to
``survive as though we were in a surrounded fortress.''
   ``We are poor, but we'll not starve to death,'' President
Vytautas Landsbergis said in a speech reported by the Lithuanian
news agency ELTA. ``Our main weapon is unity and stamina.''
   Before today's announcement, the Baltic situation was settling
into a stalemate as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev insisted
that Lithuania and its sister republics of Latvia and Estonia
retreat from independence.
   
   Landsbergis and other Baltic leaders have said they are willing
to compromise but will not surrender their goal of seceding from
the Soviet Union, which forcibly annexed all three republics in
1940.
   Gorbachev responded to Lithuania's declaration of independence
by cutting off oil, natural gas and key raw materials. Since energy
supplies were cut off April 18, factories have ground to a halt,
traffic has thinned out and 19,000 people have been thrown out of
work.
   Soviet authorities have blocked hard currency transfers to all
three Baltic republics, but otherwise have not used economic
punishments against Latvia and Estonia for their more cautious
approach to secession.
   Non-Estonian workers were striking at 21 enterprises in Tallinn,
the capital, to protest the republic's secession drive. The
Estonian government responded by trying to block food shipments to
the strikers, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia reported.
   The strikes appeared to have little popular support.
   In Lithuania, Landsbergis said the Soviet blockade was
``strangling'' the republic, and Radio Vilnius reported that over
one-quarter of all industry was idle at some point during the
working day because of the shortage of energy or other supplies.
   The report, monitored in London, cited official figures that
11,000 industrial and 8,000 agricultural workers were unemployed
because of the blockade. The sanctions have cost the republic $75
million, the report said.
   Beginning today, Lithuania said private motorists will no longer
be able to buy gasoline. Gas will be reserved for ambulances,
police cars, fire trucks, food trucks, armored cars, hearses and
agricultural equipment, said Algirdas Brazauskas, head of
Lithuania's anti-blockade committee.
   Landsbergis told a news conference in Vilnius that ``it is
unlikely that the U.S.S.R. will lift the blockade,'' ELTA reported.
   ``The Kremlin's aim is to cause riots in Lithuania and make the
republic surrender,'' he said. ``But Lithuania will not capitulate.
Our strategic task is to prepare the public so that we could
survive as though we were in a surrounded fortress.''
   Gorbachev met Tuesday with the presidents of Latvia and Estonia,
but did not budge from his hard line against their independence.
   Gorbachev, who sat down last week with Lithuania's prime
minister, met at the Kremlin for 20 minutes with presidents Anatoly
Gorbunov of Latvia and Arnold Ruutel of Estonia, the Estonian News
Service reported.
   Gorbachev reportedly told them the same thing he told Lithuanian
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene: the Baltic republics must
either suspend or revoke their declarations of independence, which
violate the Soviet Constitution.

   A congressman on Wednesday criticized the
Pentagon's refusal to release videotapes shot by the military last
December during the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``What is the military secret that has to be protected?'' said
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who has filed a freedom of information
request for release of the tapes.
   In February, Rangel requested the release of all tapes shot by
U.S. forces during the December 20 invasion. But according to the
congressman, the Defense Department has released a portion of the
tapes while withholding tapes shot from Apache helicopters during
the invasion.
   An Army spokesman said the Pentagon has released ``hundreds of
hours of footage,'' but chose not to release the tapes from the
Apache gun camera because it portrays classified military
operations and weapons.
   ``It's not just videotape,'' said Col. Bill Mulvey. ``There are
gun camera dials, distances to targets.''
   In an interview, Rangel said he did not know what the tapes
contained but noted published reports of Panamanians complaining
that missiles fired from the Apache helicopters caused most of the
damage to apartment buildings.
   ``Aren't the American people entitled to know what they
supported?'' said Rangel, the chairman of the House Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   The United States launched the invasion to remove Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who faces a range of U.S. drug
charges, and help install a democratic government.
   In a statement, Rangel said release of the tapes to answer the
``nagging questions about the conduct of the invasion by actually
showing what happened would be more in the interest of the national
security than blocking the public's ability to judge for itself.''

   Canadian truckers upset over competition from
U.S. drivers blocked commercial border crossings today, causing
miles-long backups of big rigs.
   One blockade closed commercial lanes on the Ambassador Bridge
leading into Detroit from Windsor, Ontario, and trucks backed up
five miles into Canada. Parked big rigs blocked commercial traffic
in both directions at another important border crossing, the Blue
Water Bridge at Port Huron.
   Car traffic wasn't impeded.
   A third big crossing, at Sault Ste. Marie, remained clear, said
Mel Hendrickson, U.S. Customs supervisor there.
   The action began Tuesday at crossings between Quebec and New
York state, and spread to Ontario today. The Quebec blockades were
lifted.
   The Canadians say American truckers bring in goods from the
United States, then slash their rates to grab U.S.-bound Canadian
business so they won't have to drive home empty. The Canadian
truckers said such practices force them to work 80-hour weeks and
cut their own wages.
   They also are upset over alleged lax enforcement of their
country's trucking regulations on U.S. truckers. And they complain
that a U.S.-Canada free trade agreement signed last year hurts
Canadians because their industries are overwhelmed by competition
from their more powerful neighbor.
   At the Ambassador Bridge, truckers parked their rigs in front of
trucking lanes and walked away, stranding those behind them.
   ``I'm just a truck driver with a family. I'm 42 years old and
I've been driving a truck for 20 years now, and I don't know
anything else, but we can't compete with American drivers,'' said
Wayne Whitney of Windsor, an organizer of the blockade.
   In Quebec, blockades called by the Quebec Independent Truckers'
Association were lifted after provincial Transport Minister Sam
Elkas agreed Tuesday to tighten controls on truckers from outside
the province.
   But at least 200 Ontario truckers said they would continue
blocking trucks trying to reach the United States.
   ``We'll stay here for as long as it takes until (Ontario
Transportation Minister) Bill Wrye tells us we have a chance to
make a decent paycheck,'' Whitney said.

<HEAD>Silver Fetches $1.9 Million After Century in Vault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four pieces of early 18th-century silver that lay
unclaimed in a bank vault for 101 years were sold for nearly $2
million Wednesday, Christie's said.
   The silver belonged to Thomas Wentworth, 3rd earl of Strafford,
a distinguished soldier and diplomat who died in 1739. The maker
was David Willaume, a French Huguenot and one of the three top
silversmiths in London in his day.
   The Wentworth silver _ a pair of wine bucket, an ewer, and a
basin _ was deposited at Glyn, Mills and Co.'s bank on London's
Lombard Street in 1859 by a descendant who died soon afterward, as
did his executor.
   ``The bank tried to trace other descendants but found none, and
the silver remained in the vault until 1960 when a family
descendant claimed it and sold some pieces in 1963,'' said
auctioneer Stephen Clarke. ``The four pieces now sold were sent by
a descendant of that claimant,'' he said.
   He said an unidentified telephone bidder paid $1.3 million for
the wine buckets. The London dealers Armitage paid $632,000 for the
other pieces.
   ``The silver had gone black when it came out of the vault in
1960, but we have kept an eye on it since then and it is in
splendid condition,'' Clarke said.
   The record price for any piece of silver is $1.98 million paid
at Christie's in New York last month for a 17th-century Sicilian
table fountain.

   The Senate voted 52-48 today to restrict the
import and manufacture of semiautomatic assault weapons, handing a
surprising defeat to the National Rifle Association.
   ``These are combat weapons,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
said shortly before the vote to bar imports of five foreign-made
assault weapons and ban domestic manufacture of four others.
   The vote came as lawmakers worked on a larger anti-crime bill
that also includes provisions to restore capital punishment for 30
federal crimes, including presidential assassination.
   Opponents of the restrictions immediately called for
reconsideration of the decision. But the Senate voted 50-49 not to
reconsider.
   The first vote on semiautomatic weapons came on a move by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to strip from the legislation the restrictions
on nine different types of weapons. The outcome represented a
stunning setback for the National Rifle Association, which had
lobbied hard to kill the curbs. Supporters of the ban had said over
the weekend they held little hope of winning.
   They said they expected to face opposition on the campaign trail
this fall because of the legislation.
   Senate critics called for tougher criminal penalties in place of
curbs on guns.
   ``Let's try 'em and fry 'em,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., told
the Senate Tuesday night. ``That will start a lot of action in the
United States and we won't have to worry about this stuff.''
   DeConcini, the chief sponsor of the restrictions, scoffed at
claims that they would place a burden on the hunters. He pointed to
a picture of a Street Sweeper, a sinister-looking, round-drummed
semiautomatic shotgun of African origin that he called ``an
apartheid control weapon.''
   ``Its not going to be used on deer because it would absolutely
blow the deer to pieces,'' DeConcini said. But Hatch told the
Senate that ``there is nothing in the Constitution that limits the
2nd Amendment to ownership of guns for hunting.''
   There is no legislation in the House at present corresponding to
the Senate crime bill.
   The bill would ban the import of five types of semiautomatic
assault weapons and outlaw the manufacture of four others in this
country.
   Other provisions would restore capital punishment for 30 federal
crimes including presidential assassination. The measure would
overhaul the way courts review the constitutionality of criminal
trials.
   It would allow use of evidence gathered with flawed warrants and
fine tune the money-laundering laws. It also would allow death row
inmates to use statistics to prove claims that their sentences were
the result of racial bias.
   A campaign for curbs on assault weapons began in January 1989
after a deranged gunman with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle
opened fire on a Stockton, Calif., school yard at recess time,
leaving five children dead and 30 others wounded.
   The Senate held its first vote on the issue Tuesday, killing
82-17 an attempt by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to enlarge the
list of banned weapons from nine to 21. Two Republicans joined 15
Democrats in the futile attempt to keep the measure alive.
   Metzenbaum sought to assure lawmakers that they could weather
criticism from the National Rifle Association.
   ``Let us show some courage here today,'' he said. ``Let us stand
up to the National Rifle Association and stand up with the police
officers of this country.''
   ``I know the political liability, it is no secret that some of
the people on my staff are urging me ... not to vote for this,''
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said at another point. But he added:
``We're not going to be around here forever and we ought to be
thinking about what we can contribute.''
   ``We face the choice of siding with the gun lobby or the law
enforcement people and, my friends, in that choice I'm going to
stick with the law enforcement people,'' Simon added.
   Police group representatives earlier urged the Senate to approve
the ban.
   ``The NRA ... has almost completely alienated law enforcement.
We're not divorced, but we're estranged,'' said Baltimore police
Col. L.J. Suspenski. He said he had resigned from the NRA because
of its position on the legislation.
   The bill initially was part of the Bush administration's
anti-crime package, but has long since been reshaped by majority
Democrats led by Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
D-Del. The administration now opposes the measure.
   The plan would ban the import of these weapons:
   _Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashikovs.
   _Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil.
   _Beratta AR-70 (SC-70).
   _Fabrique Nationale FN-FAL, FN-LAR and FNC.
   _Steyr AUG.
   And it called for a prohibition on domestic manufacture of these:
   _INTRATEC TEC-9.
   _Street Sweeper-Striker 12.
   _Colt AR-15 and CAR-15.
   _MAC 10 and MAC 11.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today that China's human rights record ``should not be the only
factor'' in a decision to extend trade benefits for that country.
   Some members of Congress say Bush faces a heated battle if, as
expected, the administration announces Thursday a decision to
extend the benefits.
   While stopping short of actually announcing Bush's decision,
Baker listed reasons at a White House news conference why the
preferential trade status should be extended.
   ``The real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you
terminate it,'' Baker said.
   He said withdrawing the benefits would have a negative impact
among ``reformers in the Chinese government,'' would damage the
economy of Hong Kong and would hurt ``very significant and
substantial'' U.S. economic interests in China.
   Baker said China's human rights record in the aftermath of the
bloody crackdown June 4, 1989, on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square was ``one of the factors'' but ``it should not be
the only factor'' in the decision.
   Despite the threat of a confrontation with Congress, senior
administration officials said Bush would propose a one-year
extension of the most-favored-nation preferential tariff treatment
for China.
   Bush solicited comments from Republican leaders Tuesday. He was
contacting Democrats by telephone today, said White House deputy
press secretary Alixe Glen.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has opposed
giving more trade benefits to China and has urged Bush to overhaul
U.S. policy toward China.
   ``By its actions, the Bush administration is sowing the seeds of
disaster with respect to the next generation of leaders in China,''
Mitchell said.
   ``Like other despots before them, the Chinese government of
today will pass from the scene in time. The question and the
challenge for the Senate is whether we will continue to support a
regime which caused the deaths of many of their own people,'' he
said.
   Mitchell narrowly lost a congressional fight with Bush earlier
this year over legislation dealing with Chinese visas.
   One key House Democrat, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., criticized
Bush for failing to build a consensus on China policy.
   Solarz is chairman of a House subcommittee on Asia, which
canceled a planned hearing today to explore China's trade status
with Richard Solomon, an assistant secretary of State. Solarz'
office said the administration asked for a postponement of the
hearing because it was not ready to testify on the issue.
   Meanwhile, congressional aides said Bush was expected to make
his decision on the matter public Thursday.
   If the trade issue ``is not handled in an appropriate way, it
will set the stage for what will be, I think, a very divisive
debate here in the Congress, not on a partisan basis by the way,''
he said.
   Solarz said he is not opposed to extending most-favored-nation
status, but he wants Bush to put attach strings to the extension.
Administration officials say ``some conditions'' will be included
in Bush's trade extension as a way of expressing displeasure over
China's human rights.
   Most-favored-nation status gives China the same trade benefits,
including lowest-possible tariffs, that the United States extends
to most of its major trading partners.
   Cancellation of the benefits would cause tariffs to rise sharply
on some $12 billion in annual Chinese exports.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a supporter of China's students in
the United States, said she wouldn't vote for most-favored-nation
status for China.
   Her main concern, however, is the $450 million in loans the
World Bank is scheduled to consider later this month. Mrs. Pelosi
would like the United States to block the loans.
   Several Republicans, including House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill., said they would go along with Bush's apparent
attempt to extend trade benefits.
   But the sentiment was not unanimous.
   ``I know the president thinks he has good reason _ American
business interests,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., chairman
of the Republican Policy Committee. ``But I'm bothered by the idea
of granting special treatment'' to China, he said.
   Edwards said China has ``cracked down more, not less'' on human
rights since Tiananmen Square.
   Edwards predicted Bush could probably win a congressional fight
on China.
   Congress could block Bush's decision, but only by passing a
``resolution of disapproval.'' That, in turn, could be vetoed. And
it takes two-thirds votes in both houses to override a veto.
   By a single vote in January, the Senate sustained Bush's veto of
a bill to extend the visas of Chinese students in the United
States. Bush argued that he was offering the Chinese students the
same safe haven through administrative actions.
   On Tuesday, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and
Scholars asked Bush to suspend China's most-favored-nation status
to demonstrate U.S. ``commitment to democracy and human rights in
China.''
   The federation says it represents some 40,000 students at more
than 200 universities in the United States.

   NATO defense ministers today called for
a quick East-West accord to slash troops, tanks and other
non-nuclear arms in Europe to wipe out the chances of a surprise
attack by the Soviet Union.
   ``We appeal to the Soviet Union to show a constructive
attitude,'' said NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner at the end
of two days of talks by defense ministers of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization members.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney joined his counterparts in
the Western alliance by urging the Kremlin to speed up progress on
negotiating a conventional arms agreement this year.
   ``The ball is in their court. ... We are eager to negotiate such
an agreement,'' Cheney said.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today
that President Bush will press Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at their summit meeting May 31-June 3 to revive
negotiations to remove tens of thousands of troops and tanks from
Europe. Baker said it is important that a treaty be signed this
year to cut U.S. and Soviet non-nuclear forces in Europe.
   Western officials have complained in recent weeks of Soviet
foot-dragging at the Vienna talks between negotiators of the 16
NATO nations and the seven of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   The NATO defense chiefs said in a final statement that an
accord, along with other security measures, ``will virtually
eliminate the possibility of a surprise attack on NATO as a whole
by vastly superior conventional forces.''
   ``As a result, the minimum warning time for any large-scale
offensive operation will substantially increase,'' the statement
said.
   The officials said they also decided to ``lower the readiness
and availability'' of some of their forces.
   Cheney said that with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, ``it's
not unreasonable for us to think ... that we would not have to
maintain the same high state of readiness that we have in the
past.''
   The ministers noted they have already reduced the number of
military exercises for their soldiers and planned to make ``further
substantial reductions'' in the training programs.
   Many of these exercises are conducted in West Germany, and
residents have grown increasingly tired of having their lands
overrun by tanks and being subjected to noise from low-level
flights.
   The ministers, as expected, called for a review of their own
military strategy in light of the dramatically reduced East-West
tensions. They also asked military authorities to look into forming
multinational forces, drawing soldiers from the different NATO
nations to create joint divisions.
   No deadline was set for NATO analysts to come up with a report.
   President Bush has urged that the summit participants launch a
``wide-ranging NATO strategy review for the transformed Europe of
the 1990s.''
   The ministers confirmed they have scrapped a guideline, in
effect since the late 1970s, calling for a 3 percent annual
increase in defense spending by each alliance nation. The target,
they said, was ``no longer appropriate.''
   Many nations have failed in recent years to reach that goal, and
even fewer are likely to meet it now.
   British Defense Secretary Tom King on Tuesday raised the
possibility that an East-West deal to cut forces in Europe would
not be reached this year, which would be a serious setback to
Western hopes for rapid arms control deals.
   The two sides are still trying to agree on a ceiling for combat
aircraft and on measures to verify compliance once a treaty is
reached.
   The United States currently has 305,000 troops in Europe, while
the Soviets have an estimated 565,000 soldiers.
   Moscow and Washington have settled on a plan to trim their
forces to 195,000 for each side in Central Europe, with the United
States retaining an additional 30,000 in Britain and southern
Europe.
   The NATO alliance is under pressure to respond to the momentous
changes in Eastern Europe by emphasizing its role as a political
organization rather than a military pact.
   It is battling some calls in Europe that it and the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact be scrapped and replaced by an umbrella security
organization. That organization would be formed from the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation forum for
discussions on human rights and other issues.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev attacked
maverick Communist Boris Yeltsin's campaign platform for the
Russian presidency on Wednesday, accusing him of working toward
``the breakup of the Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev launched the quick, sharp attack on Yeltsin at the
Russian Congress, which he has attended as a silent observer over
the past week. His speech exposed the deep concern that led him to
sit through hours of tedious procedural debates.
   Yeltsin's plan for wresting control of the Russian republic from
the Kremlin and allowing it to set its own policies amounts to ``an
attempt to cut Russia off from socialism,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``That will contradict the line of perestroika, which we
proposed to give a second wind to socialism on the road to
democratization,'' he said. ``Can we do without Russia, if she
decides to go another route?''
   Russia is the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, with just over
half the country's population and two-thirds of its territory.
   In Russia's second-largest city, Leningrad, outspoken reformer
Anatoly Sobchak was elected mayor Wednesday, the official Soviet
news agency Tass reported. Sobchak is a lawyer and member of the
national legislature who has frequently clashed with Soviet
authorities. He received 223 votes out of 320 in the Leningrad
Council of People's Deputies, the local parliament. He faced two
opponents.
   Gavrill Popov, the mayor of Moscow, the country's largest city,
is also an outspoken reformer and member of the same opposition
group as Sobchak.
   The Russian Congress is expected to end discussions on
sovereignty on Thursday and turn to nominations for president. The
president is chosen by the 1,059-member Congress rather than in
general elections. The current president is Vitaly Vorotnikov.
   Yeltsin, a populist who won the backing of millions with his
calls to speed reforms and do away with privileges for the elite,
is the only contender for the presidency who has announced his
candidacy. He has said he expects to face Alexander Vlasov, the
current premier of Russia, and cannot predict whether he will win.
   Yeltsin's speech Tuesday on Russian sovereignty proposed
economic independence for the vast republic and said it should have
the final say over whether Soviet laws and decrees were valid on
its territory.
   ``A serious analysis shows what he suggests under the banner of
restoration of Russia's sovereignty means a call to the breakup of
the Soviet Union,'' Gorbachev charged.
   Some observers at the Congress suggested Gorbachev's overt
intervention in the race for president _ which could be seen as
inappropriate because he is not even a member of the Congress _
would backfire and cause more deputies to vote for Yeltsin. Others
said his main goal had been to get across to obedient deputies
their duty to vote against Yeltsin, and in that he surely succeeded.
   The Congress was generally raucous, with a major disruption in
the morning and loud heckling during Gorbachev's speech.
   In the morning, deputies shouted ``Shame! Shame!'' and jeered a
monarchist colleague who erected a small red-white-and-blue flag,
the symbol of czarist Russia, on his desk. He was forced to remove
it.
   When Gorbachev was speaking, hecklers led him to retort:
``You're active, but I've met up with more active people.''
   He accused Yeltsin of being ``confrontational,'' and appealed
for greater harmony to allow reforms to move forward.
   Yeltsin was Gorbachev's protege at one point, but in the past
two years has become his most vocal public critic. Gorbachev has
rarely responded to Yeltsin's criticism with direct
counter-attacks, but he has complained several times of radical
``demagogues'' who care more about their own ambitions than the
good of the people.

   Hundreds of Cuban-Americans who came to
Washington to celebrate Cuban Independence Day with President Bush
went home disappointed after the White House canceled the outdoor
ceremony due to the threat of rain.
   But several hundred others who showed up anyway at the White
House gates Tuesday were treated to a tour of the mansion and an
East Room rally where Bush made a surprise appearance.
   The standing-room-only crowd of 350 gave Bush a tumultuous
welcome as he strode into the East Room just as Vice President Dan
Quayle finished a speech denouncing Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   Bush called Cuba the only ``holdout against democracy and
freedom'' in this hemisphere.
   ``I am convinced in my own heart that it will not be very long
before Cuba is totally democratic and free,'' he told the exiles
and their families.
   ``We are going to keep broadcasting the truth to Cuba,'' Bush
said of his TV Marti broadcasts to the island, which Castro has
jammed. ``We will keep the pressure on.''
   Quayle said he hoped ``next year we will celebrate Cuban
independence in Havana.''
   David Demarest, who decided to cancel the event, said Wednesday
that it probably was the right decision.
   Demarest, White House communications director, estimated a
couple of hundred other Cuban-Americans came from Miami and other
distant places and never got into the White House.
   Although it poured Tuesday morning and was raining as late as 1
p.m., the sun was shining when Bush spoke at 2:25 p.m.
   Demarest said 1,900 guests were expected on the South Lawn,
which was ``soup'' when he decided at 8 a.m. to cancel the event.
   ``The tickets all say it's canceled in case of inclement
weather,'' he said. ``We sent some people to the Miami airport to
try to notify people.''
   But hundreds still came by plane and by bus from New York, New
Jersey and elsewhere.
   Demarest hastily arranged the East Room rally, where the
visitors sang the Cuban national anthen and heard from Cuban-born
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., Andrew Card, the deputy White
House chief of staff, and William Price, a National Security
Council Latin expert.
   Then Bush showed up with John Sununu, his Havana-born chief of
staff. Demarest said it was impromptu.
   Bush has held Rose Garden events in the rain, including greeting
the University of Miami Hurricanes football team after they won the
national championship.
   Jacqueline Tillman, executive director of the Cuban American
National Foundation, said some members of her organization were
disappointed.
   ``The lesson is if you're going to do it outdors in Washington
in May, when it rains a lot, you need to have a backup plan,'' she
said.
   But Demarest said it would cost money to hire Constitution Hall
or other alternative sites.
   ``We don't have a budget for things like that,'' he said.
   ``We will follow up. We'd like to do a large Cuban-American
event probably in Miami at some point in the future,'' Demarest
said.

   The three types of U.S. nuclear munitions that
reportedly have been modified for safety reasons or are undergoing
review are designed to be fired from field artillery, submarines
and bombers.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney acknowledged in Brussels, Belgium,
on Wednesday that officials found in 1988 that W-79 howitzer
shells, currently deployed in Europe, did not meet minimum safety
standards.
   He said the problem was corrected and there was never any risk
of an accidental nuclear explosion.
   Cheney commented on a report in Wednesday's editions of The
Washington Post, which also said the W-88 warhead atop the new D-5
missile being deployed on Trident submarines this year would be
reviewed by a special committee.
   The newspaper said flight restrictions had been instituted
pending review of the W-69 warhead on the short-range SRAM-A
missile carried by some bombing aircraft.
   The W-79 warhead goes on an 8-inch Army artillery shell and is
designed to explode in battle with a nuclear yield of up to 10
kilotons. That is about two-thirds the force of the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
   The Trident missiles are designed to be launched from Navy
submarines at sea. Their mission, the Pentagon says, is to deter a
nuclear attack by assuring U.S. ability to retaliate.
   SRAM, or short-range attack, missiles are supersonic,
air-to-ground nuclear weapons designed to be slung below the wings
of B-52, B-1B or FB-111 bombers or carried in the internal bomb
bay, the Post reported. The Pentagon has said such missiles are
designed to enable the Air Force to strike defended targets without
flying directly over them.
   The Post said the yield of the W-88 is 475 kilotons and that of
the W-69 is 1,100 kilotons.

<HEAD>Doe Acknowledges Loss to Rebels of Major Port City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Samuel Doe's government
acknowledged Wednesday that rebels have captured the country's main
port but said it would send forces to retake the city.
   Acting Information Minister Moses Washington told a news
conference soldiers will make ``gradual moves to recapture'' the
Atlantic port of Buchanan to minimize casualties.
   Rebels of the National Patriotic Front led by Charles Taylor, a
former Doe aide, invaded Liberia from its northeastern border with
Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. Doe's troops have been unable to halt their
advance.
   The capture of Buchanan, 88 miles from the capital, was a major
victory for the rebels. It is the country's main port and exit
point for iron ore, which earned more than 70 percent of the
country's foreign currency. The mine itself, in northern Nimba
County, was captured by rebels last week.
   Doe, meanwhile, ordered the military and police to set up a
special team to track down the killers of 10 men found beheaded in
the capital Monday and Tuesday.
   Doe, noting reports the victims were members of tribes that
support the rebels, said the government ``will not encourage,
condone or resort to sectional killings of peaceful citizens.''
   His information minister said the killings were being
perpetrated by people ``determined to stir up further trouble by
doing strange things to embarrass the government.''
   Police said only one of the bodies had been identified, as Sgt.
Y.S. Grabia of the Liberian army.
   Local newspapers quoted Grabia's wife as saying he was arrested
at their home Sunday night with some other men. The newspapers did
not identify the woman by name or say whether they knew the fate of
the others.
   A diplomatic source in Monrovia, reached by telephone from
Abidjan, Ivory Coast, said the killings were tribal murders related
to the rebels' attempt to overthrow Doe.
   ``There are rumors of a lot more of such killings going on, and
fears that this is just the beginning,'' said the diplomat on
condition of anonymity.
   The bodies were found ``dumped around the city,'' the diplomat
said, adding all those killed were government soldiers from the Gio
and Mano tribes to which many rebels belong.
   International human rights organizations and survivors accuse
Doe's troops of massacring hundreds of Gio and Mano civilians in
the battle against insurgents. The rebels are accused of killing
civilians of the Mandingo and Krahn tribes, to which Doe and many
of his officers belong.
   Taylor has accused Doe's government of corruption and bringing
ruin to this West African nation, which was founded by freed
American slaves in 1847. He calls himself a capitalist.
   Doe seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted the
descendants of the slaves, who discriminated against indigenous
groups.

<HEAD>NATO Wants to Reduce Readiness of Soldiers in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense chiefs said Wednesday the
Soviet military threat has declined so much they can begin reducing
the readiness of their soldiers to fight a war in Europe.
   Defense ministers of the North Atlanic Treaty Organization ended
two days of talks by setting in motion a wide-ranging study of the
military strategy that guided the Western alliance during the Cold
War years.
   ``Today's meeting signifies an important step toward a new
security relationship in Europe,'' NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner said.
   Among the changes to be studied are less emphasis on troop
readiness and cuts in availability, the defense ministers said in a
final statement. More emphasis will be placed on reserve forces,
they said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that with the unraveling of
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, ``we can afford to change the current
status of our forces.''
   ``These are drastic changes,'' said Gen. Klaus Naumann, security
adviser to Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg of West Germany.
   NATO leaders will meet in London in early July to formally
launch the overall review of alliance policy. NATO is under
pressure to respond to the momentous changes in Eastern Europe by
emphasizing its role as a political organization rather than a
military pact.
   In their statement, the defense ministers also appealed to the
Kremlin to speed progress so that agreement can be reached this
year on slashing troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   ``The ball is in their court. ... We are eager to negotiate such
an agreement,'' said Cheney.
   Western officials in recent weeks have accused the Soviets of
foot-dragging at talks in Vienna between negotiators of the 16 NATO
nations and the seven Warsaw Pact countries.
   Moscow and Washington have settled on a plan to trim their
forces to 195,000 for each side in Central Europe, with the United
States retaining an additional 30,000 in Britain and southern
Europe. The United States currently has 305,000 troops in Europe,
while the Soviets have an estimated 565,000.
   Still unresolved are reductions in combat aircraft and measures
to ensure compliance with an eventual accord.
   In Washington on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker II
said President Bush will press Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to revive the Vienna negotiations when the leaders meet
at the May 31-June 3 summit.
   The ministers' statement said an accord on troop reduction,
coupled with other security measures, would ``virtually eliminate
the possibility of a surprise attack on NATO as a whole by vastly
superior conventional forces.''
   ``As a result, the minimum warning time for any large-scale
offensive operation will substantially increase,'' the statement
said.
   Cheney said later the warning period has been moved from a few
days to ``at least a few months.'' Consequently, U.S. officials
said readiness time for some NATO units will be lengthened on July
1.
   ``A (helicopter) unit, which is now supposed ... to be ready to
go within four hours of the gun going off, now has 48 hours,'' said
Stephen Hadley, assistant defense secretary for international
security policy.
   Cheney said earlier the United States could now also consider
revising its readiness time to send troops to Europe to fend off an
attack.
   Currently, the United States must be prepared to deploy 10
divisions of soldiers within 10 days. In the future, he suggested
reserve units might be given a few months to get ready.
   The ministers also said they would make more cuts in military
exercises and training programs, some of which can be replaced with
computer simulations.
   ``This will reduce the impact on the public, will benefit the
quality of life and protect the environment,'' the statement said.
   Many of NATO's war games take place in Germany, where residents
are fed up with tanks rolling down their highways and military
aircraft flying low over their houses.

<HEAD>AFO-CIO Plans Campaign for National Health Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO will launch a $4 million
television campaign in an effort to rally support for a national
health care program, union president Lane Kirkland said Wednesday.
   The 14.2 million-member federation also plans to hold summer
hearings around the country to explore options for containing
health care costs that have been rising by 20 percent a year,
Kirkland said.
   Americans who have health insurance are paying for the 37
million Americans who are uninsured because their employers are
``freeloading on the rest of us,'' Kirkland said. Another 50
million Americans have inadequate insurance, he said.
   ``The AFL-CIO intends to expose the dimension of the nation's
health care crisis for the rest of 1990 and as far into the future
as it takes to get a solution through Congress,'' Kirkland said at
a news conference.
   Last year, organized labor enlisted Polish Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa for its ``Union Yes'' TV blitz aimed at improving the
image of U.S. unions.
   Kirkland said the new round of TV campaigns, which will run this
fall, will be designed to build support among Americans for
national health care legislation.
   Labor wants to ``spread the net of support as wide as we can,''
Kirkland said, including soliciting business' help.
   ``To those who believe this crisis doesn't affect them, we say
you are wrong. ... If you think it's only your neighbor's problem,
just wait until tomorrow,'' Kirkland said.
   In the past, the AFL-CIO has backed legislation to require
private employers to provide private health insurance to workers.
   However, at the federation's executive council meeting in
February, labor leaders didn't back a specific proposal and instead
said they were committed to finding a solution as long as it was
fair, affordable and provided access for all Americans.
   ``We are in a negotiating mode,'' Kirkland said.
   On another matter, Kirkland said a special panel studying
whether labor should take a stand on abortion expected to have a
recommendation by August.
   The president of Planned Parenthood and a high-ranking official
of the Roman Catholic Church will meet with labor leaders in July,
Kirkland said.
   Women union members have been pressing the AFL-CIO _
traditionally led by older men _ to back abortion rights for women.
Anti-abortion groups have urged the federation to stay out of the
controversy, saying a pro-choice stand would cost the AFL-CIO
membership.

<HEAD>Coalition Seeks Alternative To Federal Transportation Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groups critical of the government's new
transportation policy laid out their own plan Wednesday, calling
for more support for mass transit and pedal power and less reliance
on autos and airplanes.
   Harriet Parcells of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers said 27 organizations and several members of Congress
support the plan.
   ``U.S. transportation policy neglects clean, energy-efficient
alternatives to driving alone and jeopardizes not only our mobility
but the health of our environment, economy and our cities and U.S.
energy security,'' Parcells told a news conference on the Capitol
lawn.
   Several speakers from environmental, consumer and labor groups
attacked the National Transportation Policy announced by the
government in February. The federal policy covers most of the
concerns the groups cited but puts more emphasis on state and local
funding and decision-making.
   ``The federal government can't just stand back and referee from
the sidelines,'' Parcells said.
   Announcing the Campaign for New Transportation Priorities, the
groups outlined eight goals: preserve the existing infrastructure,
reduce congestion, enhance energy security, protect the
environment, improve safety, curtail auto and truck subsidies,
create liveable communities, and promote new research.
   Ms. Parcells said the group has no estimate of the overall cost
of its proposals but said money would be provided primarily by
diverting funding from federal programs that will lead to more
pollution and energy waste.
   Among the coalition's specific proposals are:
   _Increase funding to repair aging railroad tracks and rail cars.
   _Fund and encourage high-occupancy vehicle programs, bicycle
paths and pedestrian walkways, high-speed rail and peak-hour
pricing at airports.
   _Increase auto fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks.
   _Boost funding for Amtrak and other alternatives to cars and
planes.
   _Eliminate policies that favor heavy trucks over freight
railroads.
   _Increase the federal gas tax, impose congestion fees on auto
commuters, and provide tax benefits for non-auto commuters.
   _Preserve open spaces in urban areas and keep railroad rights of
ways under federal control.
   _Pass laws to reduce the number of billboards.

   The umbrella organization of Jews in the
Soviet Union has asked President Bush to press Mikhail Gorbachev at
next week's summit over ``his decision to keep silence on the
problem of growing Nazism in his own country.''
   A letter to Bush from the Vaad, a confederation of Soviet Jewish
communities, accused Gorbachev of ``connivance ... toward this
great danger.''
   Secretary of State James Baker, describing the summit agenda on
Wednesday, said Bush would raise the issue of anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union.
   The May 20 letter from Vaad, a copy of which was obtained by a
reporter Wednesday, said ``We feel the time has come to persuade
the Soviet government and President Gorbachev that they cannot join
the family of civilized nations ... carrying anti-Semitism in their
luggage.
   It described the revived neo-Nazi ideology of Pamyat, a popular
movement which has flourished under Gorbachev's liberalized
domestic policies.
   ``... Soviet Nazis comprise different groups united by
xenophobia and the search for a scapegoat'' for the Soviet Union's
problems, the letter said.
   ``All these groups are involved into mass incitement of the
hatred towards the Jews, ... preparation for mass physical
violence, desecration of Jewish sanctuaries,'' the letter said.
   A recent State Department report found that anti-Semitism of the
type described in the letter has spread over the past few years as
barriers on free expression have been lifted.
   Growing anti-Semitism has resulted in massive Jewish emigration,
made possible by a significant easing of previous restrictions on
leaving the Soviet Union.
   But Baker said a debate scheduled next week in the Supreme
Soviet on a package of emigration laws had been postponed, raising
doubts about the signing of a trade agreement at the Bush-Gorbachev
summit. The United States has made passage of the emigration laws a
precondition for granting the Soviets trade concessions.

   Marla Maples, the Other Woman of Donald Trump
fame, came out of ``hiding'' Wednesday, showing off her brand new
jeans and smiling sweetly for photographers.
   ``I'm kind of easing my way back in'' to a normal life, the
26-year-old Maples said after a news conference introducing her as
the new spokeswoman for No Excuses jeans.
   Maples, a model and actress, refused to discuss her relationship
with Trump, whatever it may be, saying, ``I don't want to comment
on that. He's still working on his own personal situation.''
   Trump in February separated from his wife, Ivana, of nearly 13
years. Maples found herself in the eye of the Trumpian storm after
she was tagged the ``other woman'' in the billionaire's life.
   Maples said she was on her third callback for a part in a movie
when the Trump deluge began.
   ``It was looking very, very good,'' but because of all the
attention ``I just pulled out. That's when I chose to go into
hiding because I didn't want to get involved.''
   Maples signed a one-year contract with No Excuses for a reported
$500,000.
   Donna Rice, whose alleged affair with Gary Hart forced the
senator from Colorado to drop out of the 1988 presidential race,
was also a spokeswoman for the jeans.

   Prince is used to getting royal
treatment, but one Dutch couple decided to put a stop to the divine
rights of rock stars.
   A Dutch court has ruled in favor of Marcel Soek and Merith
Gijtenbeek, who sued the posh Hotel des Indes for allegedly giving
their VIP suite reservation to the singer.
   The court ordered the hotel to pay a $13,369 penalty unless it
gives the Imperial Suite to the couple for their June 2 wedding
night, the couple and the hotel management said Wednesday.
   The couple booked the suite in March, but ``the hotel told us
after several weeks that the room was going to be given instead to
an American pop star along with 10 other royal suites,'' Soek said.
   ``They didn't tell us who the star was, but the lawyer slipped
the other day in court and said it was Prince,'' Soek said.
   Hotel Des Indes General Manager Bernard Felix said the hotel had
not decided whether to appeal the ruling.

   Another pair of blue eyes will be hitting the
supermarket _ Frank Sinatra has joined Paul Newman in the pasta
sauce business.
   Sinatra unveiled his three varieties of sauce _ Tomato Basil
with Parmesan, Milano Style and Marinara with Mushrooms _ during a
gathering Monday evening at Melrose Avenue's trendy Mortons
restaurant.
   Grocery stores in Nevada and northern California have been
selling the 25-ounce jars for months. The Sinatra sugo da tavola
Italian sauce hit Southern California markets this week.
   ``Our family has always favored simply cooked sauces made with
the freshest ingredients,'' Sinatra said. ``It's a kick having our
sauce in the market and terrific when people tell us how much they
like the taste.''
   Asked what he thought about competing with ``Newman's Own''
pasta sauce, Sinatra says he hopes both companies do well.
   Sinatra said his company shares its profits with charity.

<TEXT>
   Doctors have found billionaire developer Harry
Helmsley unfit to stand trial on state tax fraud charges, a judge
said Wednesday.
   The 81-year-old Helmsley had also been found unfit to stand
trial on federal tax charges after suffering a series of strokes.
   Helmsley was examined by two court-appointed doctors and both
found him to be unfit, said State Supreme Court Justice John
Bradley, a trial level judge.
   Bradley said he will decide whether to hold a hearing on
Helmsley's mental and physical condition after he gets the
physicians' reports.
   Assistant Attorney General Alfredo Mendez asked the judge for
time to study the report and address ``the apparent
inconsistencies, that Mr. Helmsley is not fit to stand trial but is
fit to do other things.''
   A 188-count state indictment charges Helmsley and his wife,
Leona, with tax and business fraud. Most of the counts alleged they
renovated, furnished and operated their estate in Greenwich, Conn.,
while charging the personal expenses to their businesses.
   On May 16, Bradley dismissed 180 of the 188 counts against Mrs.
Helmsley on double jeopardy grounds. Mrs. Helmsley, tried and
convicted in federal court, was sentenced to four years in prison
and fined $7.1 million. She is appealing that conviction.
   All the state counts remain against Helmsley because he was
never tried in federal court.
   Mrs. Helmsley, sobbing as she left court Wednesday, said the
state was proceeding with the case against her husband, despite his
condition, ``because he's Harry Helmsley and they want me.''

   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleburger on Wednesday urged Western allies to provide the
emerging Eastern European democracies with economic gifts, rather
than loans.
   ``Loans would just add to the great debt burden that Eastern
Europe already has,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleburger told an international conference on aid to Eastern
Europe.
   Most of the proposals from other countries have been for loans.
   The United States is committed to $533 million in aid for Poland
and Hungary this year, most of it in form of grants or credit
guarantees.
   President Bush has proposed adding $300 million next year to the
$205 million in assistance already approved for fiscal years 1991
and 1992.
   Eagleburger acknowledged the administration has no overall
blueprint for helping the region.
   ``Anyone who had such a blueprint would have had to change it
several times recently,'' he said.
   Despite his opposition to loans, Eagleburger endorsed the newly
organized European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which
will have $12 billion available for lending to the area.
   He said it would be useful for large-scale projects which would
be too big for any one donor country or small group of countries.
   The United States, one of 24 countries in Western Europe,
America and Asia which set up the new European bank, is expected to
provide about 10 percent of the initial funding for the bank.

<HEAD>Administration Sharply Raises Price Estimate on S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday
dramatically boosted its estimate for rescuing the savings and loan
industry, saying the government will need to borrow between $90
billion and $130 billion to clean up the S&amp;L mess.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in an appearance before
Congress, blamed the slumping real estate market for bloating what
was already the largest government bailout in history.
   It was the first time the administration has acknowledged what
critics have been contending for some time _ that the amount of
money included in last year's massive S&amp;L bailout bill would not be
enough.
   During debate on the legislation last year, the administration
insisted the problem could be largely handled with the $50 billion
in long-term borrowing authority included in the bailout bill.
   Some Democratic critics contended the new estimate showed that
the administration was not moving quickly enough to close sick S&amp;Ls.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called the situation an
``unmitigated disaster'' and warned that without greater
administration attention ``the crisis will get worse.''
   The administration said its more pessimistic projection was
based on a belief that the slumping real estate market means more
S&amp;Ls are likely to fail and the cost of protecting depositors at
the insolvent institutions will be greater.
   Since most of an savings institution's assets are in the form of
loans based on the value of real estate, falling real estate prices
put more borderline institutions into trouble.
   The administration's new cost range assumes that between 722 and
1,032 institutions could fail. During debate on the S&amp;L bailout
bill, the number of threatened institutions was put at around 500.
   The new cost estimate does not include the cost of borrowing the
money over the next 30 years. When that price is included, the
bailout cost is expected to exceed $300 billion.
   The General Accounting Office in April put the bailout cost with
interest payments included at $325 billion, saying that figure
could skyrocket to $500 billion if the economy falters.
   Brady presented the administration's new estimate in testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee. He refused to provide an
estimate of the total pricetag with interest costs included, but he
did not dispute the GAO assumptions.
   Brady said about 90 percent of the administration's higher cost
estimate stemmed from falling real estate prices, especially for
commercial real estate such as office buildings. He said depressed
real estate prices were showing up not only in the Southwest but
also in the Northeast, Southeast and other sections of the country.
   ``We are dealing with a moving target, made greatly more
expensive by a weakening real estate market and constantly changing
economic conditions,'' he said. ``This is a long, hard job and it
will take an extended period of time to finish it.''
   The administration estimated that for just the 1991 fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1, the cost of the S&amp;L bailout will be $61
billion, more than eight times the $7.3 billion called for in the
president's January budget request.
   White House budget director Richard Darman told lawmakers at a
separate hearing that the pricetag of the mushrooming S&amp;L crisis
played a major role in driving the administration to seek budget
negotiations with Congress.
   ``It is extraordinary,'' Darman said. ``The magnitudes are just
very, very much larger than the budget system is prepared to deal
with.''
   Darman said the S&amp;L rescue cost would force automatic spending
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law that could exceed
$100 billion. The cuts could reach 45 to 50 percent in many
domestic programs, he said. The law will trigger spending cuts in
October, the start of fiscal 1991, if the new year's deficit is not
reduced to $74 billion.
   The administration and some members of Congress want to exclude
a portion of the S&amp;L costs from the deficit calculations, a step
that would make it easier to meet the deficit targets in the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   Brady, appearing with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
and other members of the oversight board supervising the S&amp;L
bailout, dodged questions on how the government should raise the
extra money needed to complete the S&amp;L rescue effort.
   He said that issue should be addressed in the budget
negotiations the administration was conducting with Congress.

   A recently isolated chimpanzee virus is more
closely related to the human AIDS virus than other AIDS-related
monkey viruses are, and may be a ``missing link'' between human and
primate versions, scientists say.
   However, the finding does not resolve the question of whether
the AIDS virus originated in humans or in animals, scientists said.
   Analysis of the chimpanzee virus is presented in Thursday's
issue of the British journal Nature by scientists from Gabon and
from the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
   The virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in the West
African nation and isolated from one of them. It is classified as a
lentivirus, the same category that includes HIV-1, which causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the United States.
   Other lentiviruses, called simian immunodeficiency viruses or
SIVs, have been found in four kinds of monkeys: macaques, sooty
mangabeys, African green monkeys and mandrills.
   Analysis of the new virus showed it was the first non-human
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as HIV-1,
the researchers reported. And when the protein products of its
genes were studied, they were more like those of HIV-1 than those
of the simian viruses tested.
   Nonetheless, when compared to the range of known genetic
variants of HIV-1, the chimp virus lay outside that range, the
researchers said.
   They suggested it might be called chimpanzee immunodeficiency
virus.
   Only two of 83 chimps tested in Gabon carried the virus,
indicating it is not widespread there, they reported. And none of
more than 250 chimpanzees caught over the last 15 to 20 years in
West Africa showed evidence of the virus.
   The two chimps in which the virus was found were both infants in
relatively good health. If the virus had made them ill with
anything like AIDS, they probably would not have survived predators
in the jungle, researchers said.
   It is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a
precursor to HIV-1, and even if it were, analysis indicates that it
could not be the immediate precursor, they said.
   But the virus may be a form of ``missing link'' between the
African Old World primate viruses and HIV-1, wrote Ronald
Desrosiers of the New England Regional Primate Research Center in
Southborough, Mass.
   He agreed that the discovery does not settle the question of
whether HIV-1 originated in humans or came from a non-human
ancestor. But further study of the isolate may shed light on it, he
said in a Nature editorial.

<HEAD>Baker Says `Got What We Want' in Pre-Summit Soviet Arms Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Wednesday rejected charges that he gave away too much to the
Soviets in an nuclear arms deal, asserting ``We've got what we
want.'' He also said too much is at stake to allow disputes over
Lithuania to block U.S.-Soviet progress.
   Baker, at a news conference, also revealed a new stumbling block
to the signing of an economic agreement leading toward normal trade
relations with Moscow.
   Baker, previewing next week's summit meeting between President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the Soviet
legislature has again delayed adoption of a law allowing the free
emigration of Soviet Jews and other dissidents.
   Bush has made passage of such a law a condition for giving
Moscow most-favored-nation trade status. Such a trade declaration
would provide the Soviets with the same benefits, including
lowest-possible tariffs, that the United States extends to other
major economic partners.
   The Soviets had been expected to pass the law May 31, but Baker
said the action ``has been postponed somewhat.''
   Since returning Sunday from arms negotiations in Moscow, Baker
has been attacked by conservatives who say the United States,
dealing from a position of strength, made too many concessions to a
weakened Soviet Union. Critics include Richard N. Perle, who served
as assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration.
   Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze resolved
most of the key differences to a treaty cutting long-range nuclear
missiles but did not agree to any limits on modernizing the Soviet
SS-18 heavy missile, the most dangerous weapon in Moscow's arsenal.
   Baker, however, said, ``There is very strong support for this
agreement among the military leadership of the United States ...
support for it as a good agreement that is very much in the
national security interests of the United States.
   ``And it would appear to me at least that most of the criticism
is coming from those who in the past, from time to time, have
simply rejected the concept of arms control generally,'' Baker said.
   Rather than the United States making concessions, Baker said,
``it's been pretty much all the other way around.'' He noted that
Moscow will cut its force of SS-18s in half, and the superpowers
had cut through longstanding differences on air- and sea-launched
cruise missiles.
   ``And we've got what we want,'' Baker said.
   The secretary said Bush will press Gorbachev to revive
negotiations to cut tens of thousands of troops and tanks in
Europe. However, he said there should not be any linkage between a
treaty to cut nuclear weapons and the separate agreement on
conventional forces in Europe.
   Baker said the United States still wants to sign a treaty this
year to reduce the non-nuclear forces. However, he failed to make
progress on the issue in Moscow last week, apparently because the
Soviets want assurances about reductions in German forces after
unification.
   Baker said it was up to Germans to decide ``the internal
aspects'' of the unification of East Germany with West Germany. On
troop levels, Baker said outsiders could get involved in the
discussions, but here, too, the Germans were in charge of their
future.
   Baker said the main obstacle to a conventional force agreement
concerned which aircraft to limit.
   On Lithuania, Baker said the Soviet Union's policies ``may
disturb us deeply, offending our fundamental values. But as the
president has made clear, there is too much at stake in the United
States-Soviet relationship to dismiss cavalierly or imprudently the
potential for progress.''
   ``We must continue the search for points of mutual advantage,''
he said.
   ``We have been saying for quite some time that we see a little
bit of tension in the relationship as a consequence of what's
happening in the Baltics, and we'd very much like to see a peaceful
dialogue resolve that issue,'' he said.

   The government will lay its future on the line in
the Soviet Union's first national referendum, in which voters will
consider a shift to a market economy that could cost tens of
millions of jobs, officials said Wednesday.
   The government believes it must have clear public support before
starting the potentially destabilizing five-year reform plan, First
Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov told a news conference.
   ``If the program is not approved, it is my opinion the
government should resign,'' Maslyukov said, referring to the
Council of Ministers led by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   It was unclear whether the public would endorse the reforms,
which would double food prices Jan. 1, 1991, lead to widespread
closures of inefficient factories, and eventually allow private
ownership of most businesses.
   Ryzhkov was to present the plan Thursday to the Supreme Soviet
parliament, where some radical reformers were planning to seek his
resignation. He survived a similar no-confidence vote last fall.
   No Soviet government has ever fallen because of either a
referendum or a parliamentary vote, although prime ministers have
been forced to resign by the Communist Party leader.
   Even if the government falls, Soviet law guarantees that Mikhail
S. Gorbachev would continue the four-year presidential term to
which he was elected by the Congress of People's Deputies this
year. He is also general secretary of the Communist Party,
traditionally the top Kremlin job.
   But Gorbachev has balked at standing for popular election, and
defeat of the referendum would throw the future wide open,
Maslyukov said.
   ``If the public refuses to consent to the price rises, then
perhaps we will have to resort to round-table discussions,''
Maslyukov said, referring to talks that led to the fall of the
Communist government in Poland last year.
   Soviet reformers are seeking talks to discuss devolving
political and economic decision-making power from central
authorities, where it has resided since the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917.
   The government has been wary of radical reform, however.
Officials rejected proposals for a more abrupt, two-year
Polish-style ``shock therapy,'' fearing public anger. And Soviet
officials have said they do not enjoy the same popularity as
Poland's Solidarity leadership.
   Shock-therapy, which calls for rapid reform to keep the period
of dislocation short, could put 40 million Soviets out of work,
Maslyukov said.
   ``We are unable to offer normal living conditions to such a
number if they lose their jobs. It would the lead the country to
the edge of an economic crash,'' he said.
   Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin told a news conference that even
under the proposed five-year transition, tens of millions of jobs
could be lost.
   The plan calls for rapid conversion of state-owned enterprises
to stock companies, and the gradual sale of their stock to the
public. It would permit certain companies and industries to
contract directly for their supplies and to sell their products in
a free market. Unprofitable firms would go bankrupt.
   The plan sets target price increases for various sectors of the
economy, including an 82 percent rise in energy prices, an average
43 percent rise in retail prices and doubling the price of food,
which is now subsidized.
   Wages and other compensation would rise to match only some of
the price increases, Abalkin said.
   Maslyukov said the Supreme Soviet would set the date for the
referendum, which would be the first in Soviet history.
   The outcome is far from certain, as Soviet people cling to an
ideology that brands individual wealth harmful to the collective
good. Gorbachev has blamed public opinion for retarding reform.
   A recent poll found 54 percent of Soviets favor market reforms
but 46 percent are opposed, said Stanislav Shatalin, the lone
economist on Gorbachev's advisory Presidential Council. The council
approved the reform plan Tuesday.
   Nikolai Petrakov, one of Gorbachev's top economics aides, said
Wednesday he was unhappy with the plan.
   Asked whether announcing price increases seven months before
they take effect would cause a rush on shops and hoarding by
businesses, Petrakov said: ``This will create a panic, an economic
panic.''
   The government discussed radical reforms last fall, but backed
away. The economy has deteriorated sharply since then. In the first
three months of 1990, wages rose 13.4 percent while production
declined. Official figures show that industrial output dropped by
1.2 percent.
   Under the latest proposal, workers are to receive raises,
businesses are to recalculate their books based on new prices, and
the government will discover how many businesses will need
subsidies to continue operating.
   Petrakov said 220,000 state enterprises, or 70 percent of the
total, will be converted to stock-based companies within the next
several months, as a first step toward selling the shares to
individuals, companies and banks.
   Maslyukov said prices on 60 percent of the items sold will
remain controlled. These include prices for raw materials, energy
and products made by the monopoly firms dominating the economy.
   An additional 25 percent of prices will be regulated and 15
percent will float with the market, Maslyukov told the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council.

   The number of men and women in the armed
forces is down slightly from last year, according to figures
released Wednesday by the Pentagon.
   The latest total, for April 30, was 2,063,743 full-time military
personnel, counting both regulars and reserves on active duty and
officer candidates and cadets at the three military academies.
   This was 46,544 fewer than on the same date in 1989. It was also
down 7,347 from the previous month.
   The figures exclude approximately 74,200 full-time military
personnel who are paid from appropriations for reserve components
and Corps of Engineer functions, rather than appropraitions for
active duty military personnel. This group amount to about 72,000
last year.
   The Pentagon described the figures as preliminiary. It gave the
totals for the Army as 745,763, the Navy 581,525, the Marine Corps
195,384 and the Air Force 541,071.

   A court on Wednesday ordered far-right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen to pay a symbolic fine for referring to the Nazi
gas chambers as just a ``detail in World War II history.''
   Judge Lefoyer de Costil, presiding in the Nanterre court outside
Paris, said Le Pen should pay one franc to each of the 11 religious
and human rights groups that filed suit against him following the
remark.
   He also ordered the judgment printed in five national
newspapers, five regional papers and six weeklies. In addition, Le
Pen must pay $720 to each of the groups to cover their legal fees,
the judge ruled.
   Le Pen ``committed a fault for which he cannot validly exonerate
himself by invoking freedom of expression, which has as a limit ...
certain essential values and respect for others,'' the judge told
the court.
   He called Le Pen's choice of words ``shocking,'' saying they
``put into question, banalize or, at the very least, make less
specifically dramatic the persecutions and sufferings inflicted on
deportees and particularly on Jews and Gypsies by the Nazis.''
   Le Pen, who did not attend the trial, said the decision was
another move in the ``general offensive'' against his National
Front.
   ``All means are good to try to sweep the National Front and the
millions of French who, more so each day, put their hope in it,''
Le Pen said in a written statement. He did not say whether he would
appeal.
   Le Pen, 61, who has about 15 percent support in recent opinion
polls, has been increasingly ostracized since the desecration two
weeks ago of a Jewish cemetery in the southern town of Carpentras.
Several towns have refused to allow meetings of his National Front
party.
   Le Pen maintains that France is being overrun by immigrants.
Under the motto ``French First,'' he wants to expell immigrants and
enact laws to keep them out. Le Pen has repeatedly been accused of
racism and anti-Semitism, but denies the allegations.
   Planning Minister Lionel Stoleru said the decision was both ``a
victory and a relief.''
   ``To be proud to be French is from now on to be proud to combat
Jean-Marie Le Pen,'' the minister said.
   Le Pen, a deputy in the European Parliament, caused a scandal
with his remarks about the gas chambers in a 1987 radio interview.
   In the past six months, the Justice Ministry has succeeded in
having Le Pen's parliamentary immunity lifted to prosecute him on
two issues. The first was a play on words he made in 1988 linking a
Cabinet minister to the Nazi crematory ovens, and the second, a
1989 interview in which he said ``large internationals, like the
Jewish international, play a non-negligible role in the creation of
this anti-national spirit.''
   Numerous political and civic leaders have accused Le Pen of
creating an atmosphere of racial intolerance that led to the
desecration at Carpentras, where a corpse was mutilated and 34
tombs were desecrated.
   On Wednesday, police questioned 15 people around the southern
town of Albi. All the suspects were later released.
   Several newspapers in southern France published a letter
Wednesday claiming responsibility for the desecration in the name
of a Moslem organization, the Mohammed El Boukhima group.
   Police sources said the letter was considered to have ``little
credibility.''
   Shortly after the discovery May 10 of the desecration, an
anonymous caller to a local paper claimed responsibility for the
crime in the name of the same unknown group.

   Mary Victor Bruce, the daredevil pilot who broke
land, air and sea speed records and was once arrested for flying
circles around the Empire State Building, has died, her son said
Wednesday. She was 94.
   She died Monday ``of old age,'' said her son and sole survivor,
Anthony Bruce.
   The pioneer race car driver, speed boat captain and pilot, who
once said ``going slowly always makes me tired,'' was christened
Mildred Mary Petre on Nov. 10, 1895.
   She was the only daughter of English nobleman Lawrence Petre,
the squire of Coptfold Hall. Her mother was an American actress and
her great-grandmother was a California gold miner.
   In 1926 she married Victor Austin Bruce. A year later the two
undertook a 6,000-mile tour through Sweden and Finland, penetrating
270 miles north of the Arctic Circle where they planted the Union
Jack after ``running out of road,'' she said.
   In 1929, she broke the 24-hour record by driving alone on the
Montlhery track near Paris. She covered more than 2,200 miles at an
average of 90 mph, a feat that also broke the world record for the
greatest non-stop run by a solo driver.
   Mrs. Bruce took a fancy to boats, and in 1929 made the roundtrip
crossing to France in a record 79 minutes, 24.5 seconds.
   Months after learning to fly, Mrs. Bruce went around the world
alone in her airplane, ``Bluebird.'' The 1930 trip included a crash
on takeoff in Baltimore and her arrest in New York for flying
around the Empire State Building.
   ``She was flying such tight circles around the building that the
typists said they could see the color of her eyes,'' her son told
The Associated Press.
   He said his blue-eyed, petite mother was quickly released and
became the darling of New Yorkers.
   Her accomplishments, listed in Who's Who, include: the first
solo flight from England to Japan in 1930; the longest solo flight
in 1930; record solo flight India to French Indochina in 1930;
British Air refueling endurance flight in 1933; 24-hour record by
motor boat covering 674 nautical miles single-handed 1929.
   Bruce never wore overalls or slacks, preferring a blouse, skirt
and pearl necklace.
   ``Don't call me a women's libber,'' she snapped at an
interviewer later in life. ``I don't really approve. I was a girl
among five brothers and I've always tried to remain feminine.''
   She founded and owned an air ferry service that flew British
newspapers and executives across the English Channel to Paris. The
line signed up the first British stewardess, Daphne Vickers.
   In her spare time, she bought a pony and was first in the open
jumping class at the Royal Horse Show at Windsor in 1939.
   In her mid-70s, she returned to the racetrack to test-drive a
new Ford car. At 81, she made a spectacular air comeback after 30
years, flying a loop the loop in a two-seater plane.
   ``What a lark,'' she was quoted as saying as she left the
airfield in her 1938 Phantom III Rolls-Royce. ``It's knocked 50
years off my life.''

<HEAD>Soviet Naval Construction Rate Highest in Two Decades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is building new warships at the
highest rate in 20 years to replace old vessels that are being
retired, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.
   The latest edition of the respected defense directory, to be
released Thursday, says the Soviet Union will be retiring 17
nuclear submarines, 80 diesel powered submarines, three cruisers
and 25 frigates under a program to rid the navy of technology from
the 1940s and 1950s.
   But a balanced view of the Soviet Fleet ``must include the
unpalatable fact that at the same time as these obsolete ships are
being paid off, the new naval construction rate is, in terms of
tonnage, the highest it has been in 20 years for surface warships
and the highest in the last decade for submarines,'' Capt. Richard
Sharpe wrote in his foreword to Jane's Fighting Ships 1990-1991.
   No precise figure on the total tonnage was available. Sharpe
said he reached his conclusion after studying the figures following
a comment by U.S. Rear Adm. Thomas Brooks, director of naval
intelligence.
   Testifying before a committee of the House Armed Services
Subcommittee on March 14, 1990, Brooks said: ``In terms of tonnage
of submarines accepted by the Soviet Navy, 1989 was the most
productive year since 1980.''
   Brooks added: ``In terms of tonnage of surface competence
(warships) accepted by the Soviet Navy, 1989 was the most
productive year in more than 20 years.''
   Sharp said Soviet naval officials have been arguing the West has
superior naval forces and ``that there has been no positive
response to maritime arms control initiatives.''
   The arguments have convinced policy makers in Moscow that ``the
modernization of the fleet's overall capabilities should continue
without check,'' said Sharpe, a former commander of submarines and
destroyers for the Royal Navy.
   He said the emphasis on fixed-wing aircraft carriers and nuclear
attack submarines seemed to contradict the Soviets' stated doctrine
of defensive sufficiency.
   Analysts who attempt to portray such vessels as purely assets
for strategic defense are being ``depressingly naive,'' he says.
   Sharpe said improvements in the availablity of information from
the Soviet Union made possible the first listing of Soviet warships
scrapped or awaiting the breakers.

<HEAD>North Appears Before Federal Judge, Avoids Grand Jury</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs top 3 grafs to update with grand jury adjourning for the
day shortly after closed-door session with North</NOTE>

   Oliver North appeared in federal court
Wednesday, apparently to challenge a subpoena for his appearance
before a federal grand jury looking into the Iran-Contra affair.
   North and his lawyers attended a closed-door session before U.S.
District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson while the grand jury met on
another floor in the building. Iran-Contra prosecutors also were at
the court session.
   After a hearing that lasted more than half an hour, North and
his lawyers emerged from Robinson's courtroom, bypassed the
third-floor grand jury room and walked out of the courthouse. The
grand jury adjourned for the day an hour and a half later.
   One of North's lawyers, Brendan Sullivan, refused to comment.
Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen and the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh also declined any comment.
   North's brief appearance suggested he has been subpoenaed to
testify before the grand jury but is challenging the subpoena. The
newly empaneled grand jury met for the first time last Friday.
   A court fight over a grand jury subpoena for North's testimony
could take months to resolve. North could appeal any order issued
by Robinson compelling the former White House aide's testimony.
   Sources familiar with the 3{-year-old criminal investigation
have said Walsh's office wants to use the new grand jury in an
attempt to determine the precise roles Ronald Reagan, George Bush
and others had in the affair.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last month
that it was likely North would be called before a grand jury and
that Iran-Contra prosecutors also were likely to call former
National Security Adviser John Poindexter.
   Robinson held North in contempt of court earlier in Walsh's
probe when North refused to comply with a grand jury subpoena. The
legal dispute hinged on North's refusal to provide a grand jury
with a sample of his handwriting in 1987. North's attorneys filed
an appeal and obtained a stay of the judge's order. Walsh
eventually obtained samples of the handwriting of North and other
Iran-Contra defendants.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors also tried unsuccessfully to obtain
North's notebooks through the use of a grand jury subpoena. North
ultimately was forced to turn over the notebooks at his trial last
year when he took the witness stand in his own defense. Some 2,600
pages of North's notebooks have been publicly released over the
past two weeks in connection with a lawsuit filed against the
government by two private groups.
   North, 46, was convicted on May 4, 1989, by a federal court jury
after a two-month trial.
   He was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council
documents and receiving an illegal gratuity. An appeal of his
convictions is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals. North was
placed on two years' probation and ordered to pay a $150,000 fine.
He also is performing 1,200 hours of community service work as part
of his sentence.
   Poindexter, convicted last month of five felonies in connection
with the Iran-Contra affair, is scheduled to be sentenced June 11.
   He could face up to 25 years in prison and $1.25 million in
fines for his convictions on one count of conspiracy, two counts of
obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statements.

<HEAD>Former Lawmaker Wins GOP Primary to Challenge Gov. Andrus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former legislator who says he would have
signed a tough anti-abortion bill ``in a baby's heartbeat'' has won
the Republican nomination to oppose Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus,
who vetoed the bill.
   Former state Senate Majority Leader Roger Fairchild finished
first in a three-way GOP primary race Tuesday, defeating state Sen.
Rachel Gilbert, also an abortion foe, and Boise stockbroker Milton
Erhart, who is pro-choice.
   In the battle to succeed retiring GOP Sen. James McClure, Rep.
Larry Craig won the Republican primary and Boise businessman Ron
Twilegar captured the Democratic nomination.
   Abortion, which dominated Idaho politics through the winter and
into the spring, was a point of contention in 20 legislative
primaries.
   All eight pro-choice incumbents who faced anti-abortion primary
opponents held on to their seats; the single anti-abortion
incumbent to face a challenge also won. Overall, pro-choice
candidates claimed 12 of the races and abortion foes won eight.
   Fairchild had to overcome charges from his ex-wife that he used
drugs and beat her and her children. He repeatedly denied the
allegations, but pumped $90,000 of his family's money into the
primary, partly to overcome moral questions in the minds of
conservative voters in eastern Idaho.
   ``I'm not a silk-stocking politician, I never have been,''
Fairchild said Wednesday. ``I'm accepted in the fields and the
factories and the woods.''
   Andrus, who had no primary opposition in his bid for an
unprecedented fourth term, drew fire from some conservatives for
his March 30 veto of what would have been the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law. Andrus has maintained his
opposition to abortion but said the bill was too strict in cases of
rape and incest and too liberal in cases of severe fetal deformity.
   ``We're going to move on with our campaign as we planned it,
showing where we were four years ago, where we are now and where
we're going,'' Andrus said Wednesday, referring to the fact the
state is in the third year of a strong economic resurgence.
   Final unofficial returns in the GOP primary gave Fairchild
37,690 votes, or 37 percent, to 33,546 votes, or 33 percent,
Gilbert, and 30,524 votes or 30 percent to Erhart.
   In the GOP Senate race, Craig had 66,249 votes, or 59 percent,
to 45,689 votes, or 41 percent, for Attorney General Jim Jones.
   On the Democratic side Twilegar had 30,197 votes, or 64 percent,
to 16,658 votes, or 36 percent, for political newcomer David Steed.

   President Aristides Pereira of Cape
Verde said Wednesday he is quitting the West African nation's
ruling party to help prepare for multiparty rule, the news agency
Lusa reported.
   Pereira has ruled this island archipelago as a Marxist-inspired,
one-party state since independence from Portugal in 1975.
   However, the ruling African Party for the Independence of Cape
Verde announced plans in April to revise the constitution to allow
presidential elections by direct universal suffrage.
   Pereira said Wednesday he would leave the party at its congress
scheduled for July, the Portuguese news agency reported. He now
serves as the party's general secretary.
   ``The president of the republic must have full autonomy in
relation to all political forces,'' he said during his speech to
the People's National Assembly in the Cape Verdian capital of Praia.
   Cape Verde, 385 miles off Senegal, is the second of Portugal's
five former African colonies to announce plans to break with
single-party rule. Sao Tome e Principe announced last year that
competition among political parties will be allowed in future
elections.
   Pereira said his departure from the party would help ensure
openess in an ``examplary transition'' to multiparty democracy,
Lusa reported.
   A party spokesman said the presidential elections, expected in
December, would be on a nonpartisan basis. The party has said
multiparty parliamentary elections will follow.

<HEAD>Mandela: ANC Stands by Nationalization Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ANC stands by its policy
of nationalizing major private industries, but would be willing to
negotiate government participation rather than takeovers, Nelson
Mandela said Wednesday.
   The African National Congress leader spoke to 300 South African
businessmen, about 40 ANC delegates and representatives of leading
labor organizations.
   After the conference he told reporters the ANC has not changed
its view that banks, mining companies and other major private
industries must be nationalized.
   ``We are not rethinking our nationalization policy,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``Government participation must be done in
cooperation with the corporate sector. There are different forms of
government participation and this will be negotiated.''
   Murray Hofmeyr, chairman of the Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment Co. Ltd. mining house, said the meeting had shown
``there is a lot of disagreement between the business community and
the ANC. We have a long way to go. There is also a degree of
mistrust ... which will have to be overcome.''
   But Hofmeyr also said there were areas of common ground, such as
agreement on the need to end racial discrimination, transform the
economic, political and social orders, and to retain the confidence
of investors.
   Mandela said the ANC policy on nationalization is designed to
bring social change in South Africa.
   ``If we are genuinely interested in ending the old social order
and bringing in a new one, it is quite obvious that the economic
power relations represented by the reality of the excessive
concentration of power in a few white hands have to change,''
Mandela said in his speech.
   ``I would, however, like to share a secret with you,'' Mandela
said. ``The view that the only words in the economic vocabulary
that the ANC knows are nationalization and redistribution is
mistaken.''
   Mandela suggested considering methods such as the U.S.
anti-trust laws or the British Monopolies Commission ``to ensure
that there is no unhealthy over-concentration of economic power.''
   He also said future governments might place directors on the
boards of private companies ``to see whether it is possible to
balance pursuit of private gain with the need to promote common
good.''
   In some areas, Mandela said, it may be necessary to establish or
strengthen public corporations to redress the disparity in economic
opportunity and share of national wealth after centuries of white
domination in South Africa.
   Mandela said the ANC was firmly opposed to the government's
current program of privatizing public services.
   ``It would seem only reasonable that so important a question as
the disposal of public property should be held over until a truly
representative government is in place,'' he said.
   The government led by F.W de Klerk has implemented a series of
reforms that included releasing Mandela from jail in February after
27 years. De Klerk and the ANC also met to pave the way for
negotiations on black-white power sharing.

   The Soviets have kept up the size of their navy in
the Persian Gulf despite the end of the Cold War, a U.S. military
commander was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, commander of the Joint Task Force
Middle East, told Kuwaiti newspapers that ``Moscow currently has 10
to 12 ships in the waterway _ the same number it had during the
Gulf war.''
   Fogarty commands U.S. naval forces that have been gradually
reduced from 27 ships at the height of the 8-year Iraq-Iran war to
six warships and a command vessel within the Gulf. Another U.S.
battlegroup is in the region but outside the Gulf.
   The Soviets built up their navy inside the Gulf about the same
time as the Americans.
   In his remarks published by the Arabic daily Al-Qabas and the
English-language Arab Times, Fogarty also renewed the U.S.
commitment to ``defend friendly states in the Gulf and protect
their and our interests.''
   Fogarty talked to Kuwaiti reporters during a port call by the
USS Reid, a guided-missile frigate.

   Israel rejected on Wednesday the Bush
administration's attempt to link the slaying of seven Palestinian
laborers by an apparently deranged Israeli gunman to lack of
progress in Mideast negotiations.
   ``There is no correlation between the act of one crazed
individual and the peace process,'' the Israeli embassy said.
   The statement cautioned the Bush administration that its linking
of the violence to the diplomatic stalemate ``is liable to be seen
by certain groups as a reason to continue the violence in the hope
of attaining their ends.''
   Terming the shooting Sunday near Tel Aviv a tragedy, Israel said
irresponsible elements led by the Palestine Liberation Organization
were cynically exploiting the incident to incite violence on the
West Bank and in Gaza.
   The Israeli army is dealing with the extremely difficult
situation with ``maximum restraint,'' the embassy statement said.
   In a related development Wednesday, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said the Bush administration was willing to discuss at a
U.N. Security Council meeting the idea of sending a United Nations
observer team to the occupied territories.
   The council will hold the meeting in Geneva so PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat could attend. Arafat would have required a U.S. visa
to be at the meeting if it were held at U.N. headquarters in New
York.
   Arafat had approached the Bush administration through U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but a showdown was
averted when the meeting was shifted.
   Baker, asked at a White House news conference if he had opposed
a visa for Arafat, replied: `There was never any formal application
for a visa, so the question is hypothetical.''
   On Monday, the State Department said lack of progress in
negotiations increases the likelihood of violence and bloody
crackdowns, such as the shooting and subsequent violence on the
West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``We see that as another sign that there must be a peace
process,'' the department said in a statement read by spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   ``In the absence of a peace process the potential for this kind
of senseless violence and spiraling responses afterwards goes up,''
he said.
   The statement was issued after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
deplored the shooting and expressed condolences to the victims and
their families.
   The embassy statement Wednesday said Israel and its citizens
have condemned the coldblooded murder of seven Palestinians and the
wounding of 11 others at Rishon La Zion.
   ``Restrained and balanced reactions on the part of the
international community will contribute to the restoration of calm
in the area,'' the statement said.

   A leading Christian cleric urged President
Ibrahim Babangida to include more Christian southerners in the
ruling military council that is dominated by Moslem northerners,
newspapers reported Wednesday.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Olubumi Okogie also appealed
to Babangida to spare the lives of soldiers who led a failed coup
on April 22. The soldiers said they wanted to end Moslem domination
of Nigerian politics.
   Okogie was speaking at a Tuesday news conference in his capacity
as president of the Christian Association of Nigeria, according to
newspapers in the capital of Lagos.
   Okogie said the nation could be ``on the path to a crisis'' if
Christians were not given more power in the government. In his
address he repeatedly referred to Sudan, where Christians and
animists in the south are fighting a guerrilla war against Moslem
northerners who dominate the government.
   It is estimated Moslems account for slightly more than half of
Nigeria's 100 million people. But previous attempts at a census in
Africa's most populous nation have been foiled by groups that have
registered inflated numbers of people for political purposes.
   Christians were deeply angered by a January reshuffle of the
ruling council that removed two leading Christian southerners,
Defense Minister Lt. Col. Domkat Bali and Internal Affairs Minister
John Shagayi, leaving no Christians or southerners holding
important portfolios.
   On Monday, the military began a court-martial of 10 soldiers
accused of organizing the coup attempt. Two hundred other soldiers
and an unknown number of civilians have also been detained for
questioning in connection with the rebellion.
   In the first few hours of the coup, the rebels almost killed
Babangida during a tank bombardment of his house.

<HEAD>Suit That Questioned Garbo Memoir Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit that questioned the accuracy of a
Greta Garbo biography was settled out of court, both sides sides
said Wednesday.
   ``Greta: Her Story,'' was released last week.
   Its dust jacket says it is an ``unauthorized memoir of Garbo,
based on a long and intimate friendship,'' with ``Garbo's own
memories,'' as reported by the author, the late Antoni Gronowicz.
   The reclusive screen legend died last month at age 84.
   A settlement of the suit by Garbo's niece and only heir, Grey
Reisfield, was signed Monday.
   In confirming the settlement Wednesday, neither Reisfield's
lawyer nor the publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, would say if any
changes would be made in the book or the way it is marketed.
   Theodore A. Kurz, Reisfield's attorney, said the terms of the
settlement required it be kept confidential. But in a statement
Wednesday he said he was ``extremely gratified by the outcome and
that the estate's concerns had been addressed.''
   Simon &amp; Schuster issued a statement calling the settlement
``amicable.''
   ``The words that purport to be Garbo's are not _ they are
Gronowicz's, impersonating Garbo, and are imaginary,'' the
copyright infringement suit said.
   Attempting to block publication herself, Garbo swore in a 1978
affidavit that, ``To the best of my knowledge I have never even met
(Gronowicz) at any time in my life.''
   The niece's suit, filed Friday against Simon &amp; Schuster, alleged
the publisher was making false marketing statements about the book.
It didn't ask for money damages, but sought an injunction against
sale of the book.
   ``This action is brought, not to stop Simon &amp; Schuster from
selling this book, but to require that it do so accurately and
honestly,'' the suit said.
   The court papers said publisher Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. rejected the
book in 1972 because Gronowicz couldn't prove its authenticity.
   Simon &amp; Schuster, in a statement read by spokeswoman Barbara
Reno, said it would not have published the book, ``had it not
believed in the fundamental accuracy of the book.''
   Gronowicz's work has been questioned before, most notably in the
early 1980s with ``God's Broker,'' which purported to be the life
of Pope John Paul II as told in his own words. The Vatican denied
Gronowicz had ever spoken to the pope.
   The publisher withdrew the book in 1984 and sued Gronowicz,
calling the book ``fraudulent'' and ``a disaster.''

   Lithuania's parliament tried again Wednesday to
get the Kremlin to the negotiating table by offering to suspend
some of the laws it passed after declaring independence March 11,
but not the declaration itself.
   Lithuanian officials said earlier Wednesday that Soviet energy
sanctions imposed on the Baltic republic five weeks ago will force
all but emergency vehicles off the road by the weekend.
   Lithuania's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, encouraged
countrymen to ``survive as though we were in a surrounded
fortress.''
   ``We are poor, but we'll not starve to death,'' Landsbergis said
in a speech reported by the Lithuanian news agency ELTA. ``Our main
weapon is unity and stamina.''
   In a conciliatory gesture, the republic's Supreme Council voted
74-15, with 10 abstentions, for a resolution that offers to suspend
the laws if Moscow agrees to talks.
   The resolution did not spell out which laws could be suspended,
but Soviet officials have objected to measures that would create a
system of special identification cards for Lithuanian citizens, bar
Soviet army draft boards in Lithuania and establish Lithuanian
control over its borders.
   Wednesday's resolution said Lithuania decided ``to temporarily
suspend, for the period of official interstate negotiations, those
actions and decisions arising from realization of the March 11,
1990, acts of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania
related to interests that could be defined by both parties as
objects of negotiations,'' said a text released by the Lithuanian
parliament's press office.
   Before Wednesday's announcement, the Baltic situation was
settling into a stalemate as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
insisted that Lithuania and its sister republics of Latvia and
Estonia retreat from independence.
   Landsbergis and other Baltic leaders have said they are willing
to compromise but will not surrender their goal of seceding from
the Soviet Union, which forcibly annexed all three republics in
1940. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia had been independent between
World War I and World War II.
   Gorbachev responded to Lithuania's declaration of independence
by cutting off oil, natural gas and key raw materials. Since energy
supplies were cut off April 18, factories in Lithuania have ground
to a halt, traffic has thinned out and 19,000 people have lost
their jobs.
   Soviet authorities have blocked hard currency transfers to all
three Baltic republics, but otherwise have not used the economic
punishments against Latvia and Estonia for their more cautious
approach to secession.
   A committee directing a strike by non-Estonian workers for the
past three days to protest Estonia's secession drive decided
Wednesday night to call off the walkout, Tass reported. The
official Soviet news agency said workers were told to return to
their jobs Thursday because the strike committee felt the main
goal, to publicize its cause, was achieved.
   The Estonian News Agency said Soviet Vice President Anatoly
Lukyanov sent a telegram asking that the strike end ``in view of
the complicated political and economic situation in the country.''
The report said the telegram was sent ``on behalf of the Soviet
president'' _ Gorbachev.
   Twenty-one businesses reportedly were struck in Tallinn, the
Estonian capital. The Estonian government responded by trying to
block food shipments to the strikers, the Soviet national newspaper
Izvestia reported.
   The Baltic independence declarations angered Gorbachev and
raised concerns among non-Baltic residents that their rights might
be jeopardized. Gorbachev calls the declarations illegal.
   He met Tuesday with the presidents of Latvia and Estonia, but
did not budge from his hard line against their independence.
   Radio Vilnius said Wednesday that shutting down transport in
Lithuania would throw 28,000 more people out of work.
   Food is plentiful, but the energy crunch has forced authorities
to curb electricity to industry for three hours a day, Lithuanian
officials said.
   ``The energy shortage is getting bad,'' Lithuanian parliament
spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said. ``By the end of the week, most bus
routes will be cut. The only thing left will be emergency services,
like ambulances and fire trucks.''
   Gasoline sales to private vehicles have all but stopped, and
only 3,500 out of 13,000 government and commercial vehicles will be
running by the weekend, Radio Vilnius said, quoting the
Communications Ministry.
   By Friday, the oil-burning electrical generation plant at
Elektrenai was expected to run out of fuel, further curtailing
industrial production, Ms. Dapkus said.

   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader,
said Wednesday that China may eventually accept democratic change
and loosen its grip on his Himalayan homeland.
   However, he said the process, if it occurs, will take up to a
decade.
   Opening a private visit to Italy, last year's Nobel Peace Prize
winner said he hoped the changes sweeping Eastern Europe will also
occur in China and lead to greater freedom for Tibet.
   ``I predict, however, that it will be a long process, from five
to 10 years _ although that's not meant to be a prophecy,'' he told
reporters at Marco Polo Airport.
   The Dalai Lama fled to exile in India after a Tibetan uprising
was crushed by Chinese troops in 1959.

   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleburger on Wednesday urged Western allies to provide the
emerging Eastern European democracies with economic gifts, rather
than loans.
   ``Loans would just add to the great debt burden that Eastern
Europe already has,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleburger told an international conference on aid to Eastern
Europe.
   Most of the proposals from other countries have been for loans.
   International financial leaders doubted if enough grants could
be put together.
   ``I hope Mr. Eagleburger will take the lead,'' said Barber
Conable, president of the World Bank.
   Conable said interest rates for World Bank loans to Eastern
Europe could not even be reduced.
   Michael Camdessus, managing director of the Intertional Monetary
Fund, said that although grants would be more desirable, he doubted
Western nations had enough money available to send funds to Eastern
Europe.
   The United States is committed to $533 million in aid for Poland
and Hungary this year, most of it in form of grants or credit
guarantees.
   President Bush has proposed adding $300 million next year to the
$205 million in assistance already approved for fiscal years 1991
and 1992.
   Eagleburger acknowledged the administration has no overall
blueprint for helping the region.
   ``Anyone who had such a blueprint would have had to change it
several times recently,'' he said.
   Despite his opposition to loans, Eagleburger endorsed the newly
organized European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which
will have $12 billion available for lending to the area.
   He said it would be useful for large-scale projects which would
be too big for any one donor country or small group of countries.
   The United States, one of 24 countries in Western Europe,
America and Asia which set up the new European bank, is expected to
provide about 10 percent of the initial funding for the bank.

   A 93-year-old widow has $127,000 coming to
her from stocks and cash she simply forgot about more than 20 years
ago, state officials said Wednesday.
   Thea Sala will get $127,045, found in an unclaimed safety
deposit box said Controller Gray Davis. It was recovered under a
state program to return unclaimed property to its owners.
   A check for $37,891 will be written for the cash portion and the
rest, mostly stock, will be turned over within six weeks, Davis
said.
   Ten percent of the money will go to Wayne Eproson of Sacramento,
the ``heir-finder'' who found Sala living in a downtown Oakland
residential hotel.
   Sala, who didn't attend the ceremony, asked that reporters leave
her alone, said Edd Fong, a spokesman for Davis' office.
   There have been some news reports that the widow, described by
Eproson as ``a little forgetful,'' planned to turn the money over
to charity.
   Fong said the finding was the second biggest returned property
coup in California. The largest was the $207,000 given to a
71-year-old homeless man in Los Angeles in 1988.
   Sala, whose husband died several years ago, has no children.
   The find was announced at an auction for property from unclaimed
bank deposit boxes throughout California. Davis told the 150 people
at the auction that his office has more than $500 million in
unclaimed property belonging to 1.5 million account holders.

   President Bush on Wednesday announced a new
government effort, to be coordinated by Commerce Secretary Robert
A. Mosbacher, to help promote U.S. exports.
   Bush said the group, called the ``Trade Promotion Coordinating
Committee,'' was a first step toward providing U.S. businesses with
a ``one-stop shop'' for trade promotion.
   ``This committee will, for the first time, harness all the
resources of the federal government to serve American exporting
businesses,'' Bush said.
   Speaking at a Rose Garden ceremony honoring World Trade Week,
Bush said the unit was charged with helping U.S. companies ``move
competitively into foreign markets.''
   It is the second panel to promote U.S. competitiveness that Bush
has named. Earlier in his presidency, he created a Council on
Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   White House aides said the new committee would not replace
Quayle's council, but work alongside it.
   Bush said the committee would put particular emphasis on
promoting American businesses in new or neglected markets.
   Also sitting on the committee will be representatives from the
Departments of State, Treasury, Agriculture, Defense, Energy,
Transportation, the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Trade
Representative, the Small Business Administration and the
Export-Import Bank.
   ``As the winds of freedom blow down old barriers and liberalize
new markets from Managua to Warsaw, we must be prepared to take
advantage of this opportunity, historic opportunity, to compete and
to win,'' Bush said.

   Almost 10,000 people carrying Palestinian
and Lebanese flags marched in Moslem west Beirut on Wednesday to
protest an Israeli's killing of seven Palestinians near Tel Aviv
this weekend.
   The protesters marched to a local U.N. office and handed
officials a memorandum calling on international humanitarian
organizations and the United Nations to take ``swift and categoric
action against the colonialist crimes and Israel's aggressiveness.''
   The protesters also burned effigies of President Bush and
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in front of the five-story
U.N. office.
   Also on Wednesday, Moslems observed a general strike to protest
the killings.
   Government offices, banks, schools, shops, amusement centers and
other businesses closed for the day in Moslem west Beirut, south
Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and north Lebanon.
   Beirut international airport closed for an hour to observe the
strike.
   The strike coincided with a general strike in the Israeli
occupied territories to protest the slaying of the seven Arab
laborers by an Israeli who police described as deranged.
   The killings led to violent clashes in the occupied territories
and Jordan in which several people have been killed and hundreds
wounded.
   In west Beirut, Palestinians wearing camouflage fatigues and
brandishing automatic rifles demonstrated. Children carrying large
slingshots led the protesters.
   ``I'm carrying a big slingshot and a big stone so that my blow
can have more effect on the Israelis,'' said a 7-year-old boy.
   Slingshots are one of the main weapons used by Palestinian
youths in their 29-month-old uprising against Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the southern port of Sidon, a green BMW rigged with 110
pounds of TNT exploded slightly injuring four civilians, police
said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
standing regulations, said the bomb went off two minutes after
Anwar Madi, a local commander of the Palestinian Fatah
organization, drove by.
   ``It could have been an attempt to assassinate him,'' the
spokesman said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast. Sidon is a main
power base for Fatah, the Palestinian faction led by Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat.

<TEXT>
   Only about one in four developmentally
disabled Americans consider themselves independent enough to
control their own lives, survey results released Wednesday show.
   The study, commissioned by the National Association of
Developmental Disabilies Councils, found that while 75 percent of
the respondents felt it important to be independent, only 26
percent believed they had achieved any level of independence.
Independence was defined as ``making choices and exercising control
over one's life.''
   Only 16 percent of adults were allowed to choose their own
places to live, the survey said. Nearly 60 percent _ both adults
and children _ live on their own or with families rather than in
various types of institutions.
   The survey also found that:
   _78 percent felt it important to be productive, but only 38
percent believed they fit the description of being able to ``work
or make a contribution through productive activity.''
   Only 11 percent said they were completely unable to work. Those
who were employed were paid a weekly average of $60 for 24 hours of
work, with an average hourly wage of $2.87. Statistics show that
people with mental retardation earn nearly two-thirds less than
people with other disabilities.
   _75 percent of respondents felt it important to be integrated,
while only 40 percent felt they were. Integration was defined as
``participating in community life and interacting with other
members of society.''
   Far fewer respondents said they knew their neighbors than those
participating in a survey of non-disabled Americans, the study
said. ``This is despite the fact that most people in the survey
live in their own homes or with relatives.''
   The survey was conducted by the Developmental Disabilities
Center at Temple University in Philadelphia. It was part of a
larger report required by a 1987 law to help Congress determine the
needs of the developmentally disabled. The results also will be
used to help with implementation of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, comprehensive civil rights legislation adopted by the House
Tuesday and expected to become law this summer.
   The combined effort took 2{ years.
   Some 15,000 people _ one out of every 200 people with a
developmental disability _ were interviewed. All states and U.S.
territories were included in the survey.
   The association is the umbrella group for state and territorial
councils that work to improve the lives of people with disabilities.
   The report included a compilation of smaller studies from the
state councils on the needs of the disabled.
   Key recommendations included supporting families ``as needed''
to assure that children grow up in families and using ``funding
mechanisms that support individual choice and control, that fund
individuals rather than facilities, and that reduce rather than
reinforce dependency.''
   Developmental disabilities are impairments that are present at
birth or occur before a person's 22nd birthday. They include mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, chronic mental illness, epilepsy and
autism.

<HEAD>Romania's Iliescu Hits Challengers for Not Accepting Defeat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ion Iliescu, Romania's interim
president and now its president-elect, accused his opposition of
political immaturity Wednesday for complaining that his lopsided
victory in weekend elections was fraudulent.
   He rejected a proposal that a commission be set up to
investigate allegations of electoral fraud, a major demand of the
chief U.S. government observer, Gov. Garrey Carruthers, R-N.M.
   ``None of the foreign observers could point to even one fact
that constitutes fraud,'' Iliescu insisted. ``It's all based on
claims by the opposition.''
   Iliescu reiterated at a news conference Wednesday his claim of a
complete break with his Communist past, and said he wanted the new
government to include ``competent people, regardless of party
affiliation.''
   According to a near-final tally of the vote released Wednesday,
Iliescu received 85 percent of the votes for president and his
National Salvation Front 67 percent of the votes for the
two-chamber Parliament.
   Iliescu said, ``The opposition doesn't want to accept the result
because it's not in their favor. ... They misunderstand the
political game and are displaying political immaturity. It's very
sad when someone doesn't know how to lose.''
   Iliescu and the Front have dominated government since the
December revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. Opposition parties and demonstrators have accused both
of being neo-Communist.
   The president-elect called this charge an ``election slogan.''
   ``Romania's break with communism was the most brusque and
revolutionary in all East Europe,'' he said. ``There is no way
back, and to try such a thing would be political suicide. So it's
impossible.''
   He said his challengers _ Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal
Party and Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant Party _ lost because
they ``misunderstood the character of the revolution and slid to
the extreme right.''
   He said they ``frightened voters away with violent language and
incitements to violence.''
   He said Ratiu and Campeanu, both elderly, longtime exiles,
``showed that they are detached from the realities of Romania and
failed to establish the necessary dialogue with the people.''
   But he added that the Front, which can govern alone if it
chooses, ``remains open to any possible coalition or parliamentary
cooperation.''
   ``We need trained, experienced, competent people, regardless of
party affiliation.''
   He said the priority of the new government would be the creation
of a constitution and development of a ``coherent strategy'' for
transition to a free-market economy.
   Iliescu refused to say if Petre Roman would continue as prime
minister, saying, ``This is up to the new Parliament.''
   Roman said the anti-Front demonstration in downtown University
Square, which has blocked the capital's central intersection for 32
days, was ``inadmissible'' now that ``the government had the
legitimacy of being elected.''
   But Iliescu said no force would be applied to clear the square,
``I hope.''
   He pledged Romania will be ``open to all countries of both East
and West,'' but added: ``We don't want to be dependent on anyone
any more. ... Romanian politics will be made in Romania.''
   Iliescu rejected the proposal, made by Carruthers and other
foreign observers who monitored the election, that Romania must
abolish the state monopoly over electronic media.
   He said state-run television guarantees access to all political
points of view, and that a private channel ``would create a lack of
democratic access.''
   He insisted ``at the present time the press is under no control
or censorship.''

   Senegal and Guinea Bissau agreed Wednesday on a
mutual retreat from their common border to settle a maritime
dispute that has reportedly left 17 soldiers dead, the Senegalese
Embassy announced.
   The two sides are arguing over who controls waters believed to
contain oil deposits. The area is off the land border between the
two West African nations.
   Wednesday's settlement was reached by Foreign Minister Seydina
Oumar Sy of Senegal and Finance Minister Col. Manuel Santos of
Guinea Bissau during a meeting in Paris, the Senegalese Embassy
said.
   The meeting was held during a visit to Paris by Guinea Bissau's
leader, Gen. Joao Bernardo Vieira. However, there was no immediate
comment from Guinea Bissau.
   The Senegalese Embassy statement said the two countries hope to
``find through dialogue peaceful solutions to all questions
regarding their relations.''
   The statement said the two nations' troops would be pulled back
to a ``reasonable distance'' from the border.
   The dispute over maritime borders dates from colonial times.
Since Saturday, clashes on Guinea Bissau's northern land border
have left at least 17 soldiers dead, according to news reports.
   The disputed waters were confirmed as Senegalese territory in
1960 by an exchange of letters between Portugal and France, the
colonial powers at the time.
   However, Guinea Bissau challenged control of the zone when it
gained independence from Portugal in 1974.
   In 1989, Guinea Bissau rejected the verdict of an international
court in Geneva, which found in favor of Senegal. It has taken its
complaint to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

<HEAD>Brazil's President: Economic Shock Treatment is Working</HEAD>

   President Fernando Collor de Mello said
Wednesday his tough anti-inflation plan is working better than
expected, despite an outbreak of strikes to protest layoffs and the
loss of purchasing power.
   He said inflation had plunged from a record 84 percent a month
to 3.3 percent in April. The government's goal initially had been
to reduce inflation to 10 percent a month in 100 days.
   ``The program has turned out much better than we imagined,'' the
president said during his press conference at the Foreign Ministry
in this inland capital.
   Collor said the government had moved up its economic targets for
the first 100 days ``because the results have been surprisingly
positive.''
   The reform plan, which went into effect March 16, froze $115
billion in bank and money-market deposits, fixed prices for a month
and created a new currency.
   In addition, price controls have been lifted on everything
except utility rates and basic foods. The president said the
exchange rate ``is on the verge of total freedom.''
   The bank freeze reduced the amount of money in circulation in
Latin America's most populous nation, with 145 million residents.
Officials believe an excess of cash was the main cause of Brazil's
chronic inflation.
   ``The success of the plan is palpable,'' Collor said. ``The
catastrophic predictions of recession and depression have not
materialized.''
   However, unions and private economic institutions claim the real
inflation rate was as high as 40 percent last month. Buying power
is estimated to have fallen by up to 63 percent in March.
   In recent days, strikes have broken out in cities across the
country to protest the loss of buying power and a rise in layoffs.
Bus and subway workers walked off their jobs in several state
capitals.
   Labor leaders have talked of organizing a general strike.
   The austerity measures have led private companies to fire an
estimated 400,000 workers and put 700,000 others on paid holiday.
The government recently said up to one-fourth of its 1.6 million
employees would be laid off.
   However, Collor said workers would not be jeopardized by the
government's decision to eliminate official cost-of-living raises
and allow free salary negotiations between managers and employees.
   He said the government will intervene if employers ``try to
impose impossible sacrifices on wage earners,'' but he did not
offer details.
   He also said the labor protests would not shake his
determination to carry out the cutbacks. ``My will is firm and the
goals will be met,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former Alabama Congressman Given First Profile In Courage Award</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who lost his political career and was left
in financial ruin because of his fight to help people of all races
get an education won the first Profile in Courage Award on
Wednesday.
   Carl A. Elliott, a 76-year-old Southern Democrat, was awarded
the first John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, instituted by
the Kennedy Library Foundation in Boston.
   During Elliott's 16 years in Congress in the 1950s and 1960s, he
pushed for civil rights and was instrumental in enacting the
far-reaching National Defense Education Act.
   Called a ``living profile in courage,'' Elliott ``faced intense
public scorn and suffered personal abuse and eventual political
defeat while achieving victories for the good of a nation he
loved,'' said Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Kennedy Library
Foundation.
   Elliott was defeated in 1964 by pro-segregation forces
spearheaded by Gov. George Wallace and two years later lost a bid
for governor to Lureen Wallace, the wife of Wallace, who was
prevented by law from succeeding himself.
   That defeat left him in heavy debt, he said.
   ``I spent much more than every penny I had. I've been wrestling
with those debts ever since and still am,'' Elliott said.
   But he'll get some help from the award. Next Tuesday he'll
receive a trophy crafted by Tiffany &amp; Co. in the shape of a ship's
beacon, as well as a $25,000 stipend.
   Elliott, once a hulking figure, is now a frail diabetic,
confined to a wheelchair and legally blind, Kirk said.
   Bill Barnard, chairman of the history department at the
University of Alabama, said Elliott is the embodiment of the old
adage about a prophet not being honored in his own country.
   ``That is what happened to Carl Elliott. You only hope you live
long enough to be recognized for your accomplishments,'' Barnard
said.
   The Profile in Courage Award was created by the Kennedy Library
Foundation in 1989 to honor President John F. Kennedy and encourage
people to value courage in elected officials.
   Elliott, now a retired attorney, delighted in the long-overdue
recognition as reporter after reporter telephoned his modest home
in downtown Jasper, Ala.
   ``I understand there were 5,000 nominations. It makes me feel
good to be chosen,'' he said. ``I feel this will help the cause of
education.''
   ``Here's a role model who was consistent with what President
Kennedy himself believed,'' Kirk said. ``Here's a fellow who knew
what the price would be politically and paid it.''
   In 1948 Elliott was elected to House of Representatives, two
years after Kennedy was first elected to the House. But his
commitment to education began when, as the son of tenant farmers,
he believed then-University of Alabama President George Denny when
he said anyone willing to work could make his way through the
university.
   Elliott took Denny at his word and arrived on campus with $2.38.
Denny soon found the impoverished student sleeping in a deserted
building and gave him a batch of odd jobs.
   That experience prompted Elliott to spend 10 years trying to
pass a bill that became the National Defense Education Act of 1958,
the first billion-dollar education bill ever passed by Congress and
the foundation for today's student loans and grants.
   He continued to fight for federal education aid, despite fears
of many Southerners that it would open the doors of colleges to
more blacks.
   ``There was a lot of talk of that, but we wrote that bill to
take care of all Americans who were bright and wanted to go to
college,'' he said.
   He admits to some bitterness about having his political career
cut short, but he said, ``I'm not blaming anybody about any of it.
I fought the good fight, and I'm proud of it.''
   Of the more than 5,000 nominations for the award, four others
were selected as finalists. They are: Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon,
a former U.S. Senator; Unita Blackwell, the mayor of Mayersville,
Miss., and the first black mayor in the state; LeRoy Collins,
former governor of Florida; and Morris K. Udall, a member of the
House of Representatives since 1961.

   Federal engineers are stepping up an
investigation of reported steering wheel vibrations in Hyundai
Excels manufactured between 1987 and 1989, the government said
Wednesday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had
received 294 complaints of extreme vibrations when the cars reach
highway speeds.
   The problem has been blamed for two accidents and two injuries,
agency spokesman Tim Hurd said. An estimated 707,000 of the cars
are on the road.
   The agency upgraded its investigation from a preliminary
evaluation, involving mostly paperwork, to an engineering analysis
in which the parts being questioned are inspected. The process
could lead to a recall.
   Also upgraded to engineering analysis status were preliminary
evaluations of 1987-88 General Motors Astro and Safari minivans and
1989-90 Chrysler Cherokee Wagoneers.
   There have been 300 complaints of power steering loss in the
Astro and Safari after breakage of the power steering pump bracket.
An estimated 362,000 of the minivans are on the road. One accident
has been linked to the problem.
   The agency has received 16 complaints about the Wagoneer's
anti-lock brakes, including wheel lockup to brake failure, Hurd
said. The problem has been blamed for one accident and an injury.
An estimated 17,000 of the vehicles are on the road.
   Preliminary evaluations were opened last month on:
   _Six complaints of engine fires in the 1985 Buick Skyhawk. An
estimated 82,000 are on the road.
   _Two complaints of front brake discs becoming detached on Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable, 1986-89 models. An estimated 1.2 million
are on the road.
   _One complaint of a broken rear axle assembly on the 1987 Ford
Aerostar, of which 166,000 are on the road.
   _Two complaints of hood latch failure on the 1990 Mercury Cougar.
   _A Winnebago service bulletin reporting windshield wiper arm
lockup on the company's 1990 M series. An estimated 244 of the
recreational vehicles are on the road.
   _Six complaints of wheel bearing failure on the 1983-85
Winnebago LeSharo, of which 20,000 are on the road.
   The agency discontinued several preliminary evaluations after
finding no defect trend or evidence of an unreasonable safety risk.
Among them were probes of structural weld failures in the 1989 GM
GEO Tracker, weld failures in the 1989 Suzuki Sidekick, and speed
control problems in the 1984-89 GMC Suburban.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Says He Speaks German Better After a Drink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles said Wednesday that he speaks
German better after a drink.
   The 41-year-old son of Queen Elizabeth II and heir to the
British throne told a group of businessmen: ``I am the kind of
Englishman, I think, who finds conversing in a foreign language is
made much easier with the assistance of a small alcoholic beverage.
   ``Maybe that is why I succeeded in failing my O-level German _
alcohol was restricted at school,'' he joked.
   O-levels are Britain's school-leaving examinations that are
taken by students when they are about 16.
   On a more serious note, the prince said Britain urgently needs
to make up lost ground by learning foreign languages if it is to
maintain its competitive edge in the world.
   In a separate interview published Wednesday in The Scotsman,
Prince Charles said he was sometimes demoralized by the ``vitriolic
personal abuse'' he has attracted with his six-year campaign for
better architecture.
   ``I try not to, but occasionally I get demoralized or dispirited
by it,'' the prince said.
   But Prince Charles said he would intensify his campaign.
   ``I would not have gone on with my activities on the
architectural design and development front unless I felt there was
support from the public or that I had struck a chord,'' he said.
   The prince last year produced a book on his personal view of
architecture, ``A Vision of Britain,'' and made a television
documentary on the subject. His attacks on modern architecture have
prompted protests from some architects.
   The prince dislikes office blocks towering over St. Paul's
Cathedral in London, wayside gas stations, factories, department
stores and high-rise apartments on open plains. He tends to favor
classic-style buildings with porticoes and columns, and
turn-of-the-century homes.

<HEAD>Experts' Advice: Follow The Money To Catch Spies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee of experts urged Congress on
Wednesday to let investigators monitor the personal finances of
government and defense workers who know top secrets because most
modern spies work for money.
   After nine months of study on behalf of Sens. David Boren,
D-Okla., and William Cohen, R-Maine, chairman and vice chairman of
the Senate Intelligence Committee, the panel proposed 13 new laws.
   Many of the proposals are aimed at the 700,000 government and
contract workers who have access to top secret information. To get
those jobs, they would be required to allow investigators access to
their bank and commercial credit records anytime up to five years
after they leave the secret work.
   They would be required to report any foreign travel or contacts
by citizens of foreign countries.
   Employees who work with codes and code machines would be subject
to random polygraph tests. Questions would be limited to whether
they spied or sold secrets and not ask _ in Sen. Boren's words _
``how many cocktails they drank or X-rated movies they saw.''
   The experts also recommended making it a crime to possess spy
tools, like burst transmitters and secret writing devices, with
intent to commit espionage.
   ``We hope this legislation would raise the risk that individuals
would run by engaging in espionage, first, that they would be
caught and, second, that they would end up paying a penalty,
serving time in jail,'' said retired Navy Adm. Bobby Ray Inman,
former CIA deputy director.
   Inman and other panel members told a hearing of the Senate
Intelligence Committee that the nine-member panel had looked for
patterns in the spy cases of recent years. In the 1960s there was
``an overwhelmingly shift from recruitment'' of spies through
ideology to ``volunteer'' spies, usually seeking money, he said.
   He presented an analysis of 19 well-known cases in the last 20
years. Money was a motive in 14.
   Sen. Boren said the experts had pointed out ``a blind spot'' in
U.S. defenses. Once workers obtain security clearances, ``we know
less about them financially than if they're applying for an auto
loan,'' Boren said.
   The experts and the senators emphasized that the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe and its internal difficulties in the
Soviet Union had not lessened the spy threat.
   ``More and more foreign government will be out to steal our
national economic secrets,'' Sen. Boren predicted.
   Warren Christopher, a Los Angeles lawyer who served as No. 2
official in the Justice and State departments, said: ``Looking west
from the Pacific Rim, the world does not seem so much changed. It
seems more dangerous, particularly in terms of economic espionage.''
   But under questioning from Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., Columbia
University law professor Harold Edgar acknowledged that ``the
proposals do not specifically treat economic espionage'' aimed at
private corporate secrets unless they also are government defense
secrets.
   In addition, the panel proposed:
   _Two more criminal violations: selling any document labelled top
secret and removing top secret documents from government custody.
The government would no longer have to disclose what was in the
secret documents.
   _Giving the FBI the right to obtain credit records in secret
with a letter assuring the credit bureau that the subject was
suspected of spying, and allowing the FBI to obtain secretly the
names of unlisted telephone owners who call suspects in a spy case.
   These two are being proposed already by the Bush administration
but have been rejected by Congress before. The American Civil
Liberties Union has opposed both, arguing that the FBI has not
shown a need and that the government could collect data on people
making innocent calls.
   _Barring spies from profiting from books about their crimes.
   _Denying government retirement pay to U.S. workers convicted in
foreign courts of disclosing U.S. secrets.
   _Establishing a $1 million reward for turning in a spy.
   _Requiring the FBI to obtain a warrant from the secret Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court before burglarizing a suspected
spy. Such warrants are required to plant listening device; the
burglaries, so-called ``black bag jobs,'' are done under inherent
presidential powers.
   The Carter administration persuaded the court to issue three
warrants for burglaries, but the Reagan administration convinced
the judges that they did not have the power to issue burglary
warrants.
   _Allowing the National Security Agency, the nation's code
agency, to provide after-care and counseling to troubled employees,
because several spies began work after they quit.
   The panel was informally chaired by venture capitalist Eli
Jacobs, Baltimore Orioles baseball team owner and government
defense adviser.
   Other members are: former CIA Director Richard Helms; former
Carter White House counsel Lloyd Cutler; former Reagan White House
counsel Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr.; former ambassador to the
Organization of American States Sol Linowitz and former ambassador
and State Department official Seymour Weiss.

   Thousands of flag-waving Israelis celebrated
the 1967 capture of Arab east Jerusalem, and the government
launched a counteroffensive at critics who link its hard-line
policies to the killings of seven Arabs.
   In neighboring Jordan, a Palestinian rioter was shot to death
and four other people, including two policemen, were seriously
wounded during a six-hour clash at the Hitteen refugee camp near
the capital of Amman, police reported.
   Hundreds of Jordanian police fired live ammunition and tear gas
at the massed demonstrators in an effort to prevent looting and
rioing but police said two branches of the Jordan Housing Bank on
the outskirts of the refugee camp were gutted by rioters.
   Police said the dead rioter ``was killed by a bullet of a type
not used by the police,'' implying he was shot accidentally by
other demonstrators.
   That raised the casualty toll in Jordan to four dead and 29
wounded in three days of violent Palestinian demonstrations over
the murder of seven Palestinian laborers on Sunday by a Israeli
civilian described by police as deranged.
   In east Jerusalem's Old City, angry Moslem worshipers hurled
stones at Jewish extremists when the Jews tried to pray near the Al
Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, the site where tradition holds
King Solomon and later King Herod built their temples. No one was
injured.
   The army extended curfews on most of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip for a fourth day to quell violent protests of the Sunday
massacre. About 1.5 million Palestinians were confined to their
homes.
   In Gaza's Bani Suheila village, 8-year-old Mustafa Awad El Fajem
was shot and killed when an unidentified gunman opened fire from a
passing vehicle, an army spokeswoman said.
   She was unsure whether a military vehicle was involved. Israel
radio said the passing vehicle had yellow Israeli license plates
but gave no further details.
   Seven Palestinians were reported wounded by army gunfire in
clashes. Since Sunday's massacre 13 Palestinians have been killed
by Israeli soldiers trying to put down protests and more than 800
have been reported shot, beaten or suffered from tear-gas
inhalation.
   El Fajem's death brought to 708 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis in the 29-month-old Palestinian uprising. At
least 216 other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three Israelis
have also died.
   The European Community, echoing U.S. government statements,
accused Israel of ``excessive force to put down the
demonstrations'' and said the lack of peace efforts had fostered
the upsurge in violence.
   Israeli-U.S. ties have suffered the past two months over the
stalled Middle East peace process and the settlement policies of
hard-line Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States believes ``that absence of a peace process contributes to
violence in the Middle East.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a close Shamir ally in the
right-wing Likud bloc, acknowledged that Israel was on the
defensive.
   ``There is no doubt we are having a difficult period in the
international arena. We have to prepare for a confrontation in this
area,'' he said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud said Israel was
especially concerned with embassy reports indicating that within
foreign governments ``there is an attempt to make a connection
between the murder of seven people and the peace process.''
   Arens told Israel radio: ``We're dealing with a man who went
berserk, killing people indiscriminately. We've seen these kinds of
scenes in other places, including the United States.''
   Israeli authorities say the man charged in Sunday's seven
killings in a Tel Aviv suburb, 21-year-old Ami Popper, was deranged
and also upset by an unhappy love affair. A judge ordered a
psychiatric evaluation for him.
   In Jerusalem, thousands of flag-waving Israelis marched through
the city to mark Jerusalem Day, the 23rd anniversary of the capture
of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem from Egypt
and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967, but the United States and
other Western nations maintain the final status of the city should
be determined in peace talks. Palestinians want east Jerusalem to
be the capital of their would-be state.
   In a related development, a spokesman for Yasser Arafat said the
PLO leader, scheduled to address the U.N. Security Council in
Geneva on Friday, will seek U.N. intervention to protect
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir's adviser Avi Pazner said Israel sees the idea of
stationing U.N. observers in the occupied territories as a
violation of its sovereignity and would ask the United States to
veto such a proposal.
   In Lebanon, almost 10,000 people marched to a local U.N. office
to protest the killing of the Palestinian laborers and to demand
swift action from the United Nations and other international
organizations.

   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted over eastern and
northeast Wyoming, southeast Montana, western South Dakota and the
northern Nebraska panhandle.
   A large high pressure system, reaching from the Great Lakes to
the Ohio Valley, brought chilly temperatures from the Northeast
into the eastern third of the nation.
   Overnight temperatures were unseasonably cool and record lows
were recorded Wednesday in Greer, S.C., with a reading of 46

50. The low temperature for the nation Wednesday morning was 30
degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   A snow advisory was posted Wednesday over the higher elevations
of the Mount Shasta-Siskiyou area and the northern Sierra Nevada of
California. Snow advisories were posted Thursday morning across the
Oregon Cascades.
   At noon, rain and occasional thundershowers were scattered over
New England, the Midwest and Great Lakes region, the Gulf Coast of
Texas, and from Montana through the Pacific Northwest.
   Noon temperatures ranged in the 40s and 50s over New England and

<HEAD>Canada's Mulroney Still Hopes for Conference on Endangered Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Wednesday some
hope remains that differences among Canada's 10 provincial premiers
over the Meech Lake accord can be sufficiently narrowed to hold a
conference.
   Mulroney is working against a June 23 deadline. The accord,
which would recognize the French-speaking province of Quebec as a
distinct society and give all provinces expanded powers, will
expire then unless ratified by the holdout provinces of New
Brunswick, Newfoundland and Manitoba.
   By law, all 10 provinces must ratify the accord, which was
designed to win Quebec's support for the 1982 Constitution.
   Sen. Lowell Murray, Mulroney's personal Meech Lake emissary,
told the prime minister too much divides the premiers to hold an
immediate meeting.
   But Mulroney, who has slept little the last few days as he
searched for a way to save Meech Lake, told the House of Commons
that Murray may have a way out of the impasse.
   Mulroney told opposition leader Herb Gray suggestions that have
been advanced ``might facilitate the bringing together of the
parties so that we could narrow the terrain. That process might
indeed lead to a fruitful first ministers' conference'' _ meaning a
conference of the federal prime minister and the 10 provincial
premiers.
   A special committee led by Quebec Tory Jean Charest made 23
recommendations last week aimed at coming up with a Meech-saving
compromise.
   On Monday, Lucien Bouchard, Mulroney's environment minister and
his senior Quebec minister, resigned from the Tory caucus and the
Cabinet. Quebec rank-and-file member of parliament Gilbert
Chartrant quit the Conservative party Tuesday. Both viewed the
committee report as a sellout of their province.
   Treasury Board President Robert de Cotret was named acting
environment minister Wednesday.
   Bouchard, a longtime friend of Mulroney, campaigned for
sovereignty-association for Quebec in 1980 before joining the
Tories. He said the government now was trying to amend Meech Lake _
breaking a promise it made to Quebec, which contains 6.7 million of
Canada's 25 million residents.
   Bouchard's defection further dampened hopes of Meech Lake's
surviving.
   Opposition to Meech Lake has fanned separation fears in Quebec
and renewed talk of sovereignty-association, in which the province
would be politically distinct but maintain economic ties with the
rest of the country.
   Murray admitted time was running out and called Meech Lake the
ultimate symbol of compromise and openness by Quebec after its
humiliation when the 1982 Constitution was signed without Quebec's
participation.
   Murray called on Mulroney and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa to
accept no changes to the accord, and to let those who are trying to
scuttle Meech Lake suffer the consequences.
   The government of Premier Clyde Wells in Newfoundland rescinded
approval of Meech Lake last month. Wells argues the accord
entrenches regional disparities, blocks Senate reform and gives
Quebec special powers.
   New Brunswick and Manitoba have never approved the accord.

   Affandi, an expressionist painter
whose works were exhibited worldwide, died Wednesday after a long
illness. He was 83.
   He died in the home he designed on the banks of the Gajah Wong
River, 400 miles southeast of Jakarta on Indonesia's main island of
Java. He had been in a coma for several months.
   The artist, considered Indonesia's foremost expressionist
painter, was born in the west Java town of Cirebon and began
professional work in 1938.
   ``Ibu (Mother)'' was a masterpiece of his early realistic works
before he turned to expressionism. ``Self Portrait'' is another
famous work among the 4,000 paintings he created.
   In 1948, he traveled to India and later became a guest lecturer
at the East-West Center in Hawaii.
   His works were exhibited in London, Paris, Rome, Rio de Janeiro
and the Hague. In 1956, he exhibited his works in the United States
under the Asia Foundation grant.
   President Suharto gave him Indonesia's highest award for
artistic achievements.
   ``Fire to Live'' was a 1982 Swedish documentary on the life of
Affandi, who always proclaimed himself a ``sukasrana'' _ a
character in a traditional Javanese puppet story who has
supernatural powers.
   Affandi once said, ``If I don't paint, I feel ashamed.''
   He had vowed to continue painting despite old age, but he was
eventually forced to take up a self-styled type of drawing with his
fingers after pouring paint onto the canvas.
   Survivors include four children and several grandchildren. There
was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.

   Arab foreign ministers agreed Wednesday to
a five-point agenda for an upcoming conference of their kings and
heads of state that will concentrate on Soviet Jewish immigration
to Israel.
   Syria has announced it will boycott the Monday summit, which is
being hosted by its main Arab rival, Iraq.
   The agenda, made available to The Associated Press by a
conference source, also listed perceived threats against Iraq and
Libya and the lack of a peace treaty between Iran and Iraq.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization scored a political victory
when its working paper was adopted with only minor changes as the
recommended draft resolution on the Middle East crisis.
   Egypt had suggested a working paper in line with a controversial
U.S. memorandum to the summit that called on Arabs to support
direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinians and made no
formal reference to a role for the PLO.
   The adpoted draft resolution reiterates support for the PLO's
peace overtures and calls for convening an international peace
conference. The U.S. memorandum had suggested dropping the
international conference from the summit resolutions.
   The paper reiterates that Jerusalem is the capital of an
envisaged Palestinian state and calls for economic and political
sanctions by the Arabs against any country that officially regards
Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state.
   Most nations, including the United States, do not regard
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
   It also called for sanctions against any country or institution
that facilitates the immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   The paper urged governments to open their borders to Soviet Jews
so the emigrants do not have to move to Israel.
   It also called on the United Nations to secure international
supervision of the occupied territories to guard against the
settlement of Soviet Jews in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The draft resolutions will only become binding if it is endorsed
by Arab leaders at the summit. Resolutions drafted at foreign
ministerial meetings are usually approved with few changes.
   The emergency meeting was called by Arafat to discuss Soviet
Jewish immigration to Israel.
   The U.S. memorandum was delivered this weekend to Arab League
Secretary-General Chedli Klibi, who submitted a text in Arabic to
the foreign ministers on Tuesday.
   The memorandum said Washington remains opposed to the
establishment of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied
territories but supported the immigration of Soviet Jews as ``a
perfectly legitimate human right.''
   It urged the Arabs not to ``try and block the right of Jews to
emigrate or Israel's right to absorb them within its own
territories.''

   Marx Lewis, veteran labor organizer,
has died at age 93.
   Accuracy in Media, a watchdog group on whose board he served,
said Lewis died Tuesday of cardiac arrest.
   Lewis earned a law degree from the American University in 1924
but never practiced, chosing to become an organizer for the Cap and
Millinery Workers Union.
   A socialist in his youth, he held several labor positions and
helped organize the Liberal Party of New York. He served in the
administration of Republican New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia
in the 1930s and 1940s and later became a Republican.
   He is survived by two sons, four sisters, five grandchildren and

   A 12-year-old boy set afire by a neighborhood
bully picked his accused assailant's picture from among photographs
brought to his bedside just hours later, an investigator testified
Wednesday.
   Detective Charles Higgins said that on the night of March 7 he
took six photographs, one of them of the suspect, to the New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center where David Opont had been admitted
in critical condition with severe burns over much of his body.
   ``He studied it awhile,'' Higgins said of the photo array, ``and
then in a clear voice he stated No. 2 is one who put fire on me.''
   David's accused assailant, a brawny 13-year-old dressed in
loose-fitting gray shirt and slacks, sat silently through the
hourlong pretrial hearing in Brooklyn Family Court. The boy's name
is being withheld because of his age.
   Meanwhile, David, who had been given only a 50-50 chance of
surviving the attack, has been making a remarkable recovery and
could possibly leave the hospital within the next week, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   David may be called on to testify against the teen charged with
setting him on fire in an abandoned Brooklyn building. He was
walking to school on the day before his 12th birthday when a
neighborhood bully forced him into a vacant building, tied him to a
railing inside, and set him on fire.
   David, who allegedly was robbed by the boy a day earlier,
suffered burns over 55 percent of his body.

<TEXT>
   The Joffrey Ballet's artistic director, Gerald
Arpino, has reversed his decision to resign, the company announced
Wednesday.
   Arpino, who resigned May 1 and withdrew his works and those of
the company's founder from the Joffrey's repetoire, has been
meeting with a committee from the ballet's board of directors since
then, according to a statement issued by the company.
   He resigned after the board voted to set up an operating
committee that would run the company in place of both Arpino and
the 55-member board. Ten board members resigned in protest over
what one member called a takeover by businessmen ignorant of
artistic matters.
   Arpino, whose resignation was never accepted by the board,
continued as artistic director of the company's ballet school.
   Arpino earlier had given permission for his ballets to return to
the company's repertory this Friday, two days before the end of a
four-week season in Los Angeles.
   The co-chairmen of the 55-member board, David Murdock in Los
Angeles and Anthony Bliss in New York, and the company's executive
director, Penelope Curry, all resigned during the month.
   Wednesday's statement from the company said that Arpino and the
committee had reached an agreement ``which resolves all outstanding
issues between Mr. Arpino and the company. ... Under this
agreement, which will be presented for the full board's
consideration at a meeting this Thursday, Mr. Arpino will license
his ballets and those of the late Robert Joffrey to the company.''
   The Joffrey was founded by Arpino and Robert Joffrey in 1956.
Arpino became artistic director following Joffrey's death in 1988.
Arpino has been a dancer and choreographer with the modern ballet
company since its early days.
   However, critics and dance buffs alike have often called his
works pedestrian instead of inspired, and without structure,
purpose or artistry. With the exception of such works as ``Sea
Shadow'' (1962) and ``Viva Vivaldi'' (1965), Arpino is considered a
second-rate choreographer who merely moves dancers around a stage.

<TEXT>
   Most kids would rather play video games
than fight ivory poachers, but some University of Connecticut
educators worked to change that Wednesday.
   The First International Peace Games Festival brought students
from 94 high schools and middle schools around the state,
Massachusetts and Canada to participate in a celebration of peace
and play peace games designed by the students.
   ``We have to change the mind frame of children,'' said Francelia
Butler, a UConn English professor and organizer of the event. ``We
have to make them look at tragedy and say `What can I do to resolve
this?'''
   Butler, 77, said she is tired of ``singing songs and holding
candles'' and other such demonstrations against world conflict. She
believes a more practical approach is changing the attitude of
tomorrow's peace makers.
   ``Glasnost has changed a lot of people's mind and peace is
possible,'' she said.
   The student-designed games had themes ranging from abortion to
environmental causes. One, called ``Tusk Mania,'' addressed the
plight of the endangered African elephant.
   The game board, designed by sixth graders, was in the shape of
Africa and the object was to get the elephant-shaped game pieces
safely to a sanctuary to avoid ivory poachers.
   In another game, entitled ``Peace With Nature,'' players were
penalized for bringing styrofoam cups to a picnic or for using
aerosol spray cans. But, if they donated money to save the rain
forest, they were awarded an extra turn.
   Butler said her students at UConn have been designing board
games for her classes for three years as a requirement of the
course. Some of those students went around the state to show the
younger children how to design a peace game.
   A successful peace game should feature conflict resolution,
where ``peace wins and war is averted,'' she said. Her students
turned in 11 games last semester on the Berlin Wall, including one
where for each correct trivia question answered, another brick
would be taken off the wall.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's presidential frontrunner said
Wednesday the United States must work harder at stopping the
narcotics trade and more vigorously prosecute drug suspects like
Washington Mayor Marion Barry.
   Cesar Gaviria, the only of four candidates in Sunday's election
to take a hard-line stand on Colombia's drug traffickers,
complained that Colombians are dying in the drug war while other
nations take only limited action.
   In a statement released Wednesday, Gaviria said the United
States and other industrial countries must take more
responsibility. He said other countries ``are not showing a serious
commitment to end this scourge'' of drug traffickers.
   He also called for increased economic aid to this violent-prone
South American country.
   ``The Colombian public does not understand why we should assume
the costs of the battle against drug trafficking and simultaneously
put up with discrimination against our export products,'' said
Gaviria. He said exports likes coffee and flowers should receive
preferential treatment.
   The drug trade has been a major issue in the election. Gaviria,
of the governing Liberal Party, has rejected negotiations with drug
traffickers. He has said he will continue extraditing U.S. drug
suspects.
   The other three candidates have all allowed the possibility of
some agreement with the traffickers to end the terror.
   Three more policemen were assassinated Wednesday in Medellin,
home to the world's most powerful cocaine cartel. Officials blame
drug traffickers for murdering 29 policemen there this month.
   Officials blame cocaine traffickers for killing more than 250
Colombians since August, when President Virgilio Barco launched a
U.S.-backed drug crackdown. Among the victims are three
presidential candidates, including the Liberal Party's previous
presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan.
   Despite U.S. aid, Gaviria said Wednesday, ``For us, it is
discouraging that Washington Mayor Marion Barry, caught using
drugs, continues to be free and seeking re-election.''
   Barry has been indicted on cocaine possession, conspiracy and
perjury charges, but his case has not yet come to trial. Barry
hasn't said if he will run again, but he has been making political
appearances.
   In another development Wednesday, the army said Colombia's
leftist guerrillas were stepping up attacks in advance of this
week's elections.
   Military spokesman Col. Eduardo Arevalo told The Associated
Press that the National Liberation Army on Tuesday kidnapped two
mayors, two mayors-elect, and three city councilmen in the
northwestern state of Antioquia.
   In addition, the rebels attacked a military checkpoint in
northern Colombia Tuesday night, killing at least two soldiers,
Arevalo said in the telephone interview.
   The Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo, citing military sources,
said the National Liberation Army and another insurgent group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, are planning to sabotage
presidential elections.
   Also Wednesday, the National Liberation Army bombed the
country's main oil pipeline near Samore, about 200 miles northeast
of Bogota, according to the state oil company Ecopetrol. It said
the bombing will temporarily prevent delivery of 230,000 barrels of
crude oil daily.

<HEAD>Romanian Prime Minister Wants Election Non-Violence Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov on
Wednesday criticized the opposition for refusing to sign a
non-violence pact before June 10 elections. His foes said the pact
ignores campaign problems they encountered.
   One called it a propaganda ploy.
   Lukanov was a major figure in the former Communist Party, now
called the Socialist Party.
   He said relations with the opposition to date had been
``civilized,'' referring in particular to the 16-party Union of
Democratic Forces, or UDF.
   But he alleged that a ``tendency'' existed in the opposition to
campaign using unethical means, and said if this increases, his
party may find itself unable to cooperate with the opposition after
the elections.
   The document was drafted at the initiative of President Petar
Mladenov and was to have beeen signed at a televised ceremony last
Monday by all parties contesting the elections.
   But UDF chairman Zhelyu Zhelev and others refused to sign. They
complained that the language of the agreement papers over the
obstruction, intimidation and even physical violence suffered by
the opposition during the campaign.
   Among accusations brought by Zhelev and the other UDF leaders
were falsification of electoral lists, violation of accords signed
during negotiations with the former Communists, and a virtual ban
on opposition campaigning in army barracks.
   UDF officials said their representatives were barred from
joining electoral commissions in many constituencies and that many
instances had occurred of physical attacks on opposition candidates.
   Among other organizations that refused to sign Mladenov's pact
were the Political Opposition Bloc, a grouping of 14
right-of-center and conservative parties, and the Alternative
Socialist Party, which broke away from the then Communist Party
after a party congress early this year.
   The Alternative Socialist Party is the fourth biggest party in
Bulgaria after the governing Socialists, the UDF, and the Agrarian
Party, once a docile ally of the Communists before longtime
strongman Todor Zhivkov was ousted last November.
   Alternative Socialist chairman Nikolai Vasilev told a news
conference Mladenov's propoosal was a propaganda move that ``may
hoodwink the public at home and abroad.''
   He termed the text of the agreement ``nonsense,'' since all its
clauses are already in the constitution.
   Vasilev said he could conceive of close cooperation with one of
the UDF parties after the elections, though not with the Socialist
Party.
   ``The ASP can easily imagine a broad social democratic bloc
which is led by Petar Dertliev,'' leader of the Social Democratic
Party, Vasilev said.
   He said if Dertliev ran for the presidency, the Alternative
Socialists would support him.

<TEXT>
   Police and NBC are investigating allegations that
a television station staged a fight between two pit bull terriers
for a report on illegal dog fights.
   KCNC-TV insists it received a videotape of the fight in the mail.
   The allegations arose from a four-part series on illegal dog
fights compiled by KCNC reporter Wendy Bergen and two video camera
operators. In Colorado, staging a dog fight or attending one is a
felony punishable by up to four years in prison and a maximum
$1,000 fine.
   One of the series of reports _ broadcast April 29 through May 2
during a ratings ``sweep'' period _ featured the fight between two
unmuzzled dogs that police say occurred on a grassy area near the
South Platte River in Sheridan, a Denver suburb.
   After the report, sources telephoned some competing Denver TV
stations and a newspaper with claims the fight was staged for KCNC
and that the station paid for it. Their reports identified the
sources only as current or former KCNC employees.
   KCNC general manager Roger Ogden on Wednesday denied the claims,
saying the station received unsolicited tape of the fight
anonymously in the mail.
   Investigations were launched by the Sheridan and Lakewood police
departments and the district attorney's offices in Arapahoe and
Jefferson counties.
   Sheridan is in Arapahoe County, and Lakewood, the hometown of a
man who allegedly owns one of the fighting pit bulls, is in
Jefferson County.
   ``We are close to concluding our investigation,'' Lakewood
police spokesman John Hunt said. ``We expect, within the next few
days perhaps, to have some sort of statement.''
   Ogden said an internal investigation is underway at the
NBC-affiliated station, and the network also is looking into the
matter, said NBC spokesman Richard Cutting in New York.
   The station has released edited tapes of the four-part series to
police. Police say they identified the owner of one of the pit
bulls involved, but declined to identify him.
   The tapes showed people at the dog fight, but their faces were
distorted to protect their identities, said Robin Duxbury,
executive director of the Rocky Mountain Humane Society.
   The organization has called for advertisers to boycott the
station until it releases the unedited versions of the tapes. KCNC
news director Marv Rockford declined to say whether the station
would release the tapes.
   The organization sent letters to businesses this week, asking
them to boycott KCNC, but it was too early to measure the effort's
success, she said.
   Ms. Bergen has declined to be interviewed.
   Ratings sweeps periods take place four times a year and are
crucial to local stations because they help determine local
advertising rates.
   The controversy heightened local debate over the pressure-cooker
effect of the sweeps on news operations.
   ``The staging of news is unethical, period,'' David Bartlett,
president of the Radio and Television News Directors Association,
said from Washington. He declined to speak specifically about the
Denver case until the investigations are completed.

   Elizabeth Taylor was significantly
improved in her seventh week of hospitalization for a near-fatal
bout of pneumonia, and her doctor said Wednesday the actress may go
home early next month.
   Dr. Michael Roth's prognosis shaved a couple of weeks off the
length of her anticipated hospital stay announced earlier this
month. Doctors said previously that Miss Taylor would remain at St.
John's Hospital and Health Center until late June.
   ``Her response to anti-fungal medicine has been very positive,''
Roth said. ``She is resting comfortably and her spirits are good.
   Miss Taylor, 58, was first hospitalized at Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital on April 9 with what was described as a sinus infection.
But her condition worsened and she was transferred to St. John's in
serious condition with viral pneumonia.
   She was placed on a respirator and intravenous medication and
doctors said she was near death on April 22. Miss Taylor rallied,
however, and was moved from the intensive care unit to a fourth
floor hospital suite early this month.

   Johnson Brothers Wholesale Liquor Co. decided on Monday to

Minnesota-made Karkov vodka. The liquor distributor said it wanted
to show respect for the Soviet president, scheduled to visit the
Twin Cities on June 3.
   The old billboards carried the caption, ``The Party's Over,'' a
reference to the Communist Party's problems. The new displays carry
a message in Russian above the words, in English, ``Karkov, the

   Some Minnesotans felt the old billboards, which went up before
Gorbachev's visit was announced, would offend the Soviet president.

   In San`a, people celebrated by dancing with daggers, as is the
tradition here, and chanting, ``One Yemeni nation, one Yemeni
army.''
   Women ululated as a sign of joy.
   In the south, celebrations were limited to official ceremonies,
including night parades at the city stadium, and there were no
major street celebrations.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, Jordan's King Hussein and Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein were among the first to telephone their
congratulations Tuesday to the new president, Gen. Ali Abdullah
Saleh. Saleh served as president of North Yemen the past 12 years.
   Newspapers around the Persian Gulf said the creation of the
united Republic of Yemen ``added strength to the Arab world.''
   Yemen is one of the poorest Arab nations, but it has newly
discovered oil reserves estimated unofficially at 2 billion barrels.
   Saleh declared the union of the pro-Western North Yemen with the
Soviet-allied South Yemen at noon Tuesday.
   South Yemen became the Arab world's only avowedly Marxist state
after it gained independence from Britain in 1971. But it began to
reform as democratic changes swept through the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   Scores of Cuban and East German military experts are said to
have left Aden, the capital of South Yemen in recent months.
   The merger bid has been outwardly promoted by oil-rich nations
on the Arabian Peninsula such as Saudi Arabia, which is eager to
snuff out Soviet influence.
   Aden has been designated as the commercial center of the new
state and North Yemen's capital of San`a has been declared the new
capital.
   Truckloads of cheering soldiers chanting ``unity is strength''
could be seen from time to time en route to Taiz, which is halfway
between San`a and Aden.
   The mountain resort is almost 150 miles from either major city
and has been selected as headquarters for the armed forces of the
united republic.

<HEAD>Skipper Acquitted of Criminal Liabilty in Destroyer's Collision</HEAD>

   The former skipper of the USS Kinkaid was
acquitted of criminal liability Wednesday in the collision of the
destroyer with a merchant ship off the Malay Peninsula, an accident
that killed one crewman.
   A military judge said the prosecution failed to prove charges of
negligence and dereliction of duty during Cmdr. John Cochrane's
court-martial, which lasted eight days.
   Cochrane, who was relieved of his command about a week after the
accident, smiled and embraced his attorneys, then his wife,
Suzanne, upon hearing the judge's verdict.
   ``I'm not bitter towards the Navy. I love the United States
Navy,'' he said afterwards. ``In the end I was exonerated, and it
proves the military justice system works.''
   The destroyer collided with a Panamanian-registered merchant
vessel in the Strait of Malacca, 240 miles northwest of Singapore,
on Nov. 12. The accident killed one crewman and injured five others.
   Lt. Tom Courtney, one of Cochrane's attorneys, said the case
should never have come to court-martial because the Navy had
assigned accountability to Cochrane for the accident by stripping
him of his command.
   The judge, Capt. Richard Reed, agreed, noting in his decision
that accountability traditionally assigned a Navy skipper for the
safe navigation of his ship and well-being of his crew differs from
criminal liability.
   ``The standards applied are significantly different,'' said
Reed, adding that criminal sanctions demand proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.
   Prosecutor Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Dickens left the courtroom
immediately after the verdict without comment. But Cmdr. Danny
Barrett, the chief Navy prosecutor in San Diego, said the verdict
changes very little.
   The defense attorney, Cmdr. Bayne Smith, said during his closing
argument earlier Wednesday that Cochrane should not be held
criminally liable for the failings of subordinates.
   ``A commanding officer cannot do everything hands on.
Ultimately, he must rely on his men to do their jobs and obey his
orders,'' Smith said.
   Dickens said in his closing argument that Cochrane's weak
management style and failure to follow established procedures led
to the accident in the heavily traveled Strait of Malacca.
   Cochrane was charged with failing to obey Navy instructions,
dereliction of duty and hazarding his vessel. He faced up to two
years confinement, loss of future pay, including his pension, and
dismissal from the Navy.
   The case arose from the collision of the San Diego-based Kinkaid
with the Panamanian-registered Kota Petani at 430-foot freighter.
The collision occurred in the dark, while the Kinkaid was on the
wrong side of the strait under an established traffic scheme.
   The accident killed Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, a navigator on
the ship, and injured five others. The Kinkaid was en route from
the Indian Ocean for a port call in Singapore.

   The government Wednesday rejected a
bailout of weak East German companies amid new signs that
unification may bring negative side effects to West Germans.
   Also Wednesday, the president of the East German parliament said
political unification could be complete by the end of the year.
   The two Germanys last week signed a treaty on joining their
economies. That merger is to take place July 2.
   However, West Germany's opposition Social Democrats charge that
the treaty should go further in protecting East German factories
and jobs and giving East German goods a fair chance of competing
with West German products.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has refused to change the
accord, known as the ``state treaty,'' but indicated a willingness
to negotiate new provisions.
   ``I am always ready for compromise, if compromise means
reasonable cooperation. But if it means renegotiating the state
treaty, my answer is a clear `no,''' Kohl said Wednesday. He said
he would meet with Social Democratic leader Hans-Jochen Vogel next
week.
   However, the government said it would not pump huge sums of
money into failing East German businesses.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said the opposition demands
would cost the West German government ``an additional burden of way
over 100 billion marks,'' the equivalent of $60 billion.
   He said measures will be taken to help East German businesses
survive the sudden immersion into capitalism, but he acknowledged
that some would collapse.
   ``It doesn't make sense to preserve uncompetitive operations
against market forces,'' said Haussmann. ``My course is: adaptation
yes, but artificial preservation, no.''
   However, the Social Democrats renewed their charge that too many
East German factories and jobs will become extinct after July 2.
   ``East Germany must not be turned into an extended supermarket
for West German goods,'' said West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, a
Social Democrat.
   At the same time, the Social Democrats softened their stand,
saying they won't try to delay the economic merger.
   Also Wednesday, a major utility company said West German
electrical capacity could be pushed to the limit if East Germans
become dependent on it.
   ``There could be huge problems if there is an especially harsh
winter,'' said Klaus Knizia, head of the United Electrical Works of
North Rhine-Westphalia state.
   East Germany, which uses air-fouling brown coal for heating, is
expected to switch to cleaner methods during the unification
process.
   West Germans also fear tax hikes and inflation as a result of
their aid to East Germans during unification.
   In Bonn on a visit, Parliament President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl of
East Germany said she ``could imagine'' the East German states
declaring themselves part of West Germany by the end of the year.
   Kohl, who is pushing for quick unification, has suggested joint
German elections in December.

<TEXT>
   The president of Colt's Manufacturing Co.
assailed a Senate vote Wednesday to outlaw some assault weapons as
a ``sad and dishonest effort'' to make voters think lawmakers are
fighting crime.
   A spokesman for Intratec in Miami, which makes one of the guns
on the proposed weapons hit list, was more optimistic.
   ``We've had proposals in the past and we really don't know what
the final outcome will be,'' said Mike Solo, national sales and
marketing director of Intratec. ``This of course doesn't look good
but it doesn't tell us where our future is.''
   The restrictions, which await final Senate action, would bar the
import of five foreign-made assault weapons and outlaw U.S.
manufacture of four others.
   The 52-48 vote came as a sharp defeat for the National Rifle
Association, which had lobbied to kill the curbs in the
wide-ranging bill. Law enforcement groups had called on the Senate
to support the restrictions.
   The Bush administration opposes the restrictions.
   Colt has said it no longer makes the AR-15, once the
best-selling semiautomatic rifle in the nation and one of the
weapons named in the omnibus crime bill.The bill also outlaws
production of the CAR-15, made by Colt.
   ``It is a sad and dishonest effort to make the public think the
politicians are actually doing something about crime,'' said
Richard F. Gamble, president of Colt's Manufacturing.
   ``In fact, rifles of any description are almost never used in
crimes and semiautomatic so-called `assault rifles' have been used
in less than three-hundredths of 1 percent of all crimes where a
gun was involved,'' Gamble said.
   He refused to comment Wednesday on what effect, if any, the ban
would have on Colt's Manufacturing.
   Colt Firearms, a division of Colt Industries, stopped production
of the AR-15 in 1989 shortly after Bush banned the importation of
similar weapons.
   Colt's new management has begun producing a weapon it calls the
Sporter which gun-control advocates contend is nearly identical to
the AR-15. The company maintains it is a different weapon, noting
it cannot be fitted with a bayonet and its magazine capacity is
only five rounds.
   The Sporter is sufficiently different from the AR-15 to be
unaffected by the bill, which listed specific models of weapons,
said Bob Maynes, press secretary to Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
a supporter of the ban.
   Intratec's Solo said the public would suffer most from the
restrictions. The Intratec Tec-9 was one of the guns targeted for
restrictions.
   ``It's just a shame the average Joe Citizen, whether it be a
plinker or a target shooter, gets muddied from the bad guys,'' Solo
said.
   The other domestic guns on the restricted list are the Street
Sweeper-Striker 12 and the MAC 10 and MAC 11.

<TEXT>
   A provincial court on Wednesday sentenced a
29-year-old man convicted of a series of rapes to 142 years in
prison, one of the stiffest sex-crime penalties in recent Spanish
history, sources said.
   But Francisco Javier Amedo, a former coalminer, can only serve a
maximum 30 years according to the Spanish constitution, which
places a maximum limit on imprisonment.
   The sentence came as feminist groups have stepped up protests
against sex crimes and rulings by conservative judges who have
imposed light sentences on rapists.
   There are no trials by jury in Spain.
   A three-judge court in this northern city found Amedo, married
with a young daughter, guilty of seven counts of rape and five
counts of sexual molestation.
   The trial gained national attention because of protests outside
the Oviedo courthouse by feminist groups demanding stiff sentences
for the rapist who terrorized women in the city from 1985 to 1988.
Police arrested Amedo in January 1989 after he was identified by
one of the victims.
   Amedo was described by the local press as ``the station rapist''
because all the attacks occurred near train and bus stations. He
received prison terms of 17 years and four months on each rape
count and four years and two months for each of five counts of
sexual molestation.
   During his trial Amedo denied any involvement in the attacks.
Nine victims testified against him saying they had been raped or
molested at knife point after accepting rides in his car.
   Women's groups praised the stiff sentence, saying it served as a
strong deterrent to sexual attacks.

<HEAD>Panel Says Study Needed Before Antibody Therapy Approved For AIDS
Babies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More research is needed before injections of
immunoglobulin blood cells are used generally to treat babies with
AIDS, a National Institutes of Health committee said Wednesday.
   The committee made the recommendation after studying the uses of
an treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIG,
which is becoming widely used for a variety of illnesses related to
the immune system.
   Dr. Peter E. Lipsky, the committee chairman and a professor at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said that
although IVIG has been reported in one limited study as useful in
treating newborns with AIDS, there have been no clinical trials to
prove its value.
   ``The treatment is unpleasant,'' said Lipsky. ``If it doesn't
afford much benefit, it doesn't make sense to subject them to this
expensive treatment.''
   Clinical trials are now underway, the committee said, to
determine if the IVIG therapy can help babies born with AIDS to
develop natural defenses against disease.
   The panel was organized to establish a medical consensus for the
uses of IVIG. The immunoglobulin therapy has been approved to treat
some types of immune deficiency diseases, but experimental uses
have developed what Lipsky called ``anecdotal evidence'' that IVIG
may be useful in treating other illnesses.
   Immunoglobulin is the antibody component of human blood.
Antibodies are disease-fighting proteins made by the body's immune
system. Antibodies will attack any bacteria, virus, tissue, cell or
substance that that appear foreign to the host body.
   Doctors have used human antibody shots for years to protect
patients from a variety of infections or to boost a patient's
immune system. But the shots are very painful and, as a result,
were used only when no other therapy was available.
   In the 1980s, however, pharmaceutical companies developed a way
to process immunoglobulin so that it can be injected into veins.
This is far less painful and enables doctors to use massive amounts.
   Lipsky said the new treatment had such a dramatic effect on
patients with immune problems that many doctors began using IVIG to
treat other conditions.
   ``The enthusiasm has caused there to be lots of therapeutic
adventurism,'' said Lipsky. He said the NIH committee was
established to determine which of the new treatments actually work.
   The committee recommended that IVIG continue to be used for
patients whose immune systems do not create natural antibodies, a
condition called primary immunodeficiency.
   IVIG is also appropriate, the committee said, for reducing
infection among patients who have received bone marrow transplants
or who have chronic lymphatic leukemia.
   The committee said IVIG also has been shown effective among
children who develop Kawasaki syndrome, an inflammatory disease
that often causes heart disease.
   Lipsky said that though there have been limited examples of IVIG
preventing infection among premature babies and relieving symptoms
of such disorders as arthritis or brain seizures, the committee
could not recommend IVIG for those uses until further study is done.
   Seven companies now produce IVIG, but Lipsky said the therapy
continues to be very expensive. IVIG treatment for some patients
with chronic immune system problems may cost up to $5,000 monthly,
he said.

   About half of the American voters questioned for
a poll released Wednesday said the federal government should
increase taxes to reduce the nation's budget deficit.
   The survey of 1,000 registered voters conducted for NBC News and
The Wall Street Journal found 51 percent favoring higher taxes and
42 opposed. A similar survey last month found only 39 percent in
favor of raising taxes, NBC said.
   If taxes do go up, 36 percent said they would blame the
administration of former President Ronald Reagan and 30 percent
would blame Democrats in Congress. Only 16 percent said they would
lay the blame on President Bush's administration.
   The survey was conducted May 18-22 and had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percent.

   The army sealed a road to a rebel
base on Wednesday after a soldier defected to the insurgents with
an unspecified amount of weapons, the military said.
   The army identified the defector only as ``Sgt. Woodley'' and
claimed the rebels bribed him with drugs or gold.
   But a man identifying himself as ``Woodley'' told state radio he
had gone over to the rebel forces voluntarily because the army is
``frustrating the peace process.''
   The Jungle Commando rebels has been waging an on-again-off-again
guerrilla war on behalf of the country's Bush Negro minority for
nearly four years. They are believed to number 200 to 400 men.
   The army sealed off a road to a Jungle Commando guerrilla camp
near the mining town of Moengo in eastern Suriname after the
defection.
   The army said it took the action ``due to the increasingly
insecure situation in the eastern part of Suriname.''
   Suriname is a former Dutch colony on the northern shoulder of
South America. It has 400,000 residents.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Wednesday acknowledged a safety problem with U.S. nuclear artillery
shells in Europe but said it was fixed and there never was a risk
of accidental nuclear explosions.
   In 1988, he said, officials found that the W-79 howitzer shells
did not meet minimum safety standards. ``The necessary steps were
taken to assure (it) does meet our very high safety standards
today,'' Cheney said.
   The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the United States
was repairing artillery shells and examining the design of two
kinds of missiles because of the risk of an accidental nuclear
explosion.
   Responding to the story, Cheney told reporters: ``It is
important here not to over-dramatize the nature of the problem. I
will simply say that ... there was no danger, but that the shells
in question did not meet the very high standards that we have. I
don't believe there was any cause for concern.''
   He declined to go into details of what was done to correct the
problems, saying such matters are classified. He spoke after a
two-day NATO defense ministers' meeting.
   The bulk of U.S. nuclear shells are in West Germany, with the
remainder stockpiled in the Netherlands and Italy.
   Cheney said the West German government was told ``we had
identified the problem and that we had solved the problem.''
   Speaking at a separate news conference in Brussels, West
Germany's defense minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, confirmed this but
said his government was not told what was wrong with the shells.
   He said this was normal. In the past, he said, U.S. officials
have informed Bonn of ``modifications'' to U.S. nuclear arms on
German soil without detailing the modifications.
   He said U.S. officials have said there was ``at no point in time
any danger'' to either personnel or the environment, Stoltenberg
said.
   In the Netherlands, where some U.S. nuclear weapons are based, a
Dutch Defense Ministry spokesman said: ``We are always informed
when the Americans are planning maintenance'' on nuclear weapons
there.
   The spokesman, Martijn Verbrugge, would not say when, or if,
Dutch officials were told about problems with the nuclear shells.
   The Washington Post said U.S. troops in Europe were warned not
to move the shells until they were fixed.
   The problem with the W-79 shell was one of three found recently
by Energy Department experts, it said.
   A special committee will review the W-88 warhead on the new
seaborne D-5 missile, the Post said. And it said special flight
restrictions have been instituted pending review of the W-69
warhead on the short-range SRAM-A missile carried by some bomber
aircraft.
   The two warheads use the same volatile fuel that experts feared
could explode in certain accidents and set off the conventional
explosives that trigger the nuclear ones.
   Those conventional explosives surround a mass of plutonium and
compress it from all sides to the point where the nuclear chain
reaction begins, causing a nuclear explosion in a split second.
   John C. Tuck, an acting assistant secretary at the Department of
Energy, told a congressional subcommittee Wednesday that his agency
``is satisfied'' that the W-79 howitzer warhead is safe. He said
the W-88, a Trident missile warhead, ``is a safe warhead'' as well.
   However, he said the W-69 may be removed from alert-status
aircraft and stored until actually needed.
   Stanford University physicist Sidney D. Drell, who has been
named to a subcommittee panel with two other outside physicists to
study the safety of U.S. nuclear weapons, said Wednesday, ``I don't
think there is any question of coverup or negligence.''
   ``They just wanted to appoint three of us with some experience
to give our best technical judgment about what's being done and how
it's being done and whether it's appropriate.''
   In the telephone interview from his New York office, he said he
expected the panel to start work this summer. He said he was
uncertain how long its studies would take.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he believed a nuclear war would more likely result
from an accident or safety problem than from a deliberate attack.
   He said the United States should enter into an accord with the
Soviet Union for a ``thorough and fail-safe review'' of nuclear
safety.
   The artillery shell problem was discovered by special computer
studies in 1988, the Post said.
   It said these raised the possibility that a bullet striking the
conventional explosive could set off part of it, dispersing the
highly toxic plutonium, though not necessarily causing a chain
reaction.
   But if the bullet hit while the shells were in the artillery
piece, the barrel of the weapon might reflect neutrons back into
the plutonium to cause a nuclear explosion, according to experts
questioned by the Post.
   The W-88 was feared to be vulnerable to an accidental nuclear
explosion, but the W-69 threat was dispersal of plutonium, the
paper said.
   An unidentified senior military official was quoted as saying,
``For a while, we were worried that these things might go off if
they fell off the back of a truck and landed in a certain way.''
   Special teams early in 1989 installed ``safing mechanisms,'' and
the shells are being modified, the Post said.

<HEAD>Mexican Police Seize Tons of Marijuana, Cocaine in Tunnel Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal police seized more than a ton of
cocaine and 14 tons of marijuana Wednesday after a shootout in the
town where a tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the Arizona border
was discovered last week, authorities said.
   A communique from the Attorney General's Office said the drugs
belonged to the man identified as the owner of a house at one end
of the tunnel in Agua Prieta, Sonora.
   Two people began firing when they saw the federal anti-narcotics
agents and then fled in a vehicle, the statement said.
   It was not immediately reported if anyone was injured.
   Roads in Sonora state were closed and U.S. authorities were
notified to be on the watch for the two fugitives.
   The marijuana and 2,330 pounds of cocaine were found in a
warehouse in Agua Prieta, across from Douglas, Ariz., which was
supposed to contain disposable diapers.
   ``It has been determined that the drug confiscated belongs to
Rafael Camarena Macias, owner of the house where ... Federal
Judicial Anti-narcotics Police found a tunnel about 200 yards
long,'' the statement said.
   It said the warehouse was equipped with a hydraulic system for
raising and lowering a platform where the drugs were found.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities using jackhammers and blowtorches
broke into the tunnel last week and found about 25 pounds of
marijuana, officials in both countries said.
   The officials said then that the tunnel leads from the Agua
Prieta house north to a Douglas Building Supply Co. warehouse, also
belonging to Camarena.
   The tunnel was built eight months ago and is one block from the
Customs enforcement building and four blocks from the international
port of entry.
   Equipped with storage areas for up to five tons of drugs, it was
five feet high, four feet wide and lighted.
   U.S. customs agents estimated it was used to smuggle at least a
ton of cocaine into the United States.

<HEAD>Honus Wagner Card Raises Collectors' Doubts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball card experts raised doubts
Wednesday about the authenticity of a Honus Wagner baseball card
that turned up in this central Maine town.
   An authentic card in good condition featuring the Hall of Fame
shortstop from the early 1900s could be worth $10,000 to more than
$100,000, according to card shop dealers.
   Arlo Quint, 12, said he unearthed the Wagner card and three
others while digging for worms in his back yard Monday. The cards
were in an old tooth powder can, Quint said.
   The Wagner card surfaced only about a month after a boy in
Stockton Springs, about 30 miles away, found a what was said to be
Honus Wagner card under similar circumstances.
   The similarity of the discoveries almost immediately sparked
doubts about Quint's find.
   Bob Thing, an area man who has been collecting cards for 40
years, inspected Quint's card Wednesday.
   He said the paper on which the Wagner card is printed appears to
be thinner than it would be on an original, and the ink colors
appeared wrong. He also noted that the lower portion of the card,
where reproductions printed in later years would have been marked
as a reprint, was missing.
   Baseball card authority Lew Lipset in New York, who hadn't seen
the card, said Honus Wagner cards are so rare that a find would be
extremely unlikely.
   He said it is believed that all of the original Honus Wagner
cards remaining, with perhaps one exception, were issued by Sweet
Caporal cigarettes. However, Quint's card is marked as a Piedmont
cigarette issue.

<HEAD>Chinese Revolutionary Leader Granted Political Asylum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese student who was one of
the leaders of last year's student protest in Tiananmen Square has
been granted political asylum in the United States.
   ``I am not giving up my country, but I have to do this,'' said
Yin Ping Zhang, 20, wiping away tears at a news conference
Wednesday.
   ``I love my country. I love my motherland. But they won't allow
me to stay there. I am a woman who cannot return. I can't go
back,'' she said.
   Zhang fled to the United States in August. Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., intervened when he found out Zhang's tourist visa was
expiring and she might be forced to return to China. She learned
this week that her request for asylum had been granted.
   ``Yin Ping Zhang is a genuine hero,'' Wirth said. ``Living in a
free country, it is difficult to comprehend the courage and bravery
that people such as Yin Ping exemplify. Yin Ping put her life on
the line because she wanted to be free, and because she wanted her
people to be free.
   ``This week, she received her freedom. It's sad that Yin Ping
had to leave home to be free. It is wonderful, though, that she
could come to the United States and be free.''
   Zhang was a student at Beijing Foreign Studies University when
she met her American sponsor, Rosemarie Montoya, an English teacher.
   When the revolution erupted in shooting and executions in June
1989, Montoya encouraged Zhang to flee.
   Zhang tried to get a passport, and was picked up for questioning
by police three times. Zhang decided to flee, got a passport that
was mistakenly issued by an inexperienced clerk and managed to get
on a plane to the United States on Aug. 14 before police returned
to pick her up, Wirth said.
   Zhang said one of her friends was shot in the leg during the
massacre, and she feared for her life.
   Zhang said she asked another friend, a soldier in the Chinese
army, why he was shooting students.
   ``He said, `We have to, because if we don't shoot them, my
leader will shoot me. They tell me I can shoot anybody I want, and
nobody will punish me,''' she said.
   Zhang also said life has not been easy during her brief time in
the United States.
   Her sponsor wanted to take her to San Francisco to be near
Chinese friends, but their car broke down and they ran out of money
in Colorado Springs, and had to seek temporary housing.
   ``We don't even have the money to find food, and Rosie can't
find a job,'' she said. ``I want to help her do something. I want
to support myself.''
   Zhang said she wants to study to become a doctor, to return the
help she has received from the United States.
   But she also said it is hard to be happy after the events of the
past two years.
   ``I lost my country, my education, my family,'' she said.
   ``Sometimes I feel very sad.''

<HEAD>Colditz Castle Escapee Maj. Patrick Reid Dead at 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maj. Patrick Reid, the British World War II
officer who escaped from Colditz Castle, a supposedly impregnable
Nazi prison camp, has died, an official said Thursday. He was 79.
   Kenneth Lockwood, secretary of the Colditz Association, said
Reid died Tuesday at Bristol's Frenchay Hospital after a short
illness.
   Reid was taken to the supposedly impregnable 17th century
Colditz Castle in 1940 after six attempts to escape from other
prisons.
   In 1942, Reid and Lt. Cmdr. Billy Stephens, disguised as French
workmen, used a smuggled saw to cut through window bars and sneaked
out of the prison through a sewer that led into the castle's moat.
They eventually escaped by train to Switzerland.
   Lockwood said Reid was constantly trying to discover new ways to
break out during his two-year imprisonment at Colditz Castle, which
overlooks the Mulde River near Leipzig.
   ``He was a very, very good escaper. He was full of ideas, escape
was always uppermost in his mind,'' Lockwood said. ``He was always
willing, before he got away himself, to help anybody else with
their escape.''
   Reid's book, ``The Colditz Story,'' was published in 1953 and
was made into a film and a British television series.
   Reid set up a building company after the war and lectured on his
wartime experiences. Recently, he worked as a planning consultant
to East Germany's tourism bureau on the modification of Colditz
into a museum.
   He was made a Member of the British Empire in 1940 and awarded
the Military Cross in 1943 for gallant and distinguished services.
   Reid is survived by his wife, Nicandra, and by three sons and
two daughters from a previous marriage to Jane Cabot.

   The remains of three U.S. warplanes
believed to have crashed during World War II were found at a remote
Indonesian island, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The daily Pos Kota said the wreckage was found at Biak Island in
the easternmost province of Irian Jaya, about 2,100 miles northeast
of Jakarta.
   It quoted a local leader, Dorus Rumbiak, as saying the three
planes were found separately _ two in forests and the other about

   The paper did not say if any human remains were discovered, and
it did not provide details on the type of planes.

<HEAD>City University To Sell its Tobacco Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City University of New York voted to sell its
stock in cigarette companies, a move recently completed by Harvard
University.
   The moves come at a time tobacco companies are under increasing
public pressure over the health risks their products pose. Critics
have focused on advertising they maintain is intended to persuade
the young and uneducated to take up smoking, and on efforts to
boost tobacco exports.
   The City University of New York policy was adopted Monday at a
regular board meeting.
   ``The policy is that the university will divest itself of its
stocks in companies that manufacture cigarettes,'' said Rita Rodin,
a spokeswoman for CUNY on Wednesday. ``They will do it in a way
that will not adversely affect the university's portfolio.''
   Harvard officials decided to sell the stocks last September and
completed the sales in March, according to Harvard President Derek
Bok.
   He revealed the sale May 18 in a letter to three Harvard School
of Public Health students, who had been demanding the university
sell its investments in companies manufacturing cigarettes.
   ``In reaching its decision, the corporation was motivated by a
desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged
in significant sales of products that create a substantial and
unjustified risk of harm to other human beings,'' Bok wrote.
   Dr. Allan Blum, a Houston physician and chairman of Doctors
Ought To Care, a national anti-smoking group that pushes for
divestment of tobacco stocks, called Harvard's decision a
``breakthrough morally and financially.''
   Sara Ridgway, vice president of public affairs for the Lorillard
Tobacco Co., said the decision may deprive Harvard of profitable
stock investments.

<TEXT>
   The last four ethnic Albanians in
the government of Serbian's restive province of Kosovo resigned on
Wednesday, Tanjug reported. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of
the population there.
   The government now consists of four Serbs, a Montenegrin and a
Moslem. Moslems are considered a separate nationality in Yugoslavia.
   The official Yugoslav news agency announced the resignations on
the second day of a stormy Kosovo parliament session called to
discuss the resignations of Prime Minister Jusuf Zeinulahu and six
other ethnic Albanians, submitted a month ago.
   The provincial parliament also was supposed to debate what the
Belgrade daily Politika called ``the catastrophic situation in
economy, education, health service and internal affairs'' in the
province.
   The ethnic Albanians resigned to protest the Serbian Communist
leadership's increasing control over Kosovo, where 60 ethnic
Albanians have died in anti-Serbian riots since February 1989.
   The ethnic Albanians seek restoration of the broader autonomy
they enjoyed under a 1974 constitution that was amended in March
1989. Serbia said the changes were needed to protect the Slav
minority in Kosovo from alleged harassment by ethnic Albanians.
   The Serbian parliament on Wednesday adopted unspecified new
powers to amend measures passed by Kosovo's administration in a
further extension of Serbian control.
   Serbia's actions in Kosovo have drawn international allegations
of human rights violations.
   Serbia is the only one of Yugoslavia's six republics not to have
legalized opposition parties. Its Communist leaders have failed to
schedule any talks with the burgeoning Albanian opposition
movements in Kosovo.
   Also on Wednesday, the new center-right coalition government of
the Slovenian republic announced plans to shut down Yugoslavia's
first and only nuclear power plant at Krsko by 1995, according to
the Slovenian daily Delo.
   The government took power from communists this spring after
Yugoslavia's first free elections in 50 years.
   The station has been plagued by malfunctions. Slovenian
environmentalists have campaigned for the plant to be closed and
neighboring Austria has repeatedly expressed concern about the
plant's safety.
   The 632-megawatt Krsko plant was a joint Slovenian-Croatian
project and the Slovenian decision requires consent from Croatia.
   Ecologists claim the station does not meet safety standards.
   It was commissioned in 1981.

   Fiji on Wednesday ordered India to close its
embassy in Suva and told the Indian charge d'affaires to leave
within 24 hours.
   The announcement by Fiji's ministry of foreign affairs also
ordered all Indian Embassy staff to leave within two weeks.
   In New Delhi, India's government said it would not comment on
the move.
   A government statement said the embassy was ordered closed
because the Indian government was conducting an ``unwarranted and
unacceptable international campaign against Fiji and was similarly
blocking Fiji's re-admission into the Commonwealth.''
   Earlier this month, the Indian government said it would conduct
an international campaign against Fiji to protest what it called
``political discrimination'' against Indians born in Fiji.
   Relations between India and Fiji have been strained since 1987
when the first of two racially inspired coups by the predominately
ethnic Fijian army ousted the Indian-dominated coalition government
that had been elected only weeks earlier.
   Fiji was expelled from the Commonwealth as a result of the coup
and India has said it will oppose Fiji's re-entry as long as the
country discriminates against its Indian population.
   Indians make up nearly one-half of the 720,000 people on the
South Pacific island.
   In October, Fiji expelled India's ambassador, Thettalil
Sreenivassan, claiming he had interfered in local affairs.
Sreenivassan had made public comments after ethnic Fijian
Methodists burned four Indian places of worship in the city of
Lautoka.
   Fiji refused to permit India to replace Sreenivassen and the
Indian Embassy has been headed by charge d'affaires Vidya Bhusan
Soni.
   Fiji's interim government has said a constitution that would
give ethnic Fijians a guaranteed majority in a new bicameral
parliament would be the best way to restore parliamentary rule.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration for now has backed
away from its insistence on limiting the ammunition capacity of
semiautomatic assault weapons, the White House acknowledged
Wednesday.
   President Bush, as part of his anti-crime package, last year
proposed a ban for private citizens on gun magazines of more than
15 rounds. But now he supports legislation by Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., that doesn't include that ban, said White House spokeswoman
Alixe Glen.
   ``It's better to support a bill that gives us nine-tenths of our
goal rather than go without any reforms,'' she said.
   Glen said Bush still supports restricting magazine capacity.
   Another White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the White House would try to get the provision into
the House version of the crime legislation when the Senate bill
reaches the House.
   Bush opposes the Senate Democratic-backed anti-crime package.
The wide-ranging bill would, among other things, restore capital
punishment for 30 federal crimes including presidential
assassination and overhaul the way courts review the
constitutionality of criminal trials.
   Bush suffered a defeat when senators voted 52-48 Wednesday to
retain a ban on the manufacture of four types of semiautomatic
weapons. They also upheld a ban on imports, which Bush has already
put into effect.
   There is no similar bill on the House calendar.
   While banning imported semiautomatics, Bush has refused to act
against the manufacture and sale of similar domestic models,
contending some are used for sport.
   Bush has threatened to veto the Democratic-backed crime bill,
which is a vastly revamped version of the package he sent to
Capitol Hill last year. Thurmond's package incorporates many of the
proposals Bush made, but not his ban on ammunition capacity.
   Bush proposed a prohibition on the importation, sale or
manufacture of gun magazines of more than 15 rounds as a way of
curtailing use of military-style guns whose deadliness is enhanced
by the ability to fire many bullets before reloading.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Imelda Marcos Associates Helped Hide Properties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian lawyer testified Wednesday his firm
was asked by associates of Imelda Marcos to fabricate documents
showing that companies they secretly controlled were owned instead
by financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   The attorney, Jaime Arias, said he refused because the request
``did not correctly reflect the situation.'' But in the end, he
said, his firm agreed to handle a document that was notarized with
a phony date.
   Arias testified as the government sought to show how Bienvenido
Tantoco and his wife, Gliceria, intimates of the former Philippine
first lady, tried to keep the companies from falling into the hands
of President Corazon Aquino's government after it took power in
Manila in 1986.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband, former
President Ferdinand Marcos, embezzle more than $220 million from
their country's treasury to secretly buy four New York properties
and artwork.
   The prosecution alleges that Khashoggi agreed to falsely claim
ownership of all the properties as a favor to the Marcoses.
   Tantoco, a one-time Philippine ambassador to the Vatican, and
his wife also were named as co-conspirators in the 1988 indictment,
but are fugitives. Mrs. Tantoco was owner of Manila's leading
department store and widely regarded as Mrs. Marcos' closest friend.
   Under stern cross examination by Khashoggi attorney James Linn,
Arias acknowledged that he originally was indicted as well, but
that the government dropped the charges of mail fraud and
obstruction of justice in exchange for his cooperation.
   In reply to defense questions, he said that to his knowledge
neither Khashoggi nor Mrs. Marcos had any direct role in the
discussions to falsify the documents.
   The government says the offshore companies, located in the
Netherlands Antilles and the British Virgin Islands, were part of a
network of shell companies set up by the Marcoses to conceal their
ownership of the four New York properties and other financial
dealings.
   Arias said his law firm assumed power of attorney for the New
York properties in 1985, replacing a New York firm with whom the
Tantocos were feuding. Shortly after the Marcos government fell in
February 1986, he said, he met with the Tantoncos in Rome to
discuss a new crisis _ an Aquino government move to seize all
Marcos holdings including the New York properties.
   ``They were worried about the impact of New York legal
proceedings on their Philippines business and assets. If the
companies were known to be theirs, it could have a negative impact
under (the Philippines) monetary and tax laws,'' Arias said.
   Arias said Mrs. Tantoco came up with the name of Khashoggi, a
friend of the Marcoses, ``as someone who might be able to help'' if
he would allow himself to be identified as the ``beneficial owner''
of the properties.
   The lawyer said an agreement to this effect was reached in May
1986 after meetings between the Tantocos and Karl Bock Peterson, an
aide to Khashoggi, in Panama City.
   The Saudi financier was not present, he said, but some documents
brought by Peterson bore the initials ``A.K.'' along with some
proposed changes in dates that would make it appear that Khashoggi
had ``organized and managed'' the companies from 1981 on.
   James Linn, Khashoggi's attorney, did not object to the
documents being introduced as evidence by the prosecution, but
asked U.S. District Court Judge John F. Keenan to instruct jurors
that they were only ``drafts'' and ``not documents executed by Mr.
Khashoggi.''

<HEAD>Hungary's New Leader Firm on Leaving Soviet Alliance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall was sworn
in Wednesday as chief of Hungary's first democratically elected
government in 43 years and said again he intends to pull the
country out of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   He also defended the ``Program of National Rebirth'' he
presented to Parliament the day before, which calls for halting
inflation; creating a broad social safety net of welfare services;
and changing over education and health services, while transforming
Hungary's socialist economy into a market economy.
   Critics complained in debate prior to Antall's winning a vote of
confidence that he was vague about how to carry out the changes and
how to pay for them.
   Viktor Orban, leader of the League of Young Democrats'
parliamentary faction, called Antall's program ``a loosely
collected wish list.''
   Katalin Bossanyi, a Socialist Party lawmaker, said she consulted
experts and ``in their view, the program would require an
additional $3.2 billion in the budget.''
   Antall retorted, ``It is easy to give advice, but the
responsibility of governing rests upon our shoulders.''
   But he promised the opposition parties their criticism will be
heeded when it comes to spelling out details.
   Antall promised the deputies ``this program, which we view as a
guideline, will be replaced by a detailed program within three
months, by which time we shall have had a chance to assess the
concrete situation.''
   The 58-year-old politician-historian said Hungarian officials
will soon start negotiations on leaving the seven-nation Warsaw
Pact military alliance since ``the agreement cannot be unilaterally
abandoned.''
   ``Hungary wants to leave the Warsaw Pact because the pact is not
suitable for guaranteeing anything to Hungary,'' Antall said.
   Other Pact members are the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania.
   Antall stressed that withdrawal would come in the context of new
security arrangements for all of Europe.
   He said he hoped Hungary could join the European Community in
the next decade.
   The Communist Party, which long ruled Hungary, reshaped itself
in advance of the elections in March and April, but was
overwhelmingly defeated.
   Antall's Hungarian Democratic Forum has 165 seats in the
386-seat Parliament, and its coalition partners the Independent
Smallholders' and the Christian Democrats 44 and 21 seats
respectively.
   The new prime minister told Parliament his government intends to
``dismantle the system of repression ... (and) inaugurate the
system of liberty.''
   His new government faces serious economic problems. The annual
inflation rate is in double digits, unemployment is rising and
Hungary has a $20 billion foreign debt, the highest per capita in
Eastern Europe.

   Under dark and cloudy skies, 15
solar-powered racers hummed off the Statehouse lawn Wednesday on
the first leg of a Vermont-to-Massachusetts road rally.
   Sounding more like golf carts than race cars, the solar electric
vehicles whooshed away after Gov. Madeleine Kunin waved a green
flag to begin the second annual American Tour de Sol.
   The race winds its way through Vermont and New Hampshire before
ending Sunday at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. The 234-mile
race is organized by the Northeast Solar Energy Association.
   Despite another day of dark, cloudy skies, the racers said there
was enough daylight to recharge their batteries.
   ``It's been sucking up some energy,'' Gregory Halverson, a
junior at Conval High School in Peterborough, N.H., said of his
car's solar panels. ``As long as there's some light, we're getting
some energy.''
   ``This is happening because of people's concerns about the
environment, air pollution in cities, and the limitation of fossil
fuels,'' said Nancy Hazard, the group's associate director. ``It's
really positive and encouraging to see people excited and
interested about the technology.''
   The cars in the race are either fully or partially powered by
sunlight. The bodies are lined with photovoltaic cells, or solar
panels, which capture sunlight, convert it to electricity and then
store it in a bank of ordinary car batteries.
   These batteries can also be charged by plugging them into
electrical outlets or other solar panels.
   Solar electric cars are environmentally safer than
gasoline-burning cars because they do not give off any exhaust
pollution, Hazard said. The burning of fossil fuels is blamed for
creating one-third of the greenhouse gases.
   Entrants in the race came from California, Florida,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Vermont.
   After stopping over in Fairlee on Wednesday night, the racers
will travel another 39 miles to Canaan, N.H., Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A senior Indian official Wednesday rejected
a Pakistani call for a plebiscite in Indian-controlled Kashir on
the future of the region wracked by secessionist violence.
   ``As fas as Kashmir is concerned, I still maintain it is an
insurgency, and we can deal with it,'' said George Fernandes,
India's minister for Pakistani affairs.
   Fernandes, in Cairo for a meeting of the Socialist
International, spoke to reporters at a news conference.
   His remarks came four days after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
of Pakistan, also visiting Cairo on a regional tour, said her
country would support Kashmir's independence ``no matter what the
consequences.''
   She said her government backed a plebiscite among Kashmiris and
talks to end the Moslem separatist movement.
   The revolt in Indian Kashmir, in the far north on the Pakistani
border, has left 400 people dead since January. On Monday, Indian
forces killed 58 separatists during a funeral for a slain Moslem
leader of Kashmir.
   Fernandes repeated previous Indian charges that Pakistan trains
and arms the Moslem militants. Pakistan has denied the charge and
accused India of a bloody crackdown in the region.
   Kashmir is Hindu Indian's only mainly Moslem region. Pakistan is
predominantly Moslem.
   India and Pakistan fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965.
   Though he insisted Wednesday that the issue is an internal
Indian matter, Fernandes also said, ``We do not want to see another
war; we will go to any length to see that the issue is resolved.''

   Floods from torrential rains three
weeks ago 200 miles to the north pushed the Trinity River toward a
crest Wednesday in Liberty, the last sizeable Texas city before the
Gulf of Mexico.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials began distributing
relief funds to flood victims in the Livingston area, 50 miles
north of Liberty.
   ``Everything I've got is under water. I can't even find my
house,'' said Joe Tomlinson, 35, of Goodrich, just south of
Livingston. He was applying for federal aid.
   An estimated 10,000 Texans have been forced from their homes by
flooding, Laureen Chernow of the Texas Division of Emergency
Management said. Forty-one Texas counties are eligible for disaster
assistance.
   Elsewhere, flood waters started to recede in southern Indiana,
and Louisiana officials said flooding there wasn't as bad as
expected, causing about $10 million damage to farms.
   In Arkansas, tourism officials assured travelers that holiday
weekend visits to state parks shouldn't be cancelled for fear of
flood damage. They stressed that the weekend's flash flooding,
while serious in some places, was localized.
   In Texas, federal and state officials in Livingston and Liberty
briefed local agencies about programs available to people displaced
by the floods.
   The Trinity River was expected to crest in Liberty at 30 feet,
six feet above flood level and one foot higher than a record set in
1942, the Trinity River Authority said.
   Liberty is about 16 miles from the Trinity Bay which feeds into
Galveston Bay and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``I think we're getting the worst of it now,'' said Jim Mitchum,
Liberty County Emergency Management coordinator.
   Water from rain-swollen Lake Livingston has been funneling at
record levels through a 208-square mile area downstream, but the
amount of water released from the lake's dam dropped for a third
straight day Wednesday.
   Liberty city employees and volunteers continued a two-week-old
effort to shore up a mile-long levee protecting high-priced
lakefront homes.
   ``But as soon as we get one low spot fixed, the waters seem to
come over someplace else,'' Liberty City Secretary Beth Staton said.
   In Livingston, officials said it is too early to determine the
extent of flood damage.
   ``One problem here is that the water is still up and we can't
get in to inspect,'' said Graham Nance of FEMA.
   About $1 million in federal money already has been distributed.
   Nance said flood victims should be able to get federal checks
within four to six days. The agency had received 3,800 applications
for help, he said.
   In southern Indiana, the east fork of the White River continued
to spill over its banks from Petersburg to the Indiana-Illinois
state line, the National Weather Service said. At the Indiana Route
57 bridge, the river was more than 1{ miles wide.
   The Wabash River along Interstate 64 stretched from Graysville,
Ill., to near Griffin, Ind. _ nearly 3 miles wide. Water covered
much of western Gibson County, the weather service said.
   More than 10,000 people in Pike and Gibson counties remained
without drinking water, which was lost Saturday when the White
River tore through a section of levee and burst the town's main
water line.
   In central Louisiana, Farm Bureau president Ronnie Anderson said
that more than 100,000 acres of cropland have been flooded and more
are expected to go under.
   ``There's no doubt that this can be considered a disaster and
we're going to ask Congress, as well as Secretary of Agriculture
Clayton Yeutter, to declare it so,'' Anderson said.
   But Arkansas tourism officials sought to downplay reports about
flood damage.
   ``I think a lot of people are taking it that the whole state is
under water,'' said Richard Davies, interim state Parks and Tourism
Department chief,
   Flash flooding occurred Saturday night in Hot Springs _ one of
the state's top tourist areas _ but the water was gone 24 hours
later. Much of the flooding earlier along the Arkansas and Red
rivers involved farmland.
   Joe Rice, state tourism director, said employees in Little Rock
have fielded about 200 calls a day from tour operators and
potential tourists. People want to know if they should cancel their
holiday weekend plans at state and national parks because of
flooding, Davies said.
   ``I've never seen it like this,'' he said. ``We're trying to get
the word out that flooding is localized. That's not to say that
some places weren't hit hard, they were; but others are completely
unaffected.''

   The House voiced strong disagreement with
current U.S. policy toward El Salvador in a largely symbolic vote
to slap sharp restrictions on military aid to the Central American
country.
   But moments after Tuesday's 250-163 vote on that issue, the
lawmakers reversed course and voted to kill the bill to which the
aid curbs had been attached.
   Despite the murkiness of the situation, it was apparent that a
solid majority in the chamber believes continued human rights
violations by the Salvadoran military dictate an end to what some
have called a ``blank check'' policy.
   ``The American people and the American Congress have been played
for fools'' by the military and by extremists on both the left and
right in El Salvador, said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., a sponsor of
the aid restrictions. ``This must end and it must end now.''

   Standardized tests should be prohibited at all
elementary schools and severely curtailed at colleges and on the
job, a commission said today.
   The National Commission on Testing and Public Policy released a
highly critical study of standardized, multiple-choice tests and
called for a restructuring of educational and employment testing so
that the talents of all Americans are promoted.
   ``We recognize that in the past some tests have been a positive
force for numerous individuals and institutions,'' the report said.
   ``However, the growing over-reliance on testing over the past
several decades deprives the nation of much of the talent it needs
and sometimes conflicts with the nation's ideals of fairness and
equal opportunity,'' it said.

   The countryside offers no escape from the social
and economic pressures that lead kids to do poorly in school, a
study suggests.
   A study that surveyed school officials in 312 rural, urban and
suburban districts last year cast doubt on the popular image of
rural children leading wholesome, trouble-free lives compared with
youngsters in crowded communities.
   The study asked officials to estimate the percentage of their
students who fit into one or more of a dozen risk categories,
including involvement in crime, sexual activity, drug or alcohol
abuse, depression, child abuse, poverty or parents who are
substance abusers.
   Rural children fared worse than non-rural children in 34 out of
39 statistical comparisons, according to the survey by the National
Rural Development Institute based at Western Washington University.

   After nearly a century in which most
residents paid a few dollars a year, the only U.S. city on land
leased from an Indian reservation has agreed to a fourteenfold
increase in rent to the Seneca Indians.
   The agreement, reached Monday nine months before a 99-year lease
expires, also calls for a $60 million payment from the federal and
state governments to compensate for what both sides said were
unfairly low rents under the old pact.
   But city officials and residents Tuesday worried about how the
community would raise its annual payments to the Indians from
$57,000 to at least $800,000.
   ``If the economy of Salamanca is really impacted by this lease,
it can't survive as a city,'' said Patrick Callaghan, chief city
negotiator. ``The package we worked out is about the best package
we can get from the Senecas. whether we can get through this, I

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Put the Blame on Exxon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLEN MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARACHUTE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Exxon oil-shale debacle eight years
ago this month was the biggest and most expensive boom and bust in
the history of the West, and Exxon has to shoulder most of the
blame for it, according to a new book, ``Boomtown Blues.''
   Battered by criticism over the past year for its Alaska oil
spill, Exxon inflicted human misery at least as damaging as the oil
spill during the western Colorado oil-shale bust of May 1982, says
author Andrew Gulliford, who also wrote ``America's Country
Schools'' in 1984.
   In ``Boomtown Blues,'' Gulliford, who lived in Silt, Colo., from
1976-83, chronicles 100 years of western Colorado's oil shale booms
and the people who tried to make money from it. His book's history
of booms and busts culminates in ``Black Sunday'' _ May 2, 1982,
the day Exxon shut down its Colony oil shale project near here.
   Les Rogers, Exxon's chief spokesman at the company's Houston
headquarters, said the company will not comment on the book.
   Exxon was hardly the only player in the boom that swept the
rural Western Slope in the late 1970s and early '80s, but the
actions of the world's largest oil company both exacerbated the
boom and triggered the bust, according to Gulliford.
   After Black Sunday, 2,200 people immediately were thrown out of
work, and by the time related industries packed up, more than
10,000 people in sparsely populated western Colorado had lost their
jobs.
   So many people had to leave that local humor called the exodus
``the Parachute U-Haul Races.'' That was a misnomer, in a way,
because for two years it was literally impossible to rent a moving
van anywhere in western Colorado.
   Eight years later, the area has yet to recover fully.
   ``Though the recent oil shale boom poured millions of dollars
into the Western Slope of Colorado, on the human side of the
equation, the net result was only economic instability and personal
chaos,'' Gulliford writes.
   ``The Colony shutdown was not just an isolated incident of an
industrial project gone sour, but the largest, most expensive, and
fastest mining boom and bust in the history of the West,'' his book
says.
   ``Boomtown Blues'' reads more like sociology than history, with
plenty of interviews with the people who lived through the boom and
who have survived the bust.
   Not everyone survived. Gulliford includes the tragic story of a
Grand Junction banker who shot himself in the economic rubble Exxon
left behind.
   The residents of Garfield, Mesa, Rio Blanco and Moffat counties
are still suffering from the aftereffects of the bust. Bankruptcies
are still being filed by professionals and others who struggled to
recover from BlacK Sunday but failed.
   Gulliford attributes many of the divorces in the area to the
boom and bust. Foreclosures were common, and families were split up
when younger people had to leave Colorado to find work. Mothers
became ``weekday widows'' when their husbands were forced to
commute to jobs several hundred miles away.
   The social fabric of small-town western Colorado towns was torn,
he writes, both by the fast development of the boom that brought
developers to the area, and by the shock of the bust.
   Gulliford, who is the director of the Museum at Western New
Mexico University in Silver City, attributes the out-of-control
development mentality to Exxon's now-infamous white paper.
   Issued in 1980, Exxon predicted shale oil production of 8
million barrels per day by the year 2010, with production reaching
1 million barrels a day by 1990. To cope with the resulting growth,
it was estimated the area would need 700 new schools, 3,000
teachers and 700 new police officers and firefighters with 140
vehicles. An estimated 75,000 new housing units would be required
to handle the influx of 1.5 million people into the Colorado River
Valley between Glenwood Springs and Grand Junction.
   Those predictions threw Colorado, historically ready to jump on
any development, into a growth frenzy.
   While the oil companies _ mostly at the insistence of then-Gov.
Richard Lamm _ pumped millions of dollars into schools, sewer
plants, roads and apartments, Gulliford argues that their promises
of never-ending prosperity only contributed to the inevitable bust.
   ``The trauma of the bust was in direct proportion to Exxon's
grandiose expectations,'' Gulliford writes. ``Because people
believed in oil shale and Exxon, the bust created deep feelings of
anxiety and doubt, coupled with realistic fears of financial
failures.''
   The historian concludes that companies need to be held
accountable for agreements they make before the building starts.
   ``Corporate responsibility must be spelled out to the letter; it
cannot be assumed. Grandiose promises and projections mean nothing
in the face of declining prices,'' he wrote.
   Exxon executives have contended it is unfair to blame the oil
company alone for the economic disaster. An executive in charge of
heading Exxon's slim western Colorado operation during the latter
part of the '80s has argued that it is time to look to the future
and not dwell on the past.
   Gulliford's answer?
   ``The issues of investment, disinvestment and corporate ethics
are significant, but so, too, are the houses that sat vacant in
Rifle and Grand Junction, the 1,600 foreclosures in 1985 alone, the
high local unemployment rates, loss of self-esteem, spouse abuse,
child abuse and bust-related suicide.
   ``Far too little energy has been spent looking backward.''

   Persecution and public condemnation
didn't stop Bai Hua from writing, and now that he faces unofficial
ostracism, he's still committed to his work.
   Bai, one of China's best-known writers, has little hope that his
plays will be published or performed in the current political
atmosphere inspired by a cCommunist opposition against
``bourgeois'' art and literature. But the 60-year-old writer said
it is too late for him to cease his work.
   ``Writing is my occupation. I should write. Only time can decide
whether a work is good or bad,'' he said in an interview at the
Shanghai Writers' Association.
   The great classics of Chinese literature ``were not written
after receiving instructions,'' he told a reporter. ``They were
original ideas.''
   Bai said he will not write differently because of the current
politics.
   ``It is meaningless for me to write rubbish,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he and other artists are holding off on the
presentation of their works to avoid trouble, a year after the
military suppression of China's pro-democracy movement.
   An unofficial campaign against artists is part of a general
return to ideological orthodoxy following the student-led popular
movement, which pressed for liberalization in China.
   Communist Party chiefs have criticized the artists, saying they
have become tainted by ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or Western
ideas.
   The leaders also revived a 1942 Mao Tse-tung speech in which he
said art and literature must be a ``component part of the whole
revolutionary machine.''
   At a recent forum, representatives of the official Chinese
Writers' Association criticized advocates of ``pure literature''
for divorcing themselves from the masses and socialist
modernization.
   They called for Marxism and Mao Tse-tung thought to be given the
leading role in all works of art, and condemned symbolism and other
literary techniques as incomprehensible to ordinary Chinese.
   Bai, a People's Liberation Army playwright until 1985, is a
veteran of such campaigns.
   He was branded a ``rightist'' and persecuted during Mao's 1957
crackdown on outspoken intellectuals. Again silenced during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, he was not rehabilitated until the
late 1970s.
   Bai was singled out again in 1981 when the official press,
reportedly on orders of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, condemned his
play ``Bitter Love'' as a blasphemy against the Communist Party.
   The play depicts a patriotic painter who is persecuted during
the Cultural Revolution and, in a death scene on a snow-covered
field, utters the words, ``I love the motherland, but does the
motherland love me?''
   Bai was accused of being ``antagonistic to the party and the
people'' and forced to write a self-criticism.
   Today, he says the attacks were misguided because the
protagonist was speaking only of the Chinese nation under the
Cultural Revolution. ``I think the motherland is eternal,'' he said.
   He was also among the numerous writers censured in a 1983
campaign against ``spiritual pollution.''
   Bai spent five months in the United States in 1988 and 1989,
lecturing at 20 universities. He returned last May to join the
pro-democracy rallies in Shanghai and to sign a petition calling on
the students and the government to refrain from violence.
   Later he was called to account for his actions.
   ``I told them the truth and said I thought the petition was
correct,'' said Bai, who has not been persecuted and can travel
freely within China. He remains vice chairman of the Shanghai
Writers' Assocation.
   Most writers who supported the democracy movement have received
similar treatment, despite some instances of harsher treatment.
   Writer Wang Ruowang, 72, has been labeled a ``reactionary and
social parasite'' and is under police investigation. He was one of
three intellectuals expelled from the Communist Party after student
protests in 1986-87.
   Bai said he has had to turn down invitations to visit West
Germany, South Korea and Japan because of the current atmosphere. A
play set for performance by the Beijing People's Opera Troupe last
June is indefinitely on hold.
   His play, ``Can't Get Out of the Deep Mountains,'' is a story of
peasants in the snare of physical and spiritual isolation, but Bai
said the theme includes the reality of all Chinese.
   He expressed sympathy for editors who are forced to reject such
controversial works to protect their organizations, or who can't
act without approval from senior party leaders.
   ``Art in China is not the same as in other countries,'' he said.
In other countries writers would love to have state leaders comment
on their works. In China, they have no other choice.
   Bai said the current situation was like crossing a river where
``we are afraid of deep holes even when walking slowly.''
   We may laugh at our fears when we reach the other side, he said,
but ``most frightening would be to turn back.''
   Bai Hua is not about to turn back, but like others he is moving
with caution.
   ``Last year I could have taken you home for lunch,'' he said to
this interviewer. ``But not this year.''

   Vladimir Pozner, the Soviet journalist who for
years was an apologist for the Kremlin on American television, is
making an apology of his own.
   With his perfect English and knowledge of all things American,
from Joe DiMaggio's batting average to brands of breakfast cereal,
Pozner was the first Soviet commentator able to put the Kremlin's
spin on events without turning Americans off.
   He is proud of his efforts during the 1980s to counter what he
calls ``enemy images'' of angry, boorish, downtrodden and dangerous
Russians _ of Khrushchev banging his shoe and Brezhnev slurring his
speech, crowds queuing for food and tanks crossing Red Square.
   Although he insists he should not be considered an ``official''
Soviet spokesman, he is pleased to be known throughout America as
an embodiment of the Soviet Union.
   In short, he believes he's done a lot of good.
   So why should he feel bad?
   Because, he admits in his new autobiography, ``Parting With
Illusions,'' he said many things he didn't believe _ and didn't
have the courage to say some things he believed strongly.
   In commentaries broadcast around the world by Moscow radio and
appearances on American television shows such as ABC's
``Nightline,'' he excused the Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968, endorsed the internal exile of Andrei
Sakharov in 1980, idealized the accomplishments of the Soviet
economy and sang phony paeans to justice in a communist society.
   ``Why did I do this? Some things I did not see, and others I did
not want to see,'' he said in an interview in New York. ``... It
was very painful to come to the realization that I was trying to
defend things that really weren't defendable.''
   To many Americans, Pozner's confession that he was not
completely honest with his listeners, or with himself, will come as
little surprise. He never has lacked critics or doubters here.
   The timing of his admission _ in a period when the Kremlin is
encouraging self-criticism and historical revision _ also invites
skepticism.
   A decade ago, such a confession could have landed him in jail
and would have been courageous. But now that resentment against
orthodox communists is running high in the East bloc, his admission
of past ideological impurity appears useful, even necessary, to his
career.
   Pozner, confident and sharp-witted at age 56, knows that for
these reasons, his apology might not meet rapid acceptance in
either the Soviet Union or the United States. Yet he is undaunted.
   He has trumpeted the confession in his autobiography, published
this spring by The Atlantic Monthly Press.
   The book recounts Pozner's childhood in New York City, where he
learned to love the Brooklyn Dodgers, Pete Seeger and Mark Twain.
His mother was French, his father a Russian emigre who earned a
handsome salary in the American film industry but remained a
devoted communist and never gave up his Soviet citizenship.
   Despite a classic American boyhood _ paper route, baseball
games, summer camp _ Pozner says he never felt fully American.
Other kids at Stuyvesant High School thought of him as Russian. For
a while, he thought of himself as French.
   When his father lost his job because of his communist sympathies
in the late 1940s, the teen-age Pozner and his family headed for
the Soviet Union.
   They went first to war-ravaged Berlin, where his father grew
impatient with a Soviet diplomat who found one excuse after another
to delay the family's permission to go to Moscow.
   Only much later, Pozner says, did he and his family realize that
the diplomat had been trying to protect them from Josef Stalin, who
feared the influence of Russians with experience in the West.
   ``Had we arrived in the Soviet Union any earlier than we did,
there is little doubt that we would all have ended up in one of the
Gulag camps,'' he writes.
   As it happened, Stalin died not long after the family arrived in
Moscow in 1952, and they were spared. Vladimir studied at Moscow
University and managed to apprentice himself to Samuel Marshak,
perhaps Russia's greatest translator of English literature. Later,
he broke into journalism and became a commentator for Moscow radio.
   Today, he works for the state television network, hosting two
talk shows. At the very start of his career, Pozner says, he made a
promise to himself that he would not lie.
   ``I made that promise in all honesty, but I cannot honestly say
I kept it,'' he says in the book. ``It was not that I deliberately
misinformed my audience. Rather, I censored my statements, I
deleted passages that could be threatening to me, I rarely spoke my
mind fully.
   ``More than once I questioned what was really influencing my
decisions _ fear for myself and my family's well-being, the desire
not to furnish the `enemy' with ammunition, a false sense of
patriotism, or a real lack of courage? Probably, a bit of each.''
   The book, written in a conversational tone, mixes political
arguments with personal recollections, sometimes switching abruptly
from one to the other as it charts Pozner's two marriages, his rise
through the ranks of Soviet journalists, a bout of depression and
heavy drinking in 1977, and his success in the We stopped allowing vending
and camping because facilities and
halls with which we had been doing business with for years said,
`We love you, but we can't do business with you anymore.'''
   Said Duffy: ``It was one of the few ways left in America to grow
up. ``You'd have your adventures. In the old days it was the West.
Now there is no West.''

   Their classmate was a slain Democratic
president, but today they are mostly Republicans.
   They fought for the Western democracies, but more than a third
now think Western culture is marking time and only slightly fewer
think it is declining.
   In what Harvard officials say is the oldest college class poll
in the country, the men who graduated from Harvard College in 1940
have answered a questionnaire about their lives and the world three
times over the past 50 years.
   The latest results, compiled by classmate Donald M.D. Thurber
and mailed to the class last month, contain a few surprises.
   Although John F. Kennedy Jr. graduated with them, members of
Harvard's class of 1940 harbor an abiding mistrust of national
government, dubbed by one alumnus ``National Theater and Public
Relations.''
   Their median income is more than three-quarters of a million
dollars, but the class has its share of radicals, one of whom
professes to ``get redder as I age.''
   More than anything, reading the survey results is like taking a
ride in a time machine.
   Step into the world of the class of 1940 _ as represented by the
answers members gave _ and you hardly would know that decades had
passed since they graduated, years of wars at home and abroad, of
the Beatles, Watergate, AIDS.
   Who is their favorite musician? George Gershwin. The most
popular sports player? Joe DiMaggio. Beloved entertainer? Fred
Astaire.
   Particularly telling is the man voted the most admired figure
overall: former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
   ``An Englishman? A man whose career peaked about 50 years ago? A
man with no Harvard connections? These questions could easily be
asked by a man who is 40 years old,'' said Thurber, 72, a retired
public relations executive from Grosse Pointe, Mich.
   But, in fact, the choice does not surprise him, he said.
   Almost on the exact day the class of 1940 graduated, Thurber
pointed out, France fell to the Germans. The British left their
military equipment for the enemy at the beaches of Dunkirk as the
Allied soldiers fled for their lives. The world seemed on the brink
of vast change.
   ``It was just a very traumatic thing that the free world hung by
such a thread at that time. Many of us thought that we were
graduating into a Nazi world,'' Thurber said. ``That we did not do
so is due more to the efforts of Winston Churchill than any other
single person.''
   It is because the class spent years gripped by World War II that
they list nuclear war as their greatest fear, Thurber said.
   ``We fought a war to prevent all wars and now we're going to be
blown up and our grandchildren are going to be blown up,''
explained Augustus Soule, the class secretary.
   The results of the latest poll vary slightly from its
predecessors, which posed mostly the same questions. More think
Harvard is a worse place to go today than when they attended, and
more favor a conservative approach to society.
   A dramatic change, however, was recorded over the three polls in
class opinions about Western culture. In 1940, a third of the class
thought it was advancing and in 1965, that number jumped to 49
percent. Today, however, only 30 percent think so.
   The class, which once included more than 1,000 men, now numbers
688, 495 of whom completed the latest questionnaire in time to have
their answers tabulated.
   Medicine led the list of occupations, with 68 alumni, with
education ranking second with 62 and law third with 54. Most of the
respondents, however, said they were retired or semiretired.
   Almost 90 percent said that on the whole, their lives have been
very happy or fairly happy. ``Fairly happy. We won World War II,''
one wrote. Sixty-three percent said they were happier than their
parents, who were part of the generation hit by the Great
Depression.
   ``I can remember the Depression very, very well,'' said Soule,
72. ``A lot of our parents lost their jobs, some committed suicide
or literally had to go out and beg on the streets.''
   Skepticism about government and society runs deep in the class
of 1940.
   Asked to choose among a number of positive characteristics to
describe the country's current leadership, 59 percent marked ``none
of the above.'' Wrote one alumnus: ``Strong and dependable ... you
can depend on it to do strongly the wrong thing.''
   ``Executive department waffles on issues. Congress is completely
self-oriented. Judiciary swamped in endless frivolous litigation,''
one disillusioned graduate penciled in.
   ``Ethics and integrity _ forget it,'' another wrote.
   The class came up with a wealth of suggestions for improvements,
some earnest, some plaintive, others humorous _ at times,
inadvertently.
   ``Clean out the entire Congress and replace the incumbents with
their challengers,'' wrote one. ``Get rid of television,'' said
another. ``Eliminate polling,'' one alumnus wrote in. ``The middle
seat on an airplane,'' answered another. ``Get people to think!,''
one graduate pleaded.
   ``I have no panacea,'' answered a classmate.
   One, in all seriousness, offered a blueprint for change that was
a near parody of the so-called Harvard liberal. He advised ``not
allowing anyone to own over $1 million.''
   Soule disapproved.
   ``There's always a few kooks in every class,'' he said.

<HEAD>Even Bush Can't Keep the Busy Summit Schedule Straight</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It used to be lonelier at the top. The summit
is so heavily booked for meetings these days that even President
Bush has had trouble keeping the schedule straight.
   There are four summit meetings, one domestic, three
international, on the Bush agenda for the next six weeks. Sometimes
they blur a bit. But if this is London, it must be NATO. Houston
means it's economic. Washington has the budget summit, which will
drag for weeks.
   And the big one: Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
whose four-day summit conference begins in a week.
   In advance of the Gorbachev summit, Bush has met individually
with the leaders of western allies. Conferring with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany at the White House last week, Bush was
reminded that the Gorbachev meetings end June 3.
   ``We go off to NATO the next day, don't we?'' the president said.
   ``Nein, nein, nein,'' corrected Kohl, who also will be at the
NATO summit in London one month later, on July 5 and 6. That's to
be followed by the seven-nation allied economic summit in Houston,
opening a three-day stand on July 8.
   Theories of summit diplomacy have changed since the Cold War
days when every step, statement and gesture was supposed to be
carefully planned, lest a misreading make trouble. That may have
happened at the 1961 summit between President John F. Kennedy and
Nikita S. Khrushchev; miscalculations in Moscow the next year led
to the Cuban missile crisis.
   But the structured, scripted summit conference was yielding to
something less structured and more informal long before the Berlin
Wall came down. That also carried risks. When Ronald Reagan met
Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, for what was to have been
a warmup for an arms control summit, they wound up talking about
the elimination of all nuclear weapons, then parted at odds over
the U.S. strategic space defense program.
   That's the kind of thing that makes diplomats wary of
unstructured meetings between their bosses.
   Bush and Gorbachev held one at Malta, in the Mediterranean, last
December. Bush proposed it as an informal, feet-up session at which
they could get acquainted and make sure no messages were missed
amid the changes sweeping eastern Europe. But he took along a
detailed agenda of arms control items he wanted negotiated in
preparation for the real summit, now coming up.
   ``Summits take on a definition, an expectation of grand design
and grand agreements,'' Bush said before the Malta meeting.
   This time there are agreements ready to meet that expectation,
one to ban most chemical weapons, two treaties strengthening limits
on nuclear tests.
   The biggest deal, cutting strategic nuclear weapons, isn't
finished, although an administration official said Bush and
Gorbachev should be able to announce ``substantive agreement on
major START issues.''
   A strategic arms reduction treaty will take more negotiation;
final terms could be signed at another summit meeting in Moscow
late in the year.
   Nor has there been the pace and progress Bush sought in
negotiations for the reduction of conventional Soviet and U.S.
forces in Europe. Bush said he still hopes an agreement to cut
troops and conventional weapons can be signed before the end of the
year. That would be a 35-nation agreement, and some summit.
   Overall, Bush said Tuesday, preparatory talks on arms accords
went well, ``clearing the way for what I hope will be the highly
successful meeting with Mr. Gorbachev.''
   Successful outcomes are more elusive for the summit meetings
Bush has been calling to deal with problems at home. His education
summit with the governors, and the drug summit in Colombia produced
promises and plans for action, but real results will be a long time
coming. The current budget summit can succeed only with a clear and
workable agreement to cut the federal deficit.
   When world leaders meet at the summit, they usually part with
mutual congratulations on the success of their talks. The
perception of success equals success. And the scoring system
assures the outcome.

<HEAD>Pay Cable Movies Up the Ante</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It used to be that there were three
distinctions between made-for-cable television movies and those
produced for CBS, NBC and ABC: naked bodies, hard-core curse words
and no commercials.
   Cable movies still have bare breasts, a whole lot of profanity
and no bathroom breaks.
   But times have changed for pay cable films, and now they have
more _ namely, big stars, bigger distribution, sophisticated
scripts and critical acclaim.
   In the seven years since Home Box Office pioneered the field by
making ``The Terry Fox Story,'' movie legends including Elizabeth
Taylor, Bette Davis and Jimmy Stewart have starred in
made-for-cable films.
   Newer stars such as Ellen Barkin, Andy Garcia, Rebecca DeMornay,
Ben Kingsley and Powers Boothe also have debuted on the small,
cable screen.
   But as the industry has grown, so, too, has controversy over who
gets a piece of the increasingly lucrative pie.
   At recent hearings before the Federal Communications Commission
over whether to re-regulate the cable industry, independent
producers screamed that cable networks operate ``closed shops''
that practice ``programming apartheid.''
   Marcy Carsey, whose Carsey-Werner Co. produces such mega-hits as
``Roseanne'' and ``The Cosby Show,'' said she can't get in the door
of cable networks such as Showtime. The message, she testified
during a Los Angeles FCC hearing held in February, is loud and
clear:
   ``Do it their way, creatively and financially, or don't come at
all.''
   What Carsey and others were referring to is so-called ``vertical
integration,'' a fancy term that simply put means cable networks
and their big corporate owners can control virtually every aspect
of moviemaking, from production to distribution to overseas rights
to syndication.
   And what Carsey and other Hollywood independents want is for the
FCC to implement the Financial Interest &amp; Syndication Rules of 1970
_ which prohibit broadcast networks from owning financial interests
in their programs _ in the cable industry.
   FCC commissioners did not seem overly sympathetic.
   ``I've heard some strange arguments in my time,'' commissioner
Andrew Barrett said at the hearing. ``It sounds like you folks want
to have your cake and eat it too, and you want us to protect your
cake.''
   Cable network officials feel likewise. And, they say, the
assertions of producers such as Carsey are simply not true.
   ``We do not produce our films in-house,'' said Showtime's senior
vice president of original programs, Steve Hewitt. ``We've used
independent producers for a lot of our films.''
   And while ``back-end'' deals (Hollywood jargon for splitting up
who gets the proceeds from distribution and syndication rights) are
not as profitable in cable movies, Hewitt said Showtime wouldn't
use independent producers just to cheat them on the back end.
   HBO leads the pack in cable movies, having produced 47 of them.
It also is the only cable network to have won an Emmy, for best
screenplay in the critically acclaimed ``Murderers Among Us: The
Simon Wiesenthal Story.''
   Over the years, HBO has tackled social issues and charismatic
leaders, from ``Mandela'' in 1987, starring Danny Glover as
then-imprisoned anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, to
``Sakharov'' in 1984, starring Jason Robards as the dissident
Russian physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   ``Our goal s to get the best movie possible,'' said Robert
Cooper, senior vice president of HBO pictures. ``And we'll buy from
anyone to do that.''
   HBO just spent $7 million to make ``By Dawn's Early Light,'' a
doomsday thriller that debuted last week. It was the most money the
network had ever spent on a movie. On average, cable networks such
as Showtime, USA Network and Ted Turner's TNT spend between $3
million and $5 million.
   The revenues from such productions are generated by subscriber
fees, home video sales, domestic syndication and foreign theatrical
distribution.
   Showtime's Hewitt said his network is happy just to break even
on cable movies. HBO's Cooper said his company sometimes ends up
writing off a big chunk of what it costs to make a movie.
   Don't let them fool you, however. According to estimates by the
media research firm of Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., a well-received
cable film can bring $2 million to $4 million in foreign revenue
alone.
   And in an era of intense competition between broadcast networks,
cable networks, independent television stations, theatrical movies
and home video rentals, made-for-cable television movies are in an
enviable position.
   They attract big stars, they're made on relatively small
budgets, some have garnered rave reviews, and _ in the language
that speaks best to the cable networks' corporate owners _ they can
bring in big bucks.

   If restaurants priced services the way hospitals
do, customers would be charged for each use of the salt shaker,
each pat of butter, each glass of water.
   Still, there would be a difference: at least the customer could
read the restaurant's bill.
   That description is from a report on health care by the National
Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank with a strong
inclination toward free-market solutions to economic problems.
   John Goodman, its president, says health care is dominated by
insurers, government and employers, leaving individuals little
control over the prices they pay or the quality of care they
receive.
   His hope, he says, is ``to restore the patient as the principal
buyer of health care and unleash an army of millions of informed
shoppers into the medical marketplace.''
   While that prospect seems distant, the report suggests that a
beginning could be made by requiring any hospital that receives
Medicare money to quote preadmission prices to all patients.
   At the moment, it says, nobody understands a hospital bill, nor
do many patients or even their insurers read them thoroughly or
with understanding.
   At discharge, the report states, the patient is probably no
better informed than on entering. The reason: literally hundreds of
line items prices. Why, after just a few days ``a typical bill can
stretch 30 feet in length.''
   The potential is much longer. A single hospital, the report
states, can have as many as 12,000 different line-item prices.
Comparison shoppers in the Chicago area, it says, would have to
contend with 600,000 prices.
   It isn't so much the length of the bill that's sickening, the
report suggests, as it is the likelihood that ``about 90 percent of
the items listed on a hospital bill are in principle unreadable.''
   As a result, it continues, patients often cannot even recognize
the service rendered, and even when they can recognize the service
they cannot form a judgment about whether the charge is reasonable.
   ``For example, a $30 charge for a Tylenol capsule is common but
clearly outrageous, as is a $45 charge for an admissions kit,
similar to the free kits airlines give patients on international
flights,'' says the report.
   What is a reasonable price for an X-ray, a blood count or a
urinalysis? The center answers: They can be many times the cost at
one hospital compared with another within walking distance.
   Here are some examples of total charges for outpatient services
reported to the state by Chicago hospitals in 1988:
   Mammogram, from $13 to $127; CT scan, from $59 to $635 (however,
the center failed to specify the types of scans); tonsillectomy,
from $125 to $3,365; cataract removal, from $125 to $4,279.
   If patients knew about these differences, says Goodman, they
might be able to significantly reduce their medical bills.
   How do such variances occur? One reason, the report states, is
that line-item prices have little to do with supply and demand, as
do prices in most businesses. They are artifacts of the
reimbursement system; they aren't real, it says.
   Because they are reimbursed by insurers on the basis of costs,
hospitals have an ``incentive to artificially raise or lower prices
in order to manipulate their reimbursement from third-party
payers.''
   Reading this report, you might conclude, is enough to make a
person sick. Well, at least mildly so, but nothing like the shock
of being confronted by 600,000 hospital prices or receiving a
hospital-style bill in a restaurant.
   But sick enough, certainly, to avoid going to the hospital.

   Charles W. ``Chuck'' Colson probably has been in as many prisons
as anyone, including serving a term in one. His latest incursion _
into the lockups of the Soviet Union _ turned up an approach he
considers lacking in this country.
   They have ``better organized work programs,'' said the veteran
traveler of the behind-bars circuit and fervent advocate of bracing
up prisoners, body and soul.
   ``It's an area where we can learn something from the Russians,''
he said in an interview. ``One of the troubles with American
prisons is that we don't give inmates meaningful work. That can
drive a person crazy.''
   Colson is head of Prison Fellowship, a group based in Reston,
Va., that has grown into a worldwide organization to bolster
religious faith among prisoners and seek reforms in the system.
   Talking about the work programs in the two countries' prisons,
he said, ``The Russians are doing a better job of it.''
   That was his conclusion after a rare visit inside five Soviet
prisons with a U.S. Department of Justice delegation at the
invitation of the Soviet Bureau of Internal Affairs.
   ``All of them had work programs, including for juveniles,'' he
said. ``It was especially good in a women's prison. Everbody had a
job. There was plenty of work to do. They got two-thirds of the
going wage for their work.
   ``They were paid bonuses if they produced more. They were
charged for room and board. Morale was excellent. I told them they
were more capitalistic than on the outside. They didn't understand
that.
   ``It's one of the best industry work programs I've seen anywhere
in Europe or the United States.''
   Colson, who became a staunch Christian after serving seven
months in prison as a Watergate conspiracy offender, started his
prison organization in 1976. He has since visited prisons in 28
countries, including about 300 in the United States.
   He said most of the Soviet prisons he visited, one the remote
Perm 35 where several notable political prisoners once were held,
remained repressive, restricting mail and family visits, but all
had work programs.
   Developing such productive programs would improve American
prisons, he said. It's a reform also advocated by retired Chief
Justice Warren Burger, but opposed by labor and businesses as
unfairly competitive.
   Since human beings are ``made in the image of God, purposeful
and creative'' work gives a person ``a sense of purpose in life,''
Colson said. ``Take away that sense of purpose and you kill him.
   ``To deprive him of work is to deprive him of human dignity.
That's one of the worst things we do in American prisons.''
   Colson's Prison Fellowship conducts Bible-training seminars in
about 600 U.S. prisons, with courses given 50,000 inmates last
year, served by 33,000 volunteers.
   Also last year, 50 work-release programs were conducted in each
of which several prisoners were furloughed for community renovation
projects.
   ``The movement is spreading very rapidly,'' Colson said, noting
the group has chartered programs in 39 countries and some work in
20 others.
   He also expects it to be functioning soon in the Soviet Union at
the invitation of Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, who Colson said
told him crime was up sharply and religion needed.
   ``They welcome it,'' he said. ``The Russians thoroughly realize
they need religious values to give order to society.''
   Colson said a training program was planned for the Soviet Union
in June, with Russian Orthodox, Baptist and other denominations
invited to participate.
   Colson, 58, a Baptist, added: ``Ironically, the Russians for
pragmatic reasons want religion and we're trying to eliminate it.
It's crazy. It's one of the great ironies of history.''
   For example, he noted the U.S. Supreme Court has banned display
of the Ten Commandments at public schools, but said a committee of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences is studying how to integrate the
commandments into education.
   ``They're now treating them as the greatest moral code ever,''
Colson said. But ``Americans, wallowing in self-indulgent
materialism, are working to expurgate religion from every area of
life.''
   He attributed the unexpected overturning of communism across
Eastern Europe to an overflowing of pent-up spiritual energies,
citing its church-based origins in Poland, East Germany and Romania
and similar processes elsewhere.
   However, he contended, the U.S. government and news media had
largely ignored the religious impetus, as they did prior to similar
upheavals in Iran and the Philippines.
   U.S. embassies typically ``don't understand it,'' he said.
``They don't know what's going on. The spiritual is hard to discern
and they're just not with it. They don't look beneath the surface.
Intelligence satellites can't see into human hearts.
   ``When we take our political measurments, we count the nuclear
situation and gross national product, but mark religion as a
throwaway.''
   Partly, he said, it's a result of ``religious illiteracy'' among
journalists and other analysts.
   ``But there's also a bigotry that won't take religion very
seriously,'' he said. ``There's a denial of religion by our
cultural elite as irrelevant and simple-minded. So we don't see it
when it's there.''

   A year after the massacre that left their friends
dead and bloodied on Tiananmen Square, the fervoas
faded and many Chinese students in the United States have put away
their protest signs and reopened their br of last June hooks.
   Chinese students here still push for democratic reforms, but
many are split over what road the movement should take. And some
former activists even suggest their counterparts in China pushed
the government too far and are partly responsible for the infamous
crackdown.
   Xu Chenggang, 38, a graduate student in economics at Harvard
University, watched the televised images of the tanks rolling into
the Gates of Heavenly Peace, as the square is called in Chinese.
   He saw his friends maimed and killed. Like many others, he was
roused to action.
   ``In that time, in my mind, the most important thing was to stop
the killings, so I got very active and emotional,'' Xu said. ``For
two months, I went to ralli not be true,'' Li said. ``In certain places,
people
don't have food anymore. That information could trigger
pro-democracy movement.''
   A pro-democracy newspaper set up by Chinese journalists and
students in Los Angeles has a circulation of 30,000 and is
published every 10 days. It is distributed in China and several
Western nations.
   ``We get into China three ways _ fax, mail and smuggling,'' said
editor-in-chief Ben Tang. ``We are in at least 20 major cities
there.''
   Many students, however, continue to be frightened to speak up,
both because they want to return home someday and because they fear
reprisals against loved ones in China, Pei said.
   The students' fears were heightened recently by reports from a
Chinese bureaucrat who defected to the United States. He said the
Communist Party planned to send officials to U.S. college campuses
to court sympathetic students and intimidate the Chinese activists.
   ``They saw what happened in China. They know politics is a risky
business,'' Pei said. ``We lost quite a large number of people,
especially after the new revelations.''
   Pei said students no longer believe change will take China by
storm as it has Eastern Europe, so their concerns are less urgent
than last spring and their goals have become long-term.
   Key issues now are economic sanctions against China and whether
the country will continue to enjoy favorable trading status with
the United States, he said.
   Here, there is disagreement. Some students said they support
strong economic sanctions against China for the crackdown. Xu,
however, said sanctions would hurt fledgling entrepreneurs and
joint business ventures with the West.
   ``Joint ventures are really good things,'' Xu said. ``Removing
those things would remove the seeds of the revolution.''
   Pei said student emotions ``have cooled a little bit since last
June. Some people say tough sanctions, others say less. People
differ on how the movement should proceed.''
   The students do agree that the long march toward democracy in
China began in earnest last June 4.
   ``Before last spring, democracy as a goal was illegitimate,''
Pei said. ``Now it's been branded by blood into the national
consciousness.''
   The gains made, they also note sadly, came at a high price both
for the students who stood in the square that night and those who
stood with them from afar.
   ``I'm one of the so-called extreme counterrevolutionaries,''
said Pei, whose parents, sisters and brother are back home in
Shanghai. ``It would be suicidal to go back.''

<HEAD>It Is a New World, and the Superpowers Don't Run It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superpowers suddenly don't seem so super
anymore. Or so threatening.
   So the notion of George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev sitting down
at a superpower summit, as they will in four days, seems vaguely
out of date. They can still destroy the world, but they can't
control it.
   Even the idea of chipping away at nuclear stockpiles _ each side
has about 25,000 nuclear weapons _ lacks the urgency it had only a
few years ago. They're not about to go to war.
   The less the threat of war, the less the need for superpower
protectors and the more the rest of the world can go its own way.
   ``Summits are good things, the more the better,'' says Sam
Lambroza, professor of Soviet studies at St. Mary's College in St.
Mary's City, Md. ``Everyone benefits; no one walks away the loser.
... But it is not Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, dividing the
world.''
   Moreover, in the 1{ years since Bush took office, the Soviet
Union has lost its empire, its constituent republics are rebelling,
and its economy, the CIA says, is ``near crisis.''
   ``We don't need to rub the Soviets' face in the fact that they
are not that relevant any more in most respects,'' says Helmut
Sonnenfeldt, a veteran Soviet expert and former Henry Kissinger
sidekick. ``They are a receding power, and you can argue whether or
not we are an ascending power.''
   ``The Soviet Union is a superpower in the sense that it is a
huge land mass, although it is a restless and messed-up land
mass,'' says Sonnenfeldt, a hardliner in U.S.-Soviet relations.
``It remains a superpower because it has a formidable military
capacity, even though there's some question even about the morale
of its troops.''
   Adds Lambroza: ``We're not talking to them about Cuba or Africa
or the Middle East because in some ways the Soviet Union has
stopped being players.''
   In 1986, the world gasped when Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, in
the frosty city of Reykjavik, Iceland, came, it seemed, within a
handshake of agreeing to cut their strategic stockpiles by half.
   Now the world would nod approval if Gorbachev and Bush did that,
then go about its business.
   But the notion that the leaders of the United States and the
Soviet Union could settle the world's problems no longer resembles
reality, if it ever did, experts say.
   ``What we're talking about is power that can't be measured in
Jane's Fighting Ships anymore,'' says James H. Billington, head of
the Library of Congress and a scholar of Soviet affairs.
   Bipolar summitry doesn't fit in the multipolar world now taking
shape, Billington says. He notes the drive toward a united Western
Europe, the rise of the Japanese economic giant and, down the road,
the potential clout of China, India, Brazil and the belt of Islamic
nations.
   ``We are heading for a very interesting, polycentric world,''
Billington says.
   Former Sen. Charles McC. Mathias, a Maryland Republican and
close observer of international affairs, agrees. The superpowers,
he says, are not talking about the problems in which they could
make a real difference.
   ``Just imagine if they got on the agenda I would like to see _
population problems, the environment, drugs _ problems proven
beyond the scope of even the most powerful nation to control,''
says Mathias. ``If the Soviet Union and the United States would
join on that agenda, it would vitalize the world.''
   It has been a long time since world leaders could impose their
wills in the manner of the Congress of Vienna of 1814 and 1815,
where the crowned heads of Europe redrew the continent's boundaries
under the tutelage of Prince Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar von
Metternich of Austria, the master diplomat who dominated the
continent for a third of a century.
   The leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union have met
16 times since World War II, once a year since 1985.
   But the world is no longer sharply divided into two antagonistic
armed camps and a nonaligned Third World that sometimes managed to
turn the competition to its own advantage.
   In those days, the superpowers fought proxy wars, in Korea or
Angola or Vietnam or Afghanistan or Nicaragua.
   The proxy wars have ended; so has the superpowers' unchallenged
ability to call the shots in friendly countries. The United States
opened negotiations with the Philippines this month by saying that
if Filipinos want this country to give up its bases there it will
leave ``with our pride fully intact.''
   Festus Brotherson Jr., a former senior foreign policy official
in the South American country of Guyana and now a political
scientist at Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, says:
   ``Traditionally when a superpower speaks, the whole world
listens. But now when Gorbachev speaks, there is a perception that
he lacks the will and wherewithal to execute his policies.''
   Brotherson, a specialist in Third World politics, adds, ``The
troubling aspect at the summit for people like myself is that
whenever there is a cozy relationship between the United States and
the U.S.S.R., there is always trouble in the Third World.
   ``The Third World movement can no longer play one against the
other. ... Once there's no East-West conflict, the West ignores the
Third World's claims.''
   Another observer, Stanford University historian Gordon Craig, an
expert on Germany, refers to the United States and the Soviet Union
as ``the two former superpowers.''
   ``There has been a very perceptible weakening of their power,''
he says. ``The Russians are incapable of doing _ or even
threatening _ what they once could and the United States has not
been acting like a superpower.
   ``Their inability to control what is happening in Europe is
shown by the German unification process, which has gone on with
tumultuous speed without any brakes by any powers, let along the
superpowers.''
   Just as Czechs, Hungarians, Poles and Romanians shoved the
communists out of power, ordinary Germans on German streets brought
down the German Democratic Republic, the Berlin Wall and the idea
that two Germanys must exist separately, Craig says.
   He says ordinary people compelled Moscow and Washington to
negotiate an orderly German reunification even as it was becoming a
fait accompli.

   Simon Serfaty, executive director of the Johns Hopkins Foreign
Policy Institute, raises a cautionary note.
   ``The devaluation of superpower influence in shaping events does
not mean it has acquired zero value,'' he says. ``We remain
relevant to unification in Western Europe and the Soviets to the
process of liberalization in Eastern Europe. The negotiations over
Germany show that. What has been devalued can be revalued.''
   He says that if Gorbachev were to be overthrown, there could be
a ``renewed assertiveness of Soviet power,'' which even now
``remains far from insignificant.''
   Meantime, Serfaty asserts, the United States remains ``relevant
to what happens in the Middle East, southern Africa and Western
Europe _ if we have the will.''
   Serfaty makes another point: Raw military might has not lost its
relevance.
   Soviet influence ``totally disappeared'' in central Europe
extraordinarily fast, but only after Gorbachev made it clear to his
communist allies that ``Soviet military power was no longer
available,'' Serfaty says.
   Political scientist Bruce Jentleson of the Brookings Institution
says both superpowers have had trouble turning allies into puppets.
He says the United States was unable to call the shots in South
Vietnam or Israel and the Soviets could not make things happen in
the Arab states or Afghanistan.
   For all that, ``the fact remains that this summit is at least
the single most important meeting in the world,'' Jentleson says.
   He cites the possibility of reaching historic arms-destruction
agreements as well as the need to ``maintain the relationship'' in
the face of tensions newly arising from Gorbachev's move to squelch
the secessionist movements in the Baltics.
   And he points to Bush's decision against imposing economic
sanctions on the Soviets because of their crackdown in Lithuania as
a demonstration of the limits of American power. ``Every ally said
they wouldn't go along'' with sanctions, he says.
   ``The largely non-violent uprising in Eastern Europe and
guerrilla warfare in the Third World have undermined the importance
of military force to impose dominance,'' says political scientist
Stephen Zunes of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. ``Meanwhile
the rise of Japan and the European Community have demonstrated that
military might is not the only the way to go.
   ``So I would argue that the upcoming summit may not, in fact, be
between the leaders of two superpowers but between (the) leaders of
two countries desperately trying to justify their standing.''
   ``I just think that summits are less important than they used to
be,'' adds Zunes, a student of Third World politics. ``The issues
that need to be addressed are beyond the control of the
superpowers.''
   Even Bush feels obliged to argue that all is not settled in the
world, that American power still matters.
   ``President Gorbachev has made profound progress in his country,
reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned back,'' Bush
said in a commencement speech at Oklahoma State University in
Stillwater a few weeks ago. ``Yet neither can we turn the clock
ahead to know for sure what kind of country the Soviet Union will
be in years to come.''
   Still, the world has moved so far from armed-to-the-teeth
confrontation between communism and democracy that Manfred Woerner,
the secretary general of NATO, raises no eyebrows when he says, as
he did May 7, ``We are looking towards the Soviet Union as a
partner in security.''

   International camera crews couldn't get enough
of the Soviet chic featured at a punk Georgetown boutique when
Mikhail Gorbachev came to town in 1987.
   This time, there'll be no Cyrillic logos or Lenin T-shirts at
Commander Salamander. Weapons watchdogs will not give daily press
breakfasts and demonstrators will be relatively sparse.
   It's the second time around for Gorbachev and the capital is not
exactly reeling with the thrill _ even four days before the
president of the Soviet Union sits down with president of the
United States.
   ``First-time events are more exciting than reruns,'' said Tom
Cochran, a nuclear physicist who helped found Summit Watch to
analyze and explain the landmark arms-reduction treaty signed by
Gorbachev and President Reagan during Gorbachev's first visit.
   The group of nuclear arms experts put on $80,000 worth of
briefings and breakfasts at a hotel across Lafayette Park from the
White House. This year they're giving out their phone number.
   ``We deliberated about whether or not there would be a
foundation out there to give us money this time,'' said Stan
Norris, another founder. ``It's hard to sell it when the perception
is that the Cold War is over and there's not a specific focus''
such as the treaty signing.
   It's the second time around and the protests won't be as
passionate.
   In 1987 a crowd of 200,000, including several presidential
contenders, turned out to make a poignant plea for freer emigration
of Soviet Jews.
   This year the Baltic states want out, but a pro-independence
rally is expected to draw no more than 10,000 people. Organizers
acknowledge Gorbachev's role in the stunning events of Eastern
Europe and say they hope their confidence in him can be restored.
   It's the second time around and the glitz is gone.
   Wendy Red, co-owner of Commander Salamander, ordered piles of
merchandise keyed to a Soviet theme for the last summit. But the
funky shop recently discontinued a line of jeans and shirts that
had Cyrillic logos and came in Soviet cans.
   ``We thought it was going to be phenomenal, but it didn't sell.
Probably two years ago I would have had people banging down the
door to get it,'' Red said. ``It's not as trendy since we're all
friends now.''
   Still, a summit is a summit, and Gorbachev will not be ignored.
   Soviet and American flags will hang side by side across the
city; souvenir pins, T-shirts and key rings will appear as always;
bars will rename their drinks and at least one restaurant _ the
Hard Rock Cafe _ will feature Soviet musicians and dishes like
pirogi and potato soup.
   Gorbachev himself will be treated to a ceremonial welcome, a
state dinner and a day at Camp David. But he may create more
excitement once he leaves town.
   At Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., where the Soviet
leader has scheduled a two-hour stop, Vice President Bob Freelen
said the visit and a possible speech are ``the highlight since
Queen Elizabeth came'' seven years ago. ``We've gotten lots of
inquiries for volunteering to be on the invitation list,'' he said
dryly.
   In Minnesota, officials said their phones have not stopped
ringing since Gorbachev arranged to spend six hours in Minneapolis.
   Eight limousine companies have offered to provide his
transportation. People want to give him a wolfhound, a lamb, a
giant sheet cake decorated with the Soviet flag. They want to show
him tame black bears, a preserved log cabin, a father's World War
II memento. He's been invited to Rotary meetings, high school
graduations and town picnics; to have coffee, visit an art gallery,
stay at a cabin on the St. Croix River.
   ``The only thing that this compares to is when the Minnesota
Twins won the World Series in 1987,'' said Eileen Biernat, an aide
to Gov. Rudy Perpich. ``People were just going wild then and they
are just wild over this.''
   The hubbub has not reached that level in Washington, at least
not yet.
   Typical was the reaction of George Washington University
President Stephen Trachtenberg. His school's basketball court will
be turned into a press center for thousands of journalists.
   ``This is kind of an exclamation point, but it is representative
of a regular excitement that we are accustomed to,'' Trachtenberg
said. The university is glad to help out, but doesn't need the
visibility, he said.
   Washingtonians were not quite so blase when Gorbachev turned up
in 1987.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., was among the stalwart few who refused to
succumb to the Gorbymania engulfing the city. He had been invited
to the state dinner honoring Gorbachev but ate that night instead
with some contractors in New England. He was running for president
and, as his spokesman said, ``Mikhail doesn't vote in the New
Hampshire primary.''

   Ann Getty, wife of one of the world's richest
men, had a problem: She loved to read all day, but she also
believed in the Protestant work ethic.
   ``I come from nice Puritan stock, and I grew up believing that
you have to work all day,'' she explained.
   Lord Weidenfeld, one of Britain's most distinguished publishers,
also had a problem: He had been wanting to break into American
publishing for 20 years. But where would he get the money?
   It seemed Getty and Weidenfeld had solved their problems in 1985
when they teamed up to buy Grove Press and start Weidenfeld &amp;
Nicholson New York, a medium-size, independent publisher of quality
books.
   But five years later Grove-Weidenfeld was put up for auction,
like some paperback rights routinely are. As losses approached $15
million, Getty's financial advisers reportedly told the voracious
reader her job was prohibitively expensive.
   The story of Grove-Weidenfeld is merely one trauma in what
Random House executive Peter Osnos has described as ``a season of
anxiety in publishing.''
   The source of the anxiety is money _ big, corporate,
international money, and its transformation of what had been a
small industry run and staffed by people who cared as much about
literary quality as profit.
   Almost every famous name in publishing now has a famous business
name behind it: Simon &amp; Schuster (owed by Paramount
Communications), Harper &amp; Row (Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.),
MacMillan Co. (Robert Maxwell Publications), Little Brown
(Time-Warner Inc.), William Morrow &amp; Co. (Hearst Corp.).
   Indeed, ``Corporate Takeover of the Word'' was the title of a
recent writers conference at New York University. ``I'm struck by
the level of concern, that 120 people would spend a sunny Saturday
indoors talking about the publishing industry,'' says Alec Dubro,
president of the National Writers Union.
   ``If an author is very concerned about the handling of a book,
about its content, he or she is being driven away from the major
publishers,'' he adds. ``The majors are perceived as being far more
homogenized and commercialized than they once were.''
   The complaint, which is difficult to document, runs like this:
Corporations want books that earn quick profits, create little
controversy and accord deferential treatment to any person, product
or cause that it or its subsidiaries hold dear.
   However limited their grasp of literature, corporate managers
can usually read a balance sheet, and it is to this _ not ideology
or censorship _ that much of the season's anxiety can be traced.
   Simon &amp; Schuster posted pre-tax losses of $140 million, and the
chairman of Doubleday was forced out because of financial problems
there. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich borrowed $3 billion to fend off a
takeover bid, raising questions if the company can meet its
interest payments, let alone invest in its future.
   The predictable corporate response to such conditions: Smaller
advances for authors; layoffs for employees; and, since only two
books in 10 make money, fewer new titles for the public. According
to preliminary figures compiled by Publishers Weekly, new title
output declined by about 4 percent last year.
   So far, the most notable casualty of the money crunch has been
Pantheon Books, a Random House subsidiary long known for its
intellectually challenging books on a variety of subjects.
   In February, Andre Schiffrin resigned as Pantheon's managing
director rather than accept orders from Random House (itself a
subsidiary of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications) to
publish fewer books. At this, several authors defected, six senior
editors resigned and several hundred members of the literary
community demonstrated on the street outside Random House's offices.
   Whatever the merits of its books, Pantheon had lost $3 million
last year on sales of $20 million. The demonstrators said Random
House should absorb Pantheon's losses, but industry sources say
Random House made little or no profit in 1989. Advance's S.I.
Newhouse insisted Pantheon pay its own way, saying, ``I do not like
charity cases.''
   Publishing's crisis has its roots in the 1950s, when the heart
of the retail book market moved from a relatively few, large city
bookstores to many more smaller ones in suburban shopping centers.
   By the late '70s, bookstore chains, such as Waldenbooks and B.
Dalton Bookseller, were adding hundreds of new stores a year, and
they featured hardcover best sellers at discounted prices. Readers
who once waited for best sellers to come out in paperback could now
snap up the new Tom Clancy or Danielle Steele for only a few
dollars more than they would pay for the paperback a year later.
   The hardcover best seller became the industry's cash cow, but it
also changed the relationship between some best-selling authors and
their publishers. What had been a sort of marriage, for better or
worse, evolved into a temporary alliance based on the highest bid.
And as long as new stores kept opening, no bid seemed too high.
   Shopping mall construction and bookstore openings slowed over
the last five years, but literary agents continued to demand
ever-larger advances and guarantees.
   Jason Epstein, a top editor at Random House, cites Stephen
King's sales figures to illustrate the consequences.
   In 1985, King's ``Skeletn Crew'' sold 720,000 copies; two years
later, as chain store volume was peaking, sales of his
``Tommyknockers'' doubled to 1.4 million copies. Last year,
however, only 1.6 million copies of King's new novel, ``The Dark
Half,'' were shipped to retailers, and many of those were returned.
   With fewer stores opening, there is no way sales of ``The Dark
Half'' can exceed those of King's previous novels at anything like
the rate at which sales of ``Tommyknockers'' exceeded those of
``Skeleton Crew.'' Yet for ``The Dark Half'' and King's next three
novels, King's publisher is said to have guaranteed between $35
million and $40 million _ ``sums that presuppose a continually
expanding market,'' Epstein says.
   Even in this inflationary atmosphere, Grove-Weidenfeld was
conspicuous, as one observer put it, for ``noisily slapping money
down on the table.'' One of its editors was quoted as saying,
``They have given me a very big budget to acquire very big books.''
   Very big sales, however, proved more elusive. Shana Alexander
was paid $500,000 for a book on the Pizza Connection heroin trial,
but booksellers sold only 26,000 of a 100,000-copy printing and
sent the rest back.
   On Feb. 27, the same day Schiffrin resigned at Pantheon,
Grove-Weidenfeld was put up for sale. Potential bidders were
reported to include the usual corporate subsidiaries, including
MacMillan, Harper &amp; Row, Simon &amp; Schuster and Random House.
   But two months later Getty said the firm would not be sold
because of ``the strong feeling among authors, agents and
booksellers that we should not be swallowed by a publishing
conglomerate.''
   In fact, according to industry sources, the conglomerates
decided Grove was indigestible.
   The publishing house once described as ``famous for low sales
and high advances'' had failed to elicit a decent bid.

   The Polish publisher had struggled for 12 years
in the underground to provide books to an audience hungry for the
truth. Now all those clandestine times were behind him, and he was
touring the West to seek the help of friends in transforming his
press into a commercial venture.
   But Grzegorz Boguta's first taste of the Western publishing
trade was a bit sour. Arriving on a New York visit, he learned that
his friend, Andre Schiffren, had been forced to resign as director
of prestigious Pantheon. The publisher's corporate parent, Random
House Inc., found that Schiffren hadn't been paying enough
attention to the bottom line.
   This lesson about the duress that money can exert on artistic
endeavors was a ``good one for us to learn,'' Boguta said, somewhat
ruefully, in a recent interview. ``It showed us we have to mix
books we think are important with books that will sell.''
   Boguta's NOWA (independent publishing house) press published
more than 500 titles between 1977 and March, when he closed it.
Most were tiny editions distributed free among friends. Among the
authors he published were Nobelists Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Andrei Sakharov, Jean Paul Satre and Philip Roth.
   But one advantage to underground publishing, Boguta said, is
that as long as it remains free of the security police's clutches,
it is totally independent. As he attempts to restart NOWA as a
commercial publisher, Boguta is coming to grips with a new variety
of problems.
   No one in Poland has the money to invest in a publishing house,
and Boguta is leery about relying on the Polish state or foreign
investors. Furthermore, Poland's brusque experiment with
free-market capitalism has sent prices skyrocketing.
   ``People don't have enough money to buy food, let alone books,''
he said.
   ``Coming into a free market economy is hurting publishers even
more than it's hurting other people,'' said Roland Algrant,
director of the International Freedom to Publish Committee of the
Association of American Publishers.
   The group provided money to clandestine publishers of
manuscripts in the Soviet Union in the old days and continues to
help them. But their needs have increased dramatically, Algrant
said.
   ``When they did everything with carbon copies, $100 was a lot of
money,'' he said. ``Now a $2,000 grant is practically nothing. They
need paper, they need equipment. All of a sudden they have a market
and want to make 10,000 copies instead of 10.''
   Americans are helping. Writers such as William Styron and Kurt
Vonnegut have donated the rights to their novels to publishers in
the newly democratic countries of Central Europe. The U.S.
Information Service is providing grants for equipment.
   Schiffrin, who as Pantheon's director led a group called Friends
of NOWA, had signed an agreement that provided the Polish publisher
$25,000 for rights to the English translations of future NOWA
books. But out of solidarity with Schiffrin, Boguta hasn't
approached the publisher's new directors to ask about the status of
that loan.
   The Pantheon brouhaha is part of a wave of mergers, shakeups and
financial troubles at quality American publishers in recent years.
Amid the general nervousness, some editors questioned whether these
houses were capable of showing greater interest in Eastern European
writers.
   ``You have a whole attitude in the publishing industry these
days that you don't publish unless you can make profits,'' said
Algrant. ``The editors are all dying to get new Eastern European
writers, but the financial managers say, `Where's all this going to
lead?'''
   Said one editor who has worked with Czech writers: ``I think
it's sadly ironic that just when the Eastern European writers have
an opportunity to publish without smuggling their manuscripts out,
the climate in the United States is a little harder-nosed as far as
the bottom line goes.''
   Some believe the apparent end of Communist rule will diminish
interest in a literature whose piquancy partly resided in its
dissident character.
   Wendy Luers, who befriended many of Czechoslovakia's leading
intellectuals when she and her husband, then-Ambassador William
Luers, were in Prague in 1983-86, recalled telling a Czech
novelist: ``If you want to be judged on your merits, not as a
dissident, you have to hit the hard old business of getting your
manuscripts rejected.''
   Luers, as president of Charter 77 Foundation-New York, has been
involved in a variety of programs to support Czech culture and
bring Czech and American writers together. She is organizing a
Prague visit for top literary agents, Lynn Nesbitt and Mort Janklow.
   ``We hope that if we can get American publishers interested in
Eastern European writers we'll get the Latin American literary
phenomenon _ creating a genre that people will be interested in
reading,'' she said.
   Knopf is publishing two of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel's
books this year, as well as two books by novelist Ivan Klima. But
the lasting appeal of many important dissident writers, both in
translation and their home countries, remains to be seen. Some
suggest that many members of the underground will stay there,
although it will be a legal underground.
   ``Nobody knows yet whether the `alternative culture' that
existed can continue to exist in a free society,'' said Czech
writer Iva Pekarkova. ``There were some writers who were read
simply because they were illegal. Now they may have to face the
fact that nobody wants to read them anymore. Not all of them are
great writers.''
   Pekarkova, who has lived in New York for four years, took part
in a panel of young Czech and American writers at New York
University in March. When some of the American participants
complained about publishers' timidity, the Czech panelists nodded
sympathetically, Pekarkova said. But they didn't really understand
the problems because the translator was unable to convey what the
Americans meant by ``censorship.''
   ``I personally have had problems trying to publish my book in
English,'' said Pekarkova, who has been driving cabs for a living.
``But you can't call it censorship. If the American public does not
want to read a book and therefore a publisher doesn't want to buy
it, that's not the fault of the government.
   ``Czech writers haven't had to worry about money, but ... how
can you worry about money when you can't get published at all, for
political reasons?''
   Yet some in Eastern Europe are beginning to have to confront
such dilemmas as their economies shift to market emphasis.
   Boguta watched uneasily, for example, when Rupert Murdoch and
West Germany's Axel Springer newspaper group bought into two
independent Hungarian newspapers last year.
   ``We could sell our stock to foreigners, but what about our
independence?'' Boguta said. Instead, he is attempting to set up a
consortium of publishers in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia who
could negotiate as a group with foreign investors without fear of
losing editorial control.

<HEAD>Jerry Seinfeld Says Backup Characters Took Over His Show</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Jerry Seinfeld thought his new NBC show would
be a showcase for his stand-up comedy, but the background story and
characters of ``Seinfeld'' took it over.
   ``Our original concept was that my stand-up act would be the
main thing and the story would be filler,'' he said. ``It's turned
out to be just the opposite. We have some good actors, and the
relationships really clicked. We said, `Hey, let's do more of this!'
   ``We thought we were going in one direction, but ended up going
in another. which was totally against my will. The characters at
first were just props. Now, they're the show.''
   ``Seinfeld'' is running for four episodes behind ``Cheers'' on
Thursday nights, through June 21.
   Jason Alexander, a Tony winner for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway''
who appears in the box office hit ``Pretty Woman,'' plays
Seinfeld's best friend. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is his former
girlfriend, and Michael Richards is his next-door neighbor.
   ``I'm really intrigued by the idea of fitting in tiny pieces of
stand-up into the story,'' Seinfeld said. ``I write the stand-up to
go with the story. We tape that separately on a comedy club set. I
do a whole routine and we edit it down.''
   Seinfeld calls himself a comic without a hook or a shtick.
   ``I just do observations about life,'' he said. ``I'll take an
idea, like a sock trying to escape from a dryer. Then I'll turn it
into a whole prison escape thing. I don't use things from my
personal life. It's not that funny.''
   Seinfeld is a popular comic who makes at least 300 appearances a
year at nightclubs, concert halls, casinos, conventions, comedy
clubs and colleges. He was voted the ``Funniest Male Stand-Up
Comic'' in the 1988 American Comedy Awards show.
   He appears at the Improv in Los Angeles, Catch a Rising Star in
New York and the Sands in Atlantic City. In Las Vegas, he and Cher
split the bill at the Mirage. He also makes frequent guest
appearances on ``The Tonight Show'' and ``Late Night With David
Letterman.''
   Seinfeld said he has no plans to spend a lot of time on
television. In fact, he still sees television mainly as a means to
promote his stand-up appearances.
   ``To me, the big thing is to get people to come and see you,''
he said. ``That's an accomplishment. Watching a comedian on TV is
no big thing. I wouldn't want to go from show to show like Bob
Newhart. This is going to be it for me as a sitcom actor.
   ``I love meeting people and traveling. That's what stand-up
comics are supposed to do. I don't have a personal life, but I
don't seem to require one. I think personal lives are overrated. I
do a lot of one-nighters. But I get back to my home in New York
regularly. I have as much free time as anyone.''
   Seinfeld, who grew up in Brooklyn, said he decided at age 8 to
become a comedian.
   ``I didn't really do any comedy until I was out of college, but
I was always fascinated by it,'' he said. ``I liked Bill Cosby a
lot when I was young. He was great. He's still great. I liked Alan
King, George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Robert Klein. I was always
fooling around like kids do. I just couldn't stop doing it. It was
fun to laugh and make other people laugh.
   ``I started out on amateur nights at the comedy clubs. I was
nervous at first, then I really got into it. I knew I was going to
make it from my first moment onstage.''
   Seinfeld writes all of his own material because it gives his act
a point of view. He said most of the episodes for ``Seinfeld'' were
written with another comedian, Larry David.
   A few years ago, he appeared on ``Benson'' three times as the
governor's joke writer.
   ``The idea was that the jokes would be so bad they would be
funny,'' he said. ``But bad jokes aren't funny. They're just bad.
That was my only previous acting experience. I had no idea what I
was doing. That's how I'm most comfortable.''

<HEAD>Processed Rice Foods Find a Niche in Japanese Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan officially bans rice imports but there's
a loophole that allows shipments of processed rice products. A
major share comes from Japanese-financed companies in the United
States.
   The niche market ``has shown promising growth for U.S.
exporters,'' says James V. Parker, U.S. minister-counselor for
agricultural affairs in Tokyo.
   Manufacturers are prevented by Japan's food-control law from
importing cheaper foreign rice, so they have turned to importing
processed rice items, which are not covered by the ban.
   Japan has stubbornly resisted attempts by the United States and
other rice exporting nations to relax its import restrictions.
   Parker, writing in the June issue of AgExporter magazine, said
the United States ranks second behind Thailand as a supplier of the
processed rice products, which include rice flour preparations,
rice crackers, rice mixed with meat or seafood, and rice wine.
   Most of the processed rice products are imported by smaller
trading houses with ties to Japanese food processors and retailers.
   ``The big jump in rice product imports from the United States,
at the expense of Thailand, can be traced to Japanese investment in
the United States,'' Parker said. ``In the past year, Japanese
firms have invested in four food processing plants in California.''
   Besides ensuring that the products suit the palates of Japanese
consumers, the companies are familiar with government import red
tape and Japan's distribution systems.
   However, Parker said Japanese customs officials carefully
analyze the rice mixtures to see that they conform to standards.
And there are tariffs on the processed items.
   The niche market is relatively small, but it apparently is
attractive to Japanese investors who are using it to circumvent
Tokyo's official policy against rice imports.
   It also is attracting other suppliers. Besides Thailand and the
United States, competition is developing from Taiwan, China,
Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Indonesia and others, Parker
said.
   Although the niche market for U.S. rice products is a help, it
still skirts the broader issue of Japan's flat-out refusal to open
its import door to foreign rice.
   The rice issue came to one of its periodic heads in the last few
weeks after Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter predicted April 9
that Japan would abolish its rice import bank by the end of this
year, when the ``Uruguay Round'' of trade talks is scheduled to end.
   In a televised satellite interview with European reporters,
Yeutter said Tokyo could not stand for world trade liberalization
without looking at its own policies.
   ``And my judgment is that the political leadership of Japan will
come to that same conclusion between now and December, and,
therefore, Japan will open its rice market,'' Yeutter said.
   But Yeutter conceded there will be a great debate among Japanese
leaders as to how far the rice door will open.
   ``No one is suggesting that Japan must open its rice market
totally,'' he said. ``That's unrealistic.''
   Earlier this month, Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry
and fisheries, Tomio Yamamoto, told reporters in Tokyo that Yeutter
had been interfering in Japan's internal affairs.
   Yamamoto, asked about remarks by U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills also touching on rice policy, replied that his country ``is
not patient enough to endure further meddling by U.S. government
officials in Japan's rice policy.''
   Yeutter, after reading press reports about Yamamoto's remarks,
fired off an angry letter to the Japanese official, with copies
delivered last week to news organizations.
   Yeutter was U.S. trade representative in the Reagan
administration before taking over as secretary of agriculture for
President Bush.
   ``After working so hard over the past three years to manage this
issue in a non-confrontational way, I am personally offended and
deeply distressed to read that I am, nonetheless, accused of
interfering in Japan's internal policy,'' he wrote Yamamoto.
   Yeutter said Japan ``agreed conceptually'' to negotiate on its
agricultural import restrictions when Yamamoto's government
concurred in the formation of the Uruguay Round of talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Meanwhile, Yeutter and other American critics say Japanese
consumers are paying two to three times the world price for
domestic rice because of their government's import policy.

   If your image of the office desk is a
flat, rectangular surface with drawers on the side, then get ready
for the ``work station of the future.''
   Officials at Steelcase Inc., the world's largest office
furniture manufacturer, unveiled prototypes Tuesday of six
futuristic stations designed by art college students.
   Among the prerequisites for each design: a place for a fax
machine, videocassette recorder, personal computer and telephone.
   One model featured a mini marble conference table that folds up
like an ironing board into a shelving tower with space for a VCR,
fax machine and computer. Protruding from the sides of the tower
are large fans, used as office dividers. When everything is folded
up, it becomes a free-standing unit on wheels.
   Another model has a small work space with a computer but is
linked to a larger station with what appears to be a low, round
coffee table in the center. Images from the computer terminal are
projected onto a flat monitor on the table, which is surrounded by
three lighting columns.
   ``The worker reaction? Some would probably be attracted to them,
and then some would wonder, `how did it land?''' said Paul Cornell,
manager of behavioral and environmental research at Steelcase.
   Nineteen students at the Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena, Calif., worked for three months on the
Steelcase-sponsored project, called Smart Box, which is on display
at Steelcase's Corporate Development Center through May 24.
   Another requirement for the work station is that it allow three
people to work there at the same time to meet the trend toward
group problem-solving _ but that it be flexible enough for the
worker who wants privacy.
   ``As a result, you have components that can be moved,
reconfigured to meet the situation,'' said Terry West, industrial
design director for Steelcase.
   Some of the designs were relatively simple. One had two
trapezoidal glass tops surrounded by posts, between which a
tarpaulin is stretched to create a ``kids' clubhouse'' atmosphere,
West said.
   The designs emphasized natural materials, lighter colors and
warmer lighting to replace the ``hard plastics and flashy chrome''
of the 1970s, Cornell said.
   Through the program, Steelcase hopes to stimulate curriculum
toward office furniture design at the art school, West said.
However, he said some components of the work stations may be coming
soon to an office near you.
   ``We are `blue-skying' with this project, but there is an anchor
to real life,'' West said. ``It may not be that far into the
future.''

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will try
to forge some strategic business alliances to help revitalize his
country's slumping economy during a post-summit visit to the West
Coast June 3-4.
   The Soviet leader might squeeze in a quick ride on a cable car
or a peek at the Golden Gate Bridge, but his mind will be on
business during his trip to Stanford University and San Francisco,
his hosts say.
   ``Gorbachev is really interested in business opportunities with
West Coast business leaders,'' said Carol Piasente, director of
communications for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. The
chamber plans a luncheon for Gorbachev with leaders of 150 area
businesses and local politicians.
   ``He wants to hear from the business leaders, learn about their
ideas and concerns, and tell them what he is interested in. I
expect there will be some sort of question and answer exchange,''
Ms. Piasente said.
   Gorbachev's advance party from Moscow, which spent Monday and
Tuesday working out details of the visit with Bay area officials,
said he is most interested in meeting executives in the areas of
finance, agriculture, food processing and computers.
   Gorbachev is expected to arrive with his wife, Raisa, the night
of June 3 after a six-hour stop in Minnesota following summit talks
with President Bush in Washington.
   Tentative plans confirmed by officials Tuesday include a
breakfast meeting June 4 with former President Reagan and former
Secretary of State George P. Shultz. That will be followed by a
visit to Stanford University, where Gorbachev will make a speech
and meet scholars from the Hoover Institution and the School of
Business.
   Hoover director John Raisian said Gorbachev will not be in the
area long enough for ``substantive dialogue,'' but his visit could
set in motion a relationship between Hoover and Soviet economists.
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said Gorbachev may be less
interested in discussing economic theory than in meeting with
business school professors about programs to teach Soviets how to
start and run businesses.
   Gorbachev's visit coincides with a previously planned ``Soviet
Silicon Summit'' in Santa Clara June 4-14, which will bring
together leading Soviet and U.S. high-technology business leader to
build trade relations.
   Even if Gorbachev doesn't go to that conference, his mere
presence and his interest in economic development is charging up
excitement among Silicon Valley executives.
   But not everyone is planning a warm welcome for Gorbachev.
   The Armenian community plans demonstrations to protest military
rule and alleged human rights violations in Nagorno-Karabagh, an
autonomous province in Soviet Azerbaijan.
   Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians also are preparing protests
to demand the independence of the Baltic states.
   ``We want (Gorbachev) to see what he's doing is really wrong,
especially the (economic) blockade'' of Lithuania, said Joe Sidas,
of the new Baltic Alliance, an umbrella group for various
organizations of the nearly 5,000 Estonians, Latvians and
Lithuanians in the Bay area.
   The Soviet Jews Bay Area Council, angry about ``virulent
anti-Semitism'' in the Soviet Union, considered protests but
decided not to because it wanted to acknowledge Soviet progress on
Jewish issues, said spokesman Marshall Platt. Instead, the council
plans to collect petitions outside the Soviet consulate and ask the
consulate to submit them to him.

<HEAD>Convention Ends Early, Bargaining Priorities Set</HEAD>

   United Auto Workers leaders promised to
seek cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners in this summer's
contract talks despite turning back a local initiative to require
such inflation protection.
   The issue of COLA for retirees attracted the most attention of
any proposal at a two-day special bargaining convention that ended
Tuesday, one day ahead of schedule.
   Resolutions passed by the convention will serve as a road map
for bargaining committees when they sit down with the Big Three
automakers in the first two weeks of July.
   Asked after the convention closed if he would seek
cost-of-living protection in pensions, UAW President Owen Bieber
said, ``Oh, sure. We'll have the whole six miles out there.''
   Earlier Tuesday, delegates killed an effort that would have
required bargainers to seek COLA protection for the union's 446,000
retirees.
   In refusing to consider a resolution from a Flint, Mich., local,
delegates backed Bieber's plea to keep negotiating committees
unfettered.
   Bieber repeatedly told delegates that a resolution before the
convention that did not specifically refer to COLA protection did
not bar negotiators from seeking pension adjustments keyed to
inflation.
   ``I do not believe that there is one single person in this
convention hall, and certainly your president, who reads that
language to preclude our attempting to get COLA,'' Bieber said.
   Indexing pensions could be extremely costly for General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., the companies and the
union have said. The union estimates such a provision could cost
more than $1 billion a year for the Big Three.
   The UAW isn't required to bargain for retirees. But in the past,
the union has negotiated lump-sum payments for retirees to counter
inflation.
   Bieber cited five major goals of this year's bargaining _ better
job security, higher wages, pension improvements, better health
care and more responsive management.
   Contracts with the Big Three automakers expire at midnight Sept.
14. It's the first time in 11 years that each of the contracts
expire at the same time. Some of Bieber's political allies broke
ranks to argue for cost-of-living protection for retires.
   ``We must help these brother and sister retirees who have lost
the battle against inflation,'' said Jerry Melillo, president of
Local 1250 in Cleveland and a member of the UAW's Ford bargaining
committee.
   Among other business, delegates also approved a proposal to
merge three of the union's 15 regions into two. Some delegates
opposed the move saying it would water down their clout.
   But the union, like the automakers it bargains with, is
shrinking. During the past 15 years, UAW membership has dropped by
about a third to about 1 million members.
   The three-region merger, which would affect members in Ohio,
West Virginia and western Pennsylvania, would occur only when one
of the regional directors leaves office. There are about 113,000
members in the three regions.

<HEAD>Pinnacle West Rejects Fourth Offer from Utility Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of debt-ridden Pinnacle West Capital
Corp., citing success in early stages of a retrenchment plan, have
rejected a $1.82 billion cash takeover offer from PacifiCorp.
   Tuesday's rejection of the latest offer from the Northwest
utility was expected to heat up today's annual meeting of Pinnacle
West.
   The Arizona utility holding company suspended common stock
dividends in October and has told stockholders not to expect a
return for several years. PacifiCorp, in turn, threatened to take
its offer directly to Pinnacle West shareholders.
   Pinnacle West Chairman Richard Snell said the board also
rejected as too low a $500 million offer by the Salt River Project
utility to buy part of Arizona Public Service Co.'s service
territory in the Phoenix area.
   APS is Pinnacle West's flagship subsidiary and has been its only
profitable company for two years.
   PacifiCorp, based in Portland, Ore., last week made its fourth
offer since last fall in an attempt to acquire APS through Pinnacle
West.
   Company executives said they would not make another pitch to
Pinnacle West directors. Verl Topham, PacifiCorp's executive vice
president, said Tuesday his company was ready to take its offer to
Pinnacle West shareholders.
   ``We have yet to hear any positive statement from Pinnacle West
management concerning the future,'' Topham said in a prepared
statement.
   ``Continued rejection of a better alternative for shareholders
and customers is unacceptable,'' he added. ``We think it is
appropriate for shareholders and customers to seek responsible
action from Pinnacle West management.''
   Pinnacle West's annual meeting was expected to be raucous even
before the takeover rejection. After incurring a $676 million loss
from its former MeraBank subsidiary, Pinnacle West reported a
$551.4 million net loss in 1989.
   Snell said PacifiCorp's $21-a-share offer _ $8.25 higher than
the company's stock price at the time _ was financially inadequate
and did not ``reflect the value of this company.''
   ``More importantly, this is not the time for us to sell this
company,'' Snell said.
   He said it would take two to three years to win regulatory
approval for a takeover.
   Shareholders would not receive their money until approval was
won, Snell said, and by then ``Pinnacle West's business strategies
will have significantly increased both equity and the intrinsic
value of the company.''
   He said Pinnacle West has resolved its problems with MeraBank,
which lost more than $400 million before the federal government
took it over Jan. 31.
   The prospect of better operations at the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station also bode well for the company, he said.
Malfunctions have kept most of the $9.3 billion, three-reactor
power complex out of operation since March 1989.
   ``I am convinced, based in part on discussions with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, that we are very close to getting the plant
up and running,'' Snell said.
   He said Units 1 and 2 were expected to be in operation before
the end of June. Unit 3 has been producing power since last month
at the generating site 50 miles west of here.
   Snell said PacifiCorp would be in for a long fight if it pursued
a takeover by a shareholder proxy fight.
   PacifiCorp, which owns Pacific Power &amp; Light and Utah Power &amp;
Light, has begun an advertising campaign here to solicit support
from shareholders and APS ratepayers. The company is running
full-page advertisements in newspapers along with radio ads and
direct mail pieces.

   Restaurants will be judged in the 1990s not by
what they serve but how they serve it, experts said.
   With more two-income families, people value time more and are
unwilling to put up with second-rate service, insiders in the $200
billion-a-year industry said Tuesday at the National Restaurant
Association trade show.
   ``People expect top-notch service even in fast-food
restaurants,'' Dru Scott, a San Francisco psychologist who advises
organizations on customer satisfaction, told about 100
restaurateurs in an address.
   To survive, restaurants must use psychological tricks to keep
the customer satisfied, she said.
   ``Think more of customer delight, not just satisfaction,'' she
said.
   That means using only positive behavior in negative situations.
If a restaurant runs out of a certain item, the server should not
say, ``We don't have that,'' but instead should offer something on
the menu that is similar as an alternative, Ms. Scott advised.
   If there's a long wait, give those in line menus to keep them
interested. And if a customer complains, assure them that their
comfort is your top priority, she advised.
   Seek customer feedback to learn how to please them, and
encourage employees to serve better by developing ``games'' such as
keeping track of which server tallies the biggest checks for the
day, Ms. Scott said.
   John Iannotti, manager of Nick's Fishmarket in Chicago, said his
restaurant has discovered the recipe for keeping the customer happy.
   ``Service is definitely our main priority,'' said Iannotti, one
of thousands of restaurateurs who gathered at the five-day show.
   ``We want people to walk out of the restaurant commenting first
on the service, and second on the food,'' he said.
   ``You really can't do that much with food'' to improve on
another quality restaurant's menu, Iannotti said. Service is the
variable that can determine if a customer returns, he said.
   Service showed up as a top concern among consumers queried for
this year's Yankelovich survey, an annual study of 2,500 consumers
nationwide conducted for consumer-oriented industries by the
Connecticut-based consulting firm, said Bonnie Schwartz, director
of restaurant marketing for American Express.
   ``We're moving into a much more financially conservative decade,
with intense competition for discretionary dollars, which of course
forces services to become more attentive,'' she said.
   American Express unveiled a program it calls the ``American
Express Salute to Restaurant Service'' in which the company will
give cardmembers certificates to award to restaurant staffers who
give the best service. The staffer who gets the most certificates
will receive $10,000 in travelers' checks.
   The customer who gives out the most certificates will win a
culinary tour to France, Ms. Schwartz said in an announcement timed
to coincide with the restaurant show.
   The nationwide contest runs from June through September.

   The Bush administration says the savings and
loan industry bailout will cost $61 billion next year, almost eight
times more than an earlier estimate, documents show.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady planned to provide detailed
projections of the costs today before the Senate Banking Committee.
   Brady and fellow administration officials unveiled some of the
figures Tuesday during the third round of budget negotiations with
congressional leaders. According to papers distributed at the
closed-door session, an administration ``guesstimate'' is that the
S&amp;L rescue will cost $116 billion over the next five years.
   At that three-hour meeting in the Capitol, Democrats and
Republicans moved toward a consensus that about $500 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts would be needed to balance the budget
over the next five years. But they remained divided over precisely
how much savings would be needed.
   Participants in the talks emphasized that the administration
estimates of the S&amp;L bailout costs could change dramatically.
Variables include how the economy performs, how many additional
thrifts fail and how successful the government is in selling S&amp;L
assets it takes over.
   It's ``a real hit and miss number,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   In the 1991 budget he proposed in January, President Bush
estimated that the S&amp;L rescue would cost the government about $8
billion next year. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1.
   The thrift industry has been wracked by regional economic
downturns and fraudulent managers in recent years, forcing the
government to make good on its pledge to protect depositors'
savings. The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative
arm, has calculated that it could ultimately cost the government
$500 billion to deal with continuing S&amp;L failures.
   Last year alone, the 2,878 surviving thrifts reported $19.2
billion in total losses, the Office of Thrift Management has said.
Hundreds more of them are expected to eventually fail.
   The administration documents distributed Tuesday also showed
that the White House has increased its estimate of the size of the
deficit over the next several years.
   In January, Bush projected that an improving economy would push
the budget into balance by 1995. But the papers show that the
administration now says the budget still will be $32 billion in the
red that year.
   Nonetheless, the administration estimates are much more
optimistic than those embraced by the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office. According to CBO, the 1995 deficit will be $119
billion unless action is taken.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., emerged
from Tuesday's bargaining session to say that Democrats want a
five-year package saving at least $500 billion.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking GOP member of the budget
panel, said Republicans preferred a plan in the $450 billion to
$500 billion range.
   ``It seems to me we're beginning to see some daylight that that
might be doable,'' Domenici said.
   The two sides do not expect to begin exchanging specific offers
on how to slash the deficit for weeks. They meet again Thursday to
continue studying technical issues.
   In recent days, White House budget chief Richard Darman has
conceded that next year's deficit will be about $138 billion. Bush
said in January that the shortfall would be $100 billion. The
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law sets a 1991 budget gap target of
$64 billion.

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index advanced.
   The dollar closed at 151.35 yen, down 1.05 yen from Tuesday's
152.40-yen finish. It opened at 151.65 yen and ranged between
150.60 yen and 152.00 yen. The dollar now has fallen 1.90 yen in
the last two days.
   Dealers said market players were buying the yen against the West
German mark for technical adjustments.
   ``Trading was very rough, speculative and directionless,'' said
Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank.
   ``Dollar-selling for profit-taking also prompted the yen's
strength today,'' he added.
   But the dollar did not fall below the 150-yen level, where
Japanese life insurance companies were buying back the U.S.
currency, he said.
   Some $14.4 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
238.21 points, or 0.75 percent, closing at 32,176.51.
   The index rose quickly in early trading as the yen's gains
encouraged market players, traders said.
   Masahiro Umemori, a stock analyst with Nomura Securities Co.,
said many investors bought spot issues to take profits from price
gaps between the spot and the futures markets.
   Buying slowed in the afternoon amid uncertainties over such
developments as the currency union between East and West Germany,
he said.
   ``Market players were generally optimistic, expecting that a
slowdown in the U.S. economy would bring U.S. interest rates lower,
which also would result in lower interest rates here,'' he added.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 630
million shares, up from Tuesday's 500 million.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond inched down to 87.40 points from Tuesday's
close at 87.45. The yield rose to 7.085 percent from 7.075 the
previous day.

   Here are the widely discussed alternatives to
conventional gasoline for power motor vehicles, their benefits and
tradeoffs.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Reformulated gasoline</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline modified to contain more oxygen so it burns more
completely, thereby reducing emissions of smog-causing
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and toxic chemicals. Contains lower
concentrations of aromatics, chemicals that boost octane but also
cause toxic releases.
   Advantages: Existing distribution system, requires no
modification in vehicle, has no loss of driving range.
   Drawbacks: Slightly more expensive. Not available in all grades
of gasoline. Does not meet all toxic and smog emission control
requirements in clean air legislation.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Methanol</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An alcohol fuel from natural gas. May also be made from coal,
but environmental benefits then are significantly reduced.
   Advantages: Reduces emissions of air toxics such as benzene.
Substantially lower emissions of smog-causing hydrocarbons. High
octane rating. Easily blends with gasoline. Adaptable to current
retail distribution system.
   Disadvantages: Highly toxic and emits formaldehyde, a
carcinogen. Costs more than gasoline and provides less energy per
gallon. Highly corrosive and will require modifications in
vehicles. Difficult starting in cold weather. Burns without flame
when at 100 percent. Lower energy content and lower driving range
per tank.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Ethanol</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An alcohol fuel made from corn.
   Advantages: Reduced emissions of smog-causing hydrocarbons,
benzene and carbon dioxide. High octane rating. Available through
renewal agriculture source. Blends well with gasoline.
   Disadvantages: Limited availability. Significantly more
expensive than gasoline. Has lower energy content and lower driving
range per tank. Corrosive to engine and fuel system. Difficult
starting in cold weather.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Compressed Natural Gas</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fuel already in use among a substantial number of fleets,
including school buses and delivery trucks.
   Advantages: Abundantly available from U.S. sources with general
distribution system already in place. Lower cost than gasoline.
Substantial reduction in emissions of smog-causing hydrocarbons and
toxic chemicals.
   Disadvantages: Requires vehicle modifications. Is bulky because
it requires pressure tank, normally in trunk. Substantial reduction
in driving range. Limited number of retail refueling stations.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Propane</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Also known as liquefied petroleum gas.
   Advantages: High octane. Significant reductions in hydrocarbon,
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Cheaper than gasoline.
   Disadvantages: Requires pressurized tank and extensive
modifications to vehicles. Driving range limited. Tanks prohibited
in some tunnels. Available through limited number of fueling
stations.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Electricity</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers are pursuing development of electric cars and some
prototypes are being tested.
   Advantages: Considered the most environmentally benign
alternative to gasoline.
   Disadvantages: Technology for widespread application not
anticipated for decade or more. Initial application expected to be
limited for specific purposes such as short-range commuting.

   House and Senate negotiators must decide
whether the Americans with Disabilities Act can limit the
employment rights of AIDS sufferers and still be regarded as
landmark civil rights legislation.
   The House voted 403-20 Tuesday to pass the disabilities act. The
act guarantees the millions of disabled Americans equal access to
jobs, businesses and services, transportation and telephone service.
   Three Democrats and 17 Republicans voted against the bill.
   Except for an amendment letting employers remove workers with
``contagious diseases'' from food-handling chores, the House bill
closely resembles the Senate bill that passed last September on a
76-8 vote.
   The bill, which has White House support, has been hailed as the
most significant piece of civil rights legislation since the 1964
act that opened doors to blacks and other minorities.
   ``We have just assured that 43 million Americans who suffer from
a disability but who have great abilities, if accommodated, will be
included in our American society,'' said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer,
D-Md., lead House sponsor.
   ``This is landmark legislation which extends civil rights
protections to those with disabilities,'' said Steve Bartlett,
RTexas, who managed the Republican debate on the bill. ``It is
legislation that is 20 years overdue.''
   Both agreed that a bill would likely be ready for Bush's
signature before the July 4 break. But Bartlett and Hoyer disagreed
on whether the final version will include the food-service workers
amendment, which was sought by the restaurant industry.
   ``When the facts are known ... the Senate may not feel it is
necessary,'' said Hoyer, who attributed the amendment's passage to
misunderstanding of the protections already offered in the bill.
   ``My view is that the Chapman amendment needs to survive'' the
House-Senate negotiations, said Bartlett. ``Either the Senate can
include it or the House can revote it. ... I think everybody
understood it really well.''
   Bartlett was referring to the 199-187 vote Thursday on an
amendment by Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas. The amendment would let
employers reassign a worker with an infectious or contagious
disease so that worker wouldn't handle food.
   Both sides agreed that the amendment was intended to address
irrational public fears about AIDS.
   ``This Congress should not license discrimination of any kind,''
Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., said last week. He said the same
argument about public perception was used to justify discrimination
against blacks.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, the secretary of Health and Human Services,
said the amendment is unnecessary because AIDS is not spread
through casual contact and the bill already restricts people with
dangerous infections.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Tuesday the
administration did not take a position on the amendment and that
President Bush will sign the bill with or without it.
   Among key provisions of the bill:
   _A ban on job discrimination would be phased in over two to four
years. Companies with fewer than 15 employers would be exempt.
   _Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business
and professional offices, along with any other ``public
accommodations,'' would have to be accessible to disabled people.
   _Transportation, public and private, would have to be
accessible. Timetables for implementation vary according to system.
   _Speech- and hearing-impaired people would have access to
telephone service by means of relay services. These services would
have to be provided by phone companies within three years.
   Voting against the bill were:
   Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas; Richard Armey, R-Texas; Joe Barton,
R-Texas; Herb Bateman, R-Va.; Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Jim Cooper,
D-Tenn.; Philip Crane, R-Ill.; William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Tom
DeLay, R-Texas; Mel Hancock, R-Mo.; Wally Herger, R-Calif.; Jim

Jim Olin, D-Va.; Ron Packard, R-Calif.; Norman Shumway, R-Calif.;
Bud Shuster, R-Pa.; Charles Stenholm, D-Texas; Bob Stump, R-Ariz.
   Not voting were:
   Reps. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.; Larry Craig, R-Idaho; Ronnie
Flippo, D-Ala.; Thomas Foley, D-Wash. (by tradition the speaker
does not vote); Harold Ford, D-Tenn.; John Paul Hammerschmidt,

   The government plans to call its first national
referendum to seek public approval of an economic reform plan that
could throw tens of millions of people out of work, Soviet
officials said today.
   First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov told a news conference that
the government believes it must have a clear indication of public
support before instituting a program that will switch the country
to a market economy.
   The plan is expected to double food prices and lead to massive
closures of inefficient factories.
   No date was set for the referendum.
   ``If the public refuses to consent to the price rises, then
perhaps we will have to resort to round-table discussions,''
Maslyukov said in response to a question. There have been calls in
the Soviet Union by reformist groups for such discussions with the
government and the Communist Party to accelerate political and
economic reforms.
   The new plan sets target price increases for various sectors of
the economy, including an 82 percent rise in energy prices, an
average 43 percent rise in retail prices and a doubling in the
price of food, which is now heavily subsidized.
   Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin told the news conference the
potential number of jobs that could be lost might be in the tens of
millions, even under the slow, less-drastic response the government
is recommending.
   Maslyukov said if the Soviet Union had chosen Polish-style
``shock-therapy'' reforms that instituted the economic changes in
only two years, unemployment could rise as high as 40 million.
   ``We are unable to offer normal living conditions to such a
number if they lose their jobs. It would the lead the country to
the edge of an economic crash,'' Maslyukov said.
   The long-awaited plan was approved by Gorbachev's advisory
Presidential Council on Tuesday and was to be presented to
parliament on Thursday.
   Nikolai Petrakov, Gorbachev's top economics aide, made it clear
in a speech to a Soviet-American trade group that he is unhappy
with the proposal, which will increase retail prices on Jan. 1.
   Asked if announcing the price increases seven months before they
take effect would cause consumers to buy everything now, and cause
businesses to hold back their products until the price rise,
Petrakov agreed. He said bluntly: ``This will create a panic, an
economic panic.''
   Vladislav Malkevich, chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce,
interrupted. ``That's happening now,'' he said.
   Petrakov nodded and continued: ``We'll have to see what the
parliament has to say about the steps taken by the government.''
   ``I think we should not lose these seven months,'' he added.
   A bloc of progressive legislators with similar discontent over
the reform is planning to call for a vote of no-confidence in the
government of Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov when he presents the reform
package Thursday in a speech to be broadcast live on Soviet radio
and television.
   The progressives lost a no-confidence vote in December when
Ryzkhov proposed three more years of central planning before
installing any market reforms.
   The Soviet economy's precipitous decline since December prompted
Gorbachev and Ryzhkov to abandon that economic plan and accelerate
transformation to a market economy.
   In the first three months of 1990, wages spiraled up 13.4
percent while production declined. Official, industrial output
dropped 1.2 percent, but some estimates are as high as 5 percent.
   Petrakov said the most crucial battles had been won because the
government finally agreed on the need to convert to a market
economy.
   ``Many ideological barriers have been removed, barriers which
prevented economic reform for a long time,'' Petrakov said,
referring to the Communist Party's recent decisions to permit such
``capitalist'' notions as private ownership of factories.
   But the Presidential Council chose a slow five-year
transformation, rather than the ``shock therapy'' working in
Poland, for fear the shaky Soviet government could not withstand
public anger over sudden jumps in prices, plant closures and
unemployment.
   Workers are to receive 40-ruble raises, with smaller sums for
non-working spouses and children. Enterprises then are to
recalculate their books based on the new prices, and the government
will discover how many will need subsidies to continue operating.
   Petrakov said 220,000 state-owned enterprises, or 70 percent of
the total, will be converted to stock-based companies within the
next several months, as a first step toward the government
gradually selling the shares to individuals, companies and banks.
   According to Maslyukov, 60 percent of prices will remain
controlled. These include prices for raw materials, energy and
products made by the monopoly firms dominating the economy.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says USSR Wants to at Least Double Soybean,
Oilseed Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union wants to eliminate wheat
imports and intends to more than double purchases of soybeans while
cutting back on corn, a top Soviet agriculture official says.
   But Ivan Skiba did not give a timetable for what would be a
drastic shift in grain trade and he also said the Soviet Union
would stick to its grain purchase agreements.
   One such accord, slated to be signed at the June summit between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, would
increase minimum Soviet grain purchases from the United States by
more than 11 percent over each of the next five years.
   Skiba, who is chief of the agrarian department of the Central
Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, discussed grain imports
Tuesday in response to reporters' questions at a symposium at Iowa
State University.
   He also said ``there may be grounds'' behind reports the Soviet
Union has made late payments to suppliers but said he believed the
problem was temporary.
   ``We do pay our bills. We don't borrow from Peter to pay Paul,''
Skiba said through an interpreter.
   He said that to meet new requirements for increased protein in
animal feed, purchases of soybeans and other oilseeds on world
markets would have to rise to 8 million to 10 million metric tons a
year from the current 3 million to 4 million.
   Skiba said the shift in grain procurement policy would mean
smaller purchases of corn, the leading feed for livestock. He also
said the Soviet Union ``wants to do away with buying wheat.''
   ``Theoretically we can satisfy our domestic demand'' for wheat,
he said.
   Skiba's comments came in response to questions on recent record
Soviet grain purchases from the United States and reports of
criticism within the Communist Party that such spending is using up
limited USSR reserves of hard currency.
   Hard currency has become scarce in the Soviet Union because of
falling world prices for oil and natural gas, two commodities the
Soviets have relied on to help finance their foreign purchases.
   In the 12 months ended June 30, 1989, the USSR bought 15.5
million metric tons of wheat from all world sources and 18.6
million tons of corn, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. The U.S. share was 4.6 million tons of wheat and 16.8
million tons of corn.
   The U.S. grain purchases were a record. Skiba said some of that
could be attributed to weather problems that reduced wheat
production in the Soviet Union.
   Under a previously announced grain agreement to be signed with
the United States, annual minimum American grain shipments to the
Soviets would rise to 10 million metric tons from 9 million. A
metric ton is approximately 2,205 pounds.
   Under the agreement, the USSR will be committed to buying at
least 4 million tons each year of wheat and feed grains. In any one
year, the Soviets may substitute up to 750,000 tons of one
commodity for the other. The agreement for the first time includes
sorghum and barley as well as corn under the definition of feed
grains.
   The additional purchases under the agreement could be made up of
wheat, feed grains, soybeans or soybean meal.
   The accord also will allow the Soviets to buy up to 14 million
tons of grain annually without further discussion with Washington.
The pact it replaces had an automatic limit of 12 million tons.
   But Skiba said that as the Soviet Union moves to introduce
private farms and improve farm productivity it needs to prod
farmers by reducing imports.
   He said relying on imports has caused the Soviets to become
``couch potatoes'' when it comes to productivity.

<HEAD>Financial Planning: A Question of Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What's a fair price to pay for financial advice?
   That always-thorny question can be especially tough to answer
when you engage the services of a financial planner _ a sort of
``family doctor'' specializing in the health and well-being of your
personal finances.
   Much effort has been expended over the past decade or so to
create a set of standards against which members of this growing
occupation can be measured. Still, would-be customers of financial
planners can find themselves faced with a wide array of choices.
   One subspecies charges a flat fee, in the manner of a physician
providing a medical checkup or a given surgical procedure.
   Another may work for an hourly rate, much like a lawyer or
accountant. Still another makes its living on commissions for
products sold, the way many stockbrokers and life insurance
representatives do.
   Still others, like Bob Hewitt, a Monterey, Calif., planner and
chairman of the 17,000-member International Association for
Financial Planning, use a combination of those systems.
   Each type has its advocates, depending to a great extent on the
kind of service the customer wants.
   The public at large shows no strong preference for any given
method, according to the results of a new survey conducted for the
IAFP by the Gallup Organization.
   Among the 1,058 households taking part in the April survey, the
IAFP reports, 51 percent saw benefits to be gained from the
services of a financial adviser.
   Within that 51 percent, respondents cast a split vote among the
types of planners. For instance, they leaned toward commission and
commission-and-fee planners over the flat-fee variety by 49 percent
to 43 percent on the question of which was likely to make available
the ``best investment.''
   But flat-fee planners outpolled the commission and
commission-and-fee groups as the ones likely to provide the most
objective advice.
   That prompts the conclusion that ``the method of compensation,
as long as it's fully disclosed, is not that important to them,''
Hewitt said in an interview.
   In most cases, a planner working on commission may be the
logical first choice if you are operating on a relatively small
scale or seeking ways to pursue a single goal, such as planning for
a child's college education.
   By contrast, a flat-fee planner could be the likely candidate to
consult for someone who was seeking to resolve broad debt problems
or find a way to manage a windfall, such as an inheritance or
proceeds from a winning lottery ticket.
   Even in cases where the customer has no preference, a strong
case can be made for inquiring how much and through what
arrangement a planner gets paid.
   Among the IAFP survey respondents who saw merit in getting
professional investment advice, 95 percent either agreed or
``strongly agreed'' that all clients should get written notice in
advance of how an adviser is paid.
   The idea behind that seems sensible, first of all, simply to
help gauge whether any planner is worth his or her price. What's
more, a knowledge of the compensation setup puts you in a better
position to consider the source of the advice you are getting.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co., responding to complaints about
its ``MagiCan'' promotion, ran full-page advertisements in several
major newspapers today warning consumers not to drink the contents
of the prize-filled cans.
   The Atlanta-based soft drink maker said ``a very small number''
of the cans are defective.
   The special cans, distributed in what is billed as Coke's
largest promotion ever, contain a mechanism that is supposed to pop
out various prizes rather than Coca-Cola Classic when the tab is
opened. Coke officials say some consumers have complained that the
mechanism has detached, preventing the prize from ejecting.
   Also, chlorinated water in the can, to make the unopened can
feel like a regular container, has leaked out. The water is not
meant for drinking.
   Coca-Cola spokesman Carlton Curtis said he did not know how many
newspapers were running the ``Take A Good Look'' ad, though it was
seen in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily
News and The New York Times.
   The newspaper ad includes a toll-free number for consumers to
call Coke if they obtain a defective can.
   Randy Donaldson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said that as of
Friday the company had received only 15 complaints since the
promotion began May 7. He stressed that while the water in the
prize cans tastes bad, it is harmless.

   Selling followed the news that Britain's merchandise trade

   A revision of government support for dairy
farmers and new regulations for the seafood industry are being
included in the 1990 farm bill.
   The House Agriculture Committee completed work Tuesday on the
key portions of its dairy section of the bill that will set
government policy on agriculture for the next five years.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate Agriculture Committee approved
legislation that makes seafood inspection part of the farm bill for
the first time.
   Under the House committee's dairy plan, the government price per
hundred pounds of milk would never go below $10.10. Under current
law, dairy support prices have no minimum and could drop as low as
about $8.60 per hundred pounds.
   With the new plan, the government price support would rise by at
least 25 cents if surpluses fall below 3.5 billion pounds.
   If dairy surpluses grow in the subsequent year to between 5.01
billion and 7 billion pounds, the government could drop the price
by 25 to 50 cents, but it could never drop it below a total $10.10
per hundredweight.
   If more than 7 billion pounds of surpluses result in any one
year of the five-year farm bilan Sen. James McClure won his party's primary.
Democrats
picked a Boise businessman to oppose him.
   With all precincts reporting, Rep. Larry Craig had 66,249 votes,
or 59 percent, to 45,689 votes, or 41 percent, for Attorney General
Jim Jones in the GOP Senate primary.
   Craig, 44, campaigned on his conservative record over 10 years
in the House, underscored by his drive to pass a constitutional
amendment for a balanced federal budget.
   In the Democratic Senate race, businessman Ron Twilegar had
30,197 votes, or 64 percent, to 16,658 votes, or 36 percent, for
political newcomer David Steed.
   Andrus was governor from 1971 to 1977, then served as President
Carter's interior secretary for four years. He regained the
governorship in 1986.
   A longtime opponent of abortion, Andrus angered anti-abortion
forces when he vetoed what would have been the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law a half-hour after the
Republican-dominated Legislature adjourned on March 30.
   The legislation called for outlawing abortion except in cases of
rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18,
severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or physical health
of the woman.
   Fairchild, 37, said during the campaign that he would have
signed the legislation ``in a baby's heartbeat.''
   Abortion-rights advocates targeted lawmakers who backed the
bill. The Right to Life Committee took aim at legislators who
backed legalized abortion.
   The effort created 20 primary races on Tuesday's legislative
ballot that pitted candidates with opposing abortion stands, but
only nine involved incumbents.

   American Airlines is considering a bid to buy the
Pan Am Shuttle, which carries passengers in the densely traveled
Boston-New York-Washington corridor, sources say.
   Fort Worth-based American is conducting an internal study to
determine whether the airline should try to buy the shuttle, and if
so, how much it should offer, The Dallas Morning News reported
Wednesday.
   ``They're taking a good, hard look at it,'' an unnamed source
told the newspaper. ``They're seriously interested.''
   Since the Pan Am board of directors announced last week that it
wanted to sell the shuttle, the names of most of the major U.S.
airlines have surfaced as potential buyers.
   ``It's not surprising that American would be looking at it,''
said analyst Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``All the
major airlines have to. It really offers a unique opportunity.''
   Pan Am has hired Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. to handle sale of the
shuttle. Confidential financial information was being sent out this
week to potential bidders, and business so far has been brisk.
   ``There has been significant serious interest in the project,''
Kidder senior vice president S. Lane Genatowski said Tuesday.
   Although he would not identify the interested parties,
Genatowski said they include private individuals and publicly held
corporations, including airlines.
   American officials would only say the company always considers
buying airline assets that come on the market.

   Forecasts for more wet weather lent modest
strength to wheat futures and to new-crop corn and soybean futures
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Rain was expected to return to the Midwest today after a two-day
dryout, posing a threat of further planting delays for the corn and
soybean crops.
   Isolated thunderstorms also were forecast for the winter wheat
regions of the Central and Southern Plains, where flooding in some
areas already has lowered yield expectations.
   Analysts said buying sentiment in the wheat market was tempered
by perceptions the United States will produce a large crop of soft
red winter wheat despite excess moisture, and by predictions for
beneficial spotty showers in the Northern Plains, where spring
wheat is grown.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 5 cents higher

<HEAD>Nation's Third Largest Cookie Company Sold to Taiwan Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's third largest cookie company
has been sold to a huge Taiwanese company for $335 million, the
chief executive officer of Wyndham Food Inc. announced.
   Ian Wilson, a San Francisco financier and Wyndham CEO, said
Tuesday that about half the price will be paid in cash and the
remainder represents assumption of debt, including $10 million in
junk bonds.
   The deal with President Enterprises Corp., Taiwan's largest
integrated food company, should close in June following the
approval of Wyndham shareholders and federal regulators, Wilson
said.
   Wyndham, founded in 1985, includes eight regional cookie
companies in the South and Southeast including the nation's largest
baker of Girl Scout Cookies. It sells mostly low-priced cookies
under the brand names Murray, Jack's, Jackson's, Greg's, Barbara
Dee and Plantation.
   Wyndham paid just over $200 million for the cookie companies,
whose revenues topped $300 million last year. Wilson and his
investors _ wealthy families and a few institutional investors _
have about $35 million worth of equity in the company.
   Founded in 1967, President Enterprises is a publicly held
company with more than $1 billion in revenues, producing instant
noodles, edible oils, dairy products and fruit juices. It is also
the exclusive distributor in Taiwan of Welch's juices and Budweiser
beer, and is the Taiwan franchise of Pepsi, 7-Eleven stores and
Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   President wants to expand in the United States, and selected
Wyndham as its first U.S. acquisition because ``they can get a good
look at this country without competing head-to-head with a major
food company like Keebler or Nabisco,'' Wilson explained.
   Wilson, chairman and chief executive of Wyndham, will stay with
the company as a consultant for one year under the deal. But at the
same time he'll be working with another food-products company he
has assembled _ Windmill Corp., which is even larger than Wyndham
after several acquisitions.
   Windmill, a holding company for specialty consumer goods, has
about $350 million in revenues. Since March 1988, Windmill has
spent $225 million buying Roush Bakery Products, Country Hearth,
Martha White Foods, Frozen Specialties, Flour Pot cookies, and Pet
Specialties.

   The House began considering a string of
amendments to sweeping clean air legislation today including
proposals requiring cleaner gasoline in smog-clogged cities and
assistance to workers who lose jobs to tougher pollution controls.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., said he expected a final vote
on the bill possibly as early as late Wednesday, but more likely by
Thursday. Floor fights were anticipated on several issues including
one calling for a $250 million, five-year job-loss assistance plan.
   The Bush administration has opposed the jobs assistance proposal
as well as a proposal to require automakers to build 1 million cars
that run on fuels other than gasoline. The automakers have waged an
intense lobbying campaign against the car production proposal.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told Republican members
shortly before floor debate began that the White House had ``strong
opposition'' to both the car production and unemployment assistance
program and that both could threaten the legislation.
   The jobs amendment, sponsored by Rep. Robert Wise, D-W.Va.,
would apply to all workers. An attempt to require a much broader
and more expensive unemployment assistance provision in the Senate
failed by a close vote in April.
   Sununu stopped short of suggesting that President Bush might
veto legislation containing either provision but said the White
House wanted a bill without ``unnecessary amendments,'' said Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who was at the meeting.
   House negotiators have reached a compromise agreement on
amendments that would require cleaner fuels to be sold in the most
smog-polluted cities and also on requiring tougher controls on air
pollution from offshore oil platforms. Both provisions are expected
to be approved on the floor.
   Automobiles cause nearly half of the smog-producing pollutants
that plague the nation's major cities. They also are the source of
dangerous toxic emissions including a number of cancer-causing
pollutants.
   Tougher air pollution controls included in the clean air
legislation now before the House, and approved by the Senate
earlier this year, call for sharp reductions in emissions from cars
and trucks. Automakers will have to install new emission controls
to meet the new standards, and oil companies will have to produce
cleaner fuels.
   But some congressmen say neither bill goes far enough, at least
in the nine cities where the smog problem is the worst and where
motorists buy 22 percent of the nation's gasoline.
   Among the amendments cleared for consideration by House
rulemakers late Tuesday were proposals requiring:
   _Production of 1 million cars a year by 1997 that burn fuels
other than gasoline. The cars would be sold in nine cities with the
worst pollution.
   Auto industry lobbyists, who oppose the proposal, argue the
amendment calls for such stiff emission cuts that the cars could be
run on only pure methanol or compressed natural gas. Supporters
argue truly alternative fuel vehicles are needed to rid urban areas
of smog.
   _The sale of cleaner gasoline blends that have specific oxygen
content in nine cities with the worst smog and 44 other cities that
fail to meet carbon monoxide standards.
   The requirements likely will be met only by selling a
gasoline-ethanol blend of fuel. Despite a $1 million advertising
and lobbying campaign against the measure by the oil industry in
recent weeks, the measure is expected to be approved by the House.
A similar proposal is in the Senate bill.
   Among the other amendments that were cleared for floor
consideration were proposals that would:
   Extend the warranty requirements on pollution control equipment
on cars; direct a phaseout of ozone-damaging chemicals such as
chlorofluorocarbons; and require visibility controls for many
national parks and wilderness areas.
   In addition to controls on auto emissions, the clean air bill
requires industry to curtail smog-causing emissions; calls on
electric utilities to cut 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide
emissions that cause acid rain; and will require tough new controls
on toxic industrial releases.

<HEAD>Remington Shaver Owner Has Tougher Break Turning Football Team
Around</HEAD>

   Victor Kiam once got so excited
watching a football play he knocked himself unconscious and speared
his hand on a tennis trophy. He probably won't be doing that again.
   The New England Patriots' owner and successful entrepreneur,
known for trying to buy businesses he likes, says he's still
enthusiastic about his favorite spectator sport and the team he
acquired two years ago. But after last year's dismal season, he's
containing his expectations.
   ``I'm not counting one single chicken until it's in the
broiler,'' said Kiam, 63, whose hapless Patriots were 5-11 and
missed the playoffs for the third straight time last year, his
first full year as owner.
   ``I'm just as enthusiastic about winning, but I think I have
tempered my anticipation,'' Kiam said in an interview. ``I'm
saying, `OK, it looks good, let's see what happens now.'''
   Kiam is perhaps best known as that gravelly voiced guy in the
bathrobe who's appeared on television screens pitching the shaver
made by his Remington Products Inc. As he reminds TV viewers and
others who meet him, he loved the shaver so much he bought the
company.
   Well, he likes football so much he bought the Patriots in 1988
from team founder Billy Sullivan, which Kiam at the time called
``the ultimate football fanatic's dream.''
   His purchase was especially notable because other big-time
takeover entrepreneurs like Marvin Davis and Donald Trump had
unsuccessfully attempted to buy the Patriots earlier.
   Kiam was skinny growing up and concentrated on tennis, which
eventually earned him a national ranking. He couldn't play football
himself, but came to love its strategy and unpredictability. He
admits he knocked himself cold once in his living room when running
along with a play on Monday Night Football.
   Unfortunately for Kiam and Patriots fans, the team isn't nearly
as successful as its owner. The Patriots finished fourth in their
division and hurt for a quarterback. Important teammates suffered
untimely injuries.
   ``Last year we had three of our key players out for the last
exhibition game. You go home exceedingly depressed _ absolutely
destroyed _ and say, `How do we recover?' That was so damaging.
It's a tough one to come back from,'' he said.
   Kiam acknowledged owning a football team is different than
owning Remington or The Friendship Collection, his wife Ellen's
jewelry company. There's a lot more media attention and more focus
on short-term results, similar to the pressure faced by companies
answerable to stockholders. Kiam hated that when he was president
and chairman of Benrus Watch Corp.
   ``I didn't like the fact that we were constantly saying, `If we
do this now, what's it going to do to our earnings in this
quarter?' You can't have two masters. You can only have one master,
and that's the business,'' said Kiam, who left that company 12
years ago to buy Remington from Sperry-Rand.
   Nor does he relish the fact that the bounce of a ball can change
the outcome of a football game.
   ``In business you can catch these miscues. It takes a real
letdown in the organization, or a screwup, when your product gets
affected. But the nature of athletics is they don't have the
systems built into the structure and at any moment something can go
wrong, and that is something you cannot control,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, Kiam said he's mesmerized by the same
uncertainties. He even likes the shape of the ball because it's
prone to unusual bounces.
   ``The reason I got into this is to be part of a football
adventure,'' Kiam said. ``I don't think I'll ever give up the
ghost, now that I'm into it.''
   The Patriots will improve, if Kiam gets his way. After suffering
large losses last year the franchise has already strengthened
financially, partly because of a $9 million increase in the
Patriots' share of the NFL's network TV contract. Kiam said the
business could come close to breaking even.
   He also expressed confidence that he could make the team more
successful on the field, with the same kind of perseverance he used
to revitalize Remington, which at the time he bought it was a
comatose business that Sperry-Rand was eager to unload.
   In what became one of the first successful debt-financed
takeovers, now commonly called leveraged buyouts, Kiam borrowed the
money to buy Remington, repaying the debt partly by trimming his
acquisition's fat.
   He started by cutting 79 executive positions, eliminating perks
like country club memberships, and consolidating operations at the
company's headquarters in Bridgeport, Conn.
   He also cut the price of the shaver, streamlined its packaging
and improved quality control, eventually increasing sales from $43
million in 1979 to an anticipated $350 million this year.
   ``I look at the Patriots like a business _ how are we going to
do five, 10 years down the pike?'' Kiam said. ``When you get
married, you don't say, `Well, I'm going to have a nice honeymoon,'
and then move on to happy hunting grounds.''
   Kiam's satisfaction at turning Remington around is so big he's
written two books about his business triumphs and lessons learned
along the way: ``Going for It,'' and ``Live to Win.''
   He spent his first five years working on its shaver, but has
since branched into a wide range of household goods, from an
instrument that sucks up bugs to a device that keeps nose hairs out
of sight.
   ``This thing, I think, is going to be a zinger,'' he said at his
desk, holding up the latest gizmo, a hand-held tanning wand, which
he demonstrated on his arm. ``This is a revolutionary new product.
It certainly fills a need.''
   He's also keeping busy selling belts, men's ties, travel
accessories, precision instruments and a monthly magazine for day
care centers.
   ``Live to Win,'' published last year, describes his fateful,
self-inflicted knockout while watching the Monday night game.
   ``As soon as I recovered my wits all I wanted to know _ gore and
all _ was, `Did they win?' ... We zealots are a breed of diehards.''

   Japan's land prices are so inflated that many
experts fear a sudden drop could devastate domestic financial
markets and send shock waves throughout the global economy.
   Nonetheless, few believe such a calamity is likely. Although
pressure for land reform in Japan has grown dramatically over the
past year, any changes are expected to be slow and cautious.
   Japan has only 4 percent of the United States' land area but its
real estate assets are worth four times the value of U.S. real
estate _ $14.9 trillion, Economic Planning Agency figures show.
   A doubling in nationwide land values since 1984 has put home
ownership out of reach for most Japanese and driven up business
costs in city centers. This has led to calls for reform of what
critics call a byzantine system of taxes and regulation that would
make more land available and stop the spiral.
   High land prices also have become a trade issue. U.S. officials
complain that high rents make doing business here prohibitively
expensive for foreign companies, subverting Japan's claim that it
is leveling the playing field for competitors from abroad.
   But analysts say the cost of significantly cutting land prices
would far outweigh the benefits. Promises made by Tokyo during
trade talks to increase the land supply through tax and other
reforms, theoretically reducing land prices, are likely to happen
over a long period of time, they say.
   The overheated real estate market has underpinned phenomenal
growth in Japan's stock markets and overseas investment. The sense
of wealth evoked by ballooning property values has fueled
unprecedented consumer spending, contributing to four years of
uninterrupted economic expansion.
   A Bank of Japan report issued May 9 said the government should
find ways to cool overheated land prices gradually but avoid sudden
measures that could hurt the economy.
   ``Experiences abroad suggest that it is important to forestall
any turbulence which might arise from a sudden change in land
prices, in order to maintain a safe and sound financial system,''
the central bank said.
   Economists here agree that a sudden drop in prices would have a
disastrous impact on the stock market, on banks and other lenders.
   The integration of Japan's economy with the rest of the world
ensures that such a shock also would hit foreign financial markets.
   ``The financial markets here are founded on trust in rising land
prices,'' said Susumu Kato, head of economic research at Goldman
Sachs (Japan). ``Lots of borrowing for stock trading at home and
overseas is based on land collateral.''
   A fall in land values would generate bad debts throughout the
system and cripple major banks and securities houses, Kato said.
   Major financial institutions would face a cash crunch as the
value of collateral evaporated. Many would pull out of foreign
markets.
   That possibility could do particular damage in the United
States, where Japanese investment has become an increasingly
influential force, especially in the market for U.S. Treasury bonds
used to finance the large federal deficit.
   A drop in Japanese demand for U.S. Treasury bonds could force
the United States to raise interest rates dramatically to attract
other buyers of its debt. Some economists say that would set off a
chain reaction of events that could lead to a recession.
   Most overseas investment is based on borrowing against real
estate at home. ``They don't have that kind of cash just lying
around,'' said Ronald B. Talmage, assistant director in Tokyo of
the British investment bank N.M. Rothschild and Sons.
   The risk of exposure if real estate prices here fall has
worsened recently. Commercial finance and leasing firms, for
example, have ignored Finance Ministry warnings and increased their
lending based on real estate, said David Pike, manager of research
at UBS Phillips and Drew International.
   After real estate-related loans grew 14.1 percent last year to
an aggregate total of $310 billion, the ministry told banks not to
let such lending grow faster than overall lending.
   Barring more drastic government action, there is little
likelihood of a downward spiral in land prices because demand for
land remains strong, Pike said.
   Land prices climbed only 2 percent in Tokyo last year, down from
23.8 percent in 1987 and 65.3 percent in 1988. But nationwide,
prices jumped 17 percent last year as inflation spread to Tokyo's
distant suburbs and other major cities.
   ``There's demand for residential construction and a shift in
preference toward larger homes,'' Pike said. ``Growth in economic
activity, new roads and railways, all these use land.''
   Demand continues to rise on these islands crowded with 123
million people, but supply remains limited. The Construction
Ministry estimates that tax laws and zoning regulations are
preventing the conversion of 148,200 acres of farmland and
underutilized sites in the Tokyo metropolitan area alone to
commercial and residential use.
   Government plans to revise tax laws to encourage development of
such land are unlikely to bring about a sudden change, the analysts
say.
   ``If they puncture the land price balloon, it would shock the
market, but they're not going to do that,'' Pike said.
   The Bank of Japan report called for reforms to curb property
speculation and encourage more efficient land use. Financial
institutions should also be monitored, it said.
   ``In our view, the report showed that the Bank of Japan was
serious about the land price problem,'' said Kermit L. Schoenholtz,
senior economist at Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd.
   He said the report, which attributed some of the land price
inflation to easy credit, indicated that the central bank would
keep interest rates high to help curb excessive lending to land
speculators.
   The bank's discount rate, the loan fee to banks that strongly
affects other interest rates, remained at 2.5 percent for nine
years until last May. Since then, the bank has raised it four times
to curb inflation and help support its weakening currency. It is
now 5.25 percent.
   ``It's easy to make doomsday statements, but I don't think the
problem should be exaggerated. The gap (between land prices and
other prices) has been growing for 20 years. I don't see any of
that changing overnight,'' Schoenholtz said.

<BYLINE>Pepsi Cola Returns to India After 28 Years
^By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola went on sale in India for the
first time in 28 years Wednesday following a bitter five-year
battle to sell the U.S. soft drink in the tightly controlled Indian
market.
   Pepsi, Seven-Up and Mirinda, an orange soda, hit the market in
Jaipur, capital of the western state of Rajasthan, said Christopher
Sinclair, president of Pepsi-Cola International.
   In the coming weeks, the drinks will be sold throughout the
country, he said.
   As part of an agreement with the Indian government to
``Indianize'' the soft drinks, they will carry the prefix Lehar,
meaning ``wave'' in Hindi.
   To sweeten the pot, Sinclair also promised the company would
invest $1 billion over 10 years in bottlers, distributors and other
small businesses in India.
   He also released a copy of a letter written to U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills in which he urged the U.S. government
not to take action against India for alleged unfair trading
practices.
   The compromises are expected to pay off, say analysts, who
believe Pepsi is poised to dominate the market.
   India's $350 million-a-year soft-drink industry is controlled by
three domestic soda kings, but industry analysts say there is room
for growth. Indians consume an average of only three bottles of
soft drinks a year, compared to 13 in neighboring Pakistan, 38 in
Thailand and 550 in the United States.
   Indians view Western products as superior to their own. And
their domestic soft-drink market currently faces turmoil because
the government recently banned an additive, brominated vegetable
oil, used by all three producers.
   Pepsi's position is also enhanced by the absence of its
principal foe, Coca-Cola. In March, the Indian government turned
down a Coke proposal to build a $3 million plant.
   ``The agreement,'' Sinclair said, ``shows that India can be a
vital part in the system of world commerce and that it can
accomplish it on its own terms and not on terms dictated by the
West.''
   But many view the Pepsi announcement as the last good news for
foreign investment here, at least in the near term.
   With the fall of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in November, India
appears to have ended its brief economic liberalization and is
again closing its markets to foreigners. Prime Minister V.P. Singh
recently said India is interested only in foreign investment in
high technology.
   Last year, foreign investment totaled only $200 million and this
year isn't expected to be much better.
   Pepsi's experiences here testify to the difficulties of
investing in India, analysts say.
   Pepsi has been accused of paying bribes, unfair business
practices and even possible links to terrorists. Its investment
proposal faced more than 20 parliamentary debates and 15 committee
reviews.
   In a last-minute move, the government forced Pepsi to change the
name of the soft drink from Pepsi Era to Lehar Pepsi because Era
wasn't considered sufficiently ``Indian.'' The action cost Pepsi
$150,000 in bottle fees.
   Indian newspapers hypothesized without proof that Pepsi might
want to destabilize the Indian government because its operations
are based in Punjab state, the site of a bloody separatist movement
led by members of the Sikh religion.
   ``Our project here has been an unprecedented experience on all
fronts,'' said Ken Ross, spokesman for Pepsi-Cola International.
``It's been very tough sledding all the way.''
   The Pepsi project began in India in 1985 when Pepsi-Cola
International submitted a proposal to the Indian government, which
immediately rejected it. Pepsi then joined with a state-run
company, Agro-Industries Corp., and the privately owned Tata Group.
In February 1990, the first products _ potato chips under the
Hostess brand name and cheese-flavored Cheetos snacks _ hit the
market.
   The project, based in the northern state of Punjab, includes
agricultural research, crop diversification, processed fruits and
vegetables along with soft-drink concentrate and snack foods.
   Pepsi's share in the $15 million project is 39.9 percent due to
an Indian law which restricts the holding of foreign partners in a
joint venture to 40 percent.
   According to the government's terms, soft-drink production will
be restricted to 25 percent of the project's turnover and exports
of food items will have to be five times the value of imports.
   Indians were cut off from U.S. soft drinks in 1977 when
Coca-Cola was forced to leave because it would not agree to the 40
percent ownership rule. Pepsi left India in 1962 because of slow
sales.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices plunged Wednesday in hectic European
trading following a confusing morning fixing session and amid
reports of heavy selling by Mideast investors.
   The dollar, meanwhile, ended slightly lower against other major
currencies.
   Gold lost $11 in London to settle at $375 a troy ounce, and
$11.35 in Zurich to close at $364 an ounce. Earlier, in Hong, gold
had risen $3.66 to $377.24 an ounce.
   By midday on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold was trading
at around $364 an ounce.
   Gold began to tumble after the five leading London dealers had
trouble matching demand and supply during a record 2{-hour morning
London fixing session, traders said. The fixing was finally set at
$363.25 a troy ounce.
   The fixing is an average price calculated twice a day by the
five dealers from what they hear on the market and it is a
guideline for other traders and investors.
   ``Nobody had a chance to get out of positions,'' during the
fixing, said a Zurich dealer. ``And no business was possible.''
   ``This decline wasn't predictable,'' another Zurich dealer said.
   Dealers said news of big Middle East sell orders, plus
follow-through selling, escalated gold's sharp decline. The
downturn also was attributed to a market perception that gold,
having approached $378 an ounce, had to fall back, they said.
   ``The upside began to look vulnerable to some people,'' said a
Zurich trader.
   The dollar's slight drop against other major currencies in
Europe was attributed largely to speculation that West Germany
might raise its interest rates. That would push up the value of the
mark at the dollar's expense.
   A member of the Bundesbank's central council, Wilhelm Noelling,
said in a newspaper interview that he couldn't exclude another rate
hike. He said price and tax increases were likely as a result of
the planned reunification of the two German states.
   Foreign exchange dealers said activity was moderate but
diminishing with the approach of Thursday's Ascension Day holiday
in continental Europe. Many traders planned to take Friday off as
well to get an extra-long weekend, and Monday is a public holiday
in Britain.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6975 from $1.6915 late
Tuesday. It traded at around $1.69275 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.6682 West German marks, down from 1.6685; 1.4065 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4175; 5.6125 French francs, down from 5.6175; 1.8740
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8760; 1,223.00 Italian lire, down from
1,225.25; and 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1907.
   Selected dollar rates in New York at midday: 1.6745 West German
marks, 1.41725 Swiss francs, 1,229.75 Italian lire, and 1.18525
Canadian dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.05 yen to a closing 151.35 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 150.90 yen, and by midday in New
York at 151.265.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.24 a
troy ounce from $5.19 bid Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The nation's major airlines, seeking bigger
market shares during the summer travel season, are battling one
another with fare discounts on domestic flights.
   American Airlines joined the fight today, saying it would match
cuts announced Tuesday by Trans World Airlines. USAir said it would
match the discounts on a case-by-case basis.
   United Airlines opened the fray on Monday by running newspaper
advertisements that contained coupons for $35 off round-trip
tickets of $175 or more. The coupons are good on flights through
Dec. 14 but excluding Nov. 16-30.
   The offer requires a Saturday night stayover and tickets must be
bought seven days in advance of departure and no later than Aug. 31.
   TWA responded to United's move by cutting its domestic
round-trip fares by as much as 30 percent for travel Tuesday
through Thursday. TWA also is requiring a Saturday stopover and a
seven-day advance purchase, and tickets must be purchased by June
7. The discount is in effect for flights through Dec. 13.
   For example, the lowest coast-to-coast fares would fall to $298
from $428.50.
   USAir said today it would honor the United coupons and would
selectively match the TWA discounts. Spokesman David Shipley said
USAir fares were already lower in some markets and would not be
discounted in those areas.
   Northwest Airlines said it would also honor the United coupons,
and was studying TWA's discount program and decide later whether to
match it.
   Spokesmen for Continental Airlines, Eastern Airlines and Delta
Air Lines said today their carriers were also studying the fare
changes and had not yet decided what action, if any, they would
take.
   The fare war comes during the airlines' big vacation season, and
the discounts, in particular the TWA program, are aimed at
vacationers.
   Passengers are likely to gleefully greet the lower fares, but
the battle for bigger shares of the domestic travel market could
take a toll on airline company profits.

<HEAD>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Puts Donnelly Marketing Up For Sale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Wednesday it
plans to sell most of the Donnelly Marketing division, which
provides an array of services to help marketers of packaged goods
and consumer services reach customers.
   The assets for sale include Carol Wright Sales, which markets
merchandise to consumers by direct mail and distributes cents-off
coupons through a cooperative mailing program.
   Its Donnelly Direct program, also included in the sale, is a
major provider of consumer mailing lists.
   The huge business information marketer said the proposed sale is
part of a previously disclosed strategy of focusing on key markets
for its information services.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said the assets for sale generated revenue of
about $225 million in 1989 and were profitable. It said the absence
of operating income resulting from the sale will be offset by
investing and redeploying the cash proceeds.
   The company, which earned $586.4 million, or $3.14 a share, on
revenue of $4.32 billion last year, has said it expects earnings to
fall to the $2.80 a share range this year.
   The expected decline stems partly from lower sales and higher
costs within its U.S. credit services business, stung last year by
complaints from some customers who said they had been overcharged.
The company said it has taken corrective action in recent months.
   J. Kendrick Noble Jr., who follows the company for PaineWebber,
said he estimates the assets for sale could bring a price exceeding
$200 million.
   The company said the assets for sale exclude Donnelly Marketing
Information Services, the unit that provides products to help
customers define and execute their marketing strategies.
   In addition, the company said it expects to make leaseback
arrangements with the new owner that will give it continued access
to the Donnelly Marketing consumer database, which has information
on about 84 million U.S. households.
   Charles W. Moritz, chairman and chief executive of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, said in announcing the sale plans that ``the long-term
interest of D&amp;B's shareowners are best served by focusing our
investments and resources on the information-intensive businesses
of our consumer-marketing information group.''
   That group includes Nielsen Media Research, which compiles
television audience ratings, and Nielsen Marketing Research, which
helps companies track the movement of products through the stores
and gauge the effectiveness of their advertising and promotion
programs.
   Earlier this year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet announced it would sell five
other operations, Datastream International, Interactive Data,
Neodata Services, Zytron and Petroleum Information, which had
combined revenue of about $355 million last year.
   Datastream International is a London-based provider of
investment information and portfolio accounting services to clients
in Europe and Asia, while Interactive Data in Lexington, Mass.,
provides similar services to the U.S. investment community.
   Neodata of Boulder, Colo., handles subscriptions for more than
270 publications; Petroleum Information of Littleton, Colo.,
supplies drilling and production information to the oil and gas
industries and Zytron of Menlo Park, Calif., puts information on
microfilm for big computer users.
   No announcements have been made on the status of those sales.

<TEXT>
   France's state-owned Elf Aquitaine signed an oil
exploration and production accord Wednesday with the Soviet Union,
which the company's president called the first such Kremlin deal
involving a Western oil concern.
   The ageement signed in Moscow gives Elf access to more than
13,500 square miles of Soviet territory north of the Caspian Sea
near the Volga river, Loik Le Floch-Prigent told a news conference.
   He said it was the first full-scale exploration and production
deal that the Soviet Union has signed with a foreign oil company.
The Soviet government up to now has restricted such relationships
to technical assistance on the part of the foreign concern.
   The Elf president declined to say whether this meant the French
oil company and the Soviet government would be joint partners in
the venture, or whether Elf had been awarded an exclusive area in
which it could exploit oil and gas reserves.
   Le Floch-Prigent said details of the agreement, including the
method of marketing the oil and gas produced, remain to be worked
out.
   He said the Soviets will provide manpower, transport and
communications support, while Elf will furnish and manage the
technology used in the process in the same fashion that it runs
operations in other foreign countries.
   Le Floch-Prigent said he expected the agreement to lead to a
long-term collaboration, lasting 20 to 30 years, and that it could
lead to cooperation with the Soviet Union in other areas, including
refining, chemicals and cosmetics production.
   He provided no details on the financing of the exploration and
production project.

<HEAD>Can Get Once-Forbidden High-Tech Products After July 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western nations have agreed to lift
most Cold War-era restrictions on high-tech deliveries to East
Germany, officials said Wednesday. East Germany promised the goods
won't fall into the wrong hands.
   More than 380,000 Soviet troops are stationed in East Germany,
and Washington has made clear it is not ready to lift the ban on
many high-tech goods to Moscow.
   East German and West German officials announced that after their
two countries become a single economic entity on July 2, East
Germany will have access to a lot of high-tech products long barred
from the former Communist-run nation.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said that as of
that date, all goods ``with the exception of a small category of
highly sensitive technology'' can be shipped to East Germany
without export license or coordination with other members of the
COCOM group.
   The decision was made ``in close cooperation with our partners
in COCOM,'' Haussmann said in a statement.
   For the first time, East Germany will be able to legally obtain
Western-made telecommunications equipment, machine tools and other
goods, officials said.
   COCOM stands for the 17-nation Coordinating Commitee on
Multilateral Export Controls, which has worked together since the
Cold War days to try to keep the Warsaw Pact from obtaining
products that could be used for military purposes.
   The United States has previously said it has no objection to
easing restrictions for East European countries undertaking
democratic political reforms. Washington has indicated it wants to
keep more stringent rules for the Soviet Union itself.
   Haussmann said ``an important goal has been achieved'' with the
decision.
   ``Namely, making available to the GDR (East Germany) those
modern investment goods and technologies that it needs so that its
companies can compete with advanced industrial lands,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the East German government, Matthias Gehler,
said East Germany will strictly control access to the new products
and technology and assure ``that there is no misuse.''
   The West German Economics Ministry said among the items that
will still be banned for delivery to East Germany are submarine
technology and super computers.
   The United States and other COCOM nations have given their
informal approval to the change, the Economics Ministry said.
Formal approval is expected at a May 29 COCOM meeting in Paris.

   Stock prices drifted lower today as traders
cashed in some of the gains from the market's recent rise to record
highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.20 to
2,842.03 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outpaced gainers by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 627 up, 803 down and
525 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders for durable goods fell 4.1 percent in April, providing a
fresh sign of weakness in the economy.
   As the day passed, the news helped to foster a moderate decline
in interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose almost $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.56
percent-8.59 percent range.
   But brokers said bond traders seemed wary about chances for any
extensive further drop in rates over the near term.
   That in turn seemed to encourage the impulse among stock
investors to take profits after the Dow's rise Monday and Tuesday
to new closing peaks.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down { at 47&rsqb;;
Westinghouse Electric, down 1} at 34\; Deere &amp; Co., down 2\ at 73|,
and Philip Morris, down &lsqb; at 44~.
   Precious-metals issues tumbled as the price of gold fell. ASA
Ltd. lost 2 to 49{; Homestake Mining 1\ to 18{, and Newmont Gold 2
to 43.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .41 to 195.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off 1.29 at 358.56.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 118.96 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Stocks closed mostly lower in moderate trading on
London's Stock Exchange Wednesday, depressed by disappointing
British trade figures for April.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down
23.9 points, or 1 percent, at 2,287.4, well below the session high
of 2,335.1 posted ahead of the late morning release of the trade
figures.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 18.7 points at
1,810.8 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index was not
available because of technical problems.
   Volume totaled 542.1 million shares compared with 629.7 million
shares Tuesday.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $3.03 billion in
April from a revised $3.6 billion the previous month. But the
latest figure was worse than market expectations of a $2.6 billion
gap.

<TEXT>
   Many sons of famous corporate tycoons who take
over the family business do so with trepidation. Thomas J. Watson
Jr., son of longtime IBM Chairman Thomas J. Watson, was no
different.
   ``I'd heard so many stories about sons of prominent men failing
in business, and I could imagine their devastation at finding
themselves unable to fill their fathers' shoes. I worried I'd end
up the same way,'' Watson writes in his autobiography, ``Father,
Son &amp; Co.,'' which goes on sale Thursday.
   Needless to say, Watson did not fail.
   Watson's father had transformed International Business Machines
Corp. from an obscure tabulating machine company to a worldwide
powerhouse before he turned over control to his son in 1956. He
died a few months later at age 82.
   Watson Jr. furthered IBM's growth, leading it into the age of
computers _ an area his father originally shied away from.
   The book, co-authored with a Fortune magazine editor, Peter
Petre, provides a rare firsthand account of the coming of age of a
CEO and his company. Central to the story is the tense relationship
between Watson and his larger-than-life father.
   ``In public he would praise me lavisly ...,'' the 76-year-old
Watson writes. ``But in private father and I had terrible fights
that led us again and again to the brink of estrangement.''
   Watson left IBM in 1971 after suffering a heart attack at age
56. He later served as U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union and
remains IBM's chairman emeritus. He said in a telephone interview
that writing the book has allowed him to relive his life and to
clarify his relationship with his father.
   ``It's a love story. It is a story of a son who was terribly,
terribly fond of his father. But the son didn't know how to express
it,'' Watson said in the interview.
   ``He was the greatest man I ever knew.''
   Among the book's insights into Watson Sr.:
   _He ran IBM along the lines now associated with Japanese
companies. Employees sang company songs and recited company
slogans. Watson's favorite motto, ``THINK,'' was emblazoned on
posters and company newspapers, along with Watson's picture. But
Watson's son worried that his father was creating a personality
cult.
   _Watson Sr. believed that you got the best out of employees by
treating them with respect. ``IBM offered the best benefits money
could buy,'' his son writes, including education and company
country clubs. However, he was tough with IBM's managers, often
badgering them with obscure questions about IBM's operations.
   In the book, Watson Jr. describes himself as an aimless, spoiled
youth who partied his way through Brown University while barely
keeping his grades high enough to keep from being expelled.
   Watson decided to join IBM after college, despite having little
idea what he wanted to do with his life. He went through IBM's
sales training program, where he first became painfully aware of
how hard it was to be the boss's son.
   On his first sales call, a corporate executive gave him a
lecture on the difficulty of following his father's footsteps. He
told of one such young man who became a drunk from too much high
living and was fired by his father.
   ``I was tempted to abandon my IBM career on the spot,'' Watson
writes.
   But he perservered, and rose to become IBM's top salesman after
a lucrative account was added to his sales territory to make him
look good. The achievement won him headlines in the company
newspaper. ``I felt demeaned,'' Watson writes. ``Everyone knew that
I was the old man's son, and that otherwise I never could have sold
so much in such a short time.''
   Watson escaped the pressures of IBM and his father for several
years by flying for the Air Force during World War II. But at the
war's end, he decided to return to his father's company.
   Watson rose quickly, and was named president in 1952. But he
never escaped the heavy hand of his father as IBM entered a period
of explosive growth.
   ``I don't think my father realized how far he was pushing me,''
Watson writes. ``There were times when I wondered if I was going to
have a nervous breakdown.''
   In 1956, Watson was preparing to sail in a yacht race when he
was called back to New York. His father was in the hospital, and
soon died.
   Watson ran the company on his own for five years. But in 1961,
he relinquished the job of president to prepare for an eventual
successor. He kept the job of chief executive and also became
chairman.
   That period led to what Watson Jr. calls the biggest mistake of
his life. Watson believed that his younger brother, Dick, who was
in charge of IBM's international operations, would be his natural
successor as chief executive. But instead of preparing Dick for the
job outright, he set him up in a competition with other executives.
   Dick Watson ran into trouble during the launch of a computer
line that was crucial to IBM's future. The project was severely
behind schedule. Watson decided his brother just couldn't handle
the job and gave it to another executive. That put Dick Watson out
of the running for president.
   ``I felt nothing but shame and frustration at the way I'd
treated him,'' Watson writes.
   Watson says he never regrets leaving IBM before retirement age.
Having a heart attack made him realize how much he had been pushing
himself.
   ``I've never missed IBM as IBM,'' he said in the interview.
``I've just missed things to do sometimes.''
   Watson, who has six daughters and a son, also doesn't regret the
fact that none of them is involved with the company today. He said
he didn't want them to feel the pressure he felt from his father.
   ``I don't think I ever thought of them working at IBM,'' he said.

<HEAD>Say First Quarter Profits Rise 39 Pct on Extraordinary Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC reported a 39 percent gain in
first-quarter earnings Wednesday, largely because of a one-time
gain resulting from an antitakeover strategy that helped repulse a
hostile takeover bid.
   On a pretax basis, the British conglomerate said earnings sank
27 percent because of winter storm-related claims at BAT's Eagle
Star insurance unit.
   BAT said earnings for the three months ended March 31 totaled
$445 million, vs. $320 million in the same period a year earlier
when there were no extraordinary items. It said pretax earnings
totaled $393 million, down from $541 million.
   Sales rose 6.5 percent to $8.7 billion from $8.1 billion. Sales
gains by the group's tobacco and other interests offset a slight
overall decline in financial services, the company said.
   Chairman Patrick Sheehy said the first quarter ``will not be
representative of the year as a whole. I expect the group to be
able to make solid progress in what is very much a transitional
year.''
   BAT is completing the disposal of several large U.S. retail
stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's, and the
spinoff of its huge paper and pulp manufacturer, Wiggins Teape
Appleton.
   These were among various measures taken to fend off a hostile
takeover from financier Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments
group, which bid $22.7 billion for the company last year. The
Anglo-French financier and his fellow investors dropped the offer
in April because of regulatory frustrations.
   BAT said its reshaping plan yielded a $243 million extraordinary
gain in the quarter, the result of the sale of its 69 percent
interest in V.G. Instruments PLC.
   The figures were converted at the current exchange rate of $1.70
to the pound.

<TEXT>
   A judge has approved a $13 million
settlement for shareholders of SmithKline Beckman Corp. who sued
the company last year after it announced a merger with the Beecham
Group PLC.
   The $13 million will be paid to shareholders of SmithKline who
held shares between April 10, 1989, when the merger was first
announced, and July 26, 1989, when the deal was consummated and
SmithKline Beecham was formed.
   The approval by Common Pleas Court Judge I. Raymond Kremer on
Tuesday will benefit about 25,000 shareholders.
   Dianne M. Nast, one of several attorneys representing
shareholders in the case, said distribution of the proceeds would
begin in 30 days if no appeals are filed. The $13 million will be
prorated based on the number of shares held by each member of the
class.
   Nearly two dozen attorneys representing the shareholders will
share a separate $1.9 million as reimbursement for their services
in the case, Nast said.
   Beginning on April 12, 1989, nine lawsuits were filed against
SmithKline Beckman, its officers and directors and Beecham Group.
The cases were later consolidated.
   The suits alleged that SmithKline ``has engaged in conduct which
has been detrimental to its shareholders.''
   Among the allegations in the suits were accusations that the
individual defendants had failed in their duty to seek potential
buyers for SmithKline at a higher price than that offered by
Beecham.

<HEAD>Settle Lawsuit Over Jet Engine Design</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric on Wednesday announced
a settlement of its $1.15 billion breach-of-contract suit against
Daimler-Benz, the West German technology giant working with both GE
and its fiercest U.S. rival in designing jet engines.
   GE's lawsuit claimed that Daimler's new alliance with Pratt &amp;
Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., breached an
agreement it already had with GE to develop high-thrust engines for
jumbo jets.
   Under the settlement, currently pending in U.S. District Court
in New York, Motoren und Turbinen Union, the aerospace division of
Daimler-Benz, will be free to continue its cooperation with Pratt &amp;
Whitney on the high-thrust PW4000 engine, GE said in a press
release.
   In return, Daimler-Benz and MTU agreed to drop out of GE's
parallel venture _ the development of the GE90 engine, GE said.
Daimler-Benz also agreed to return to GE any trade secrets it has
gained so far from its cooperation in the GE90 program and to keep
confidential all other proprietary information it has gained from
cooperating with GE.
   Daimler-Benz also agreed to renegotiate its contract with GE
under which the companies cooperate in designing smaller engines to
power most large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and the
McDonnell Douglas MD-11.
   GE said the renegotiation of that contract will provide it with
``significant'' additional revenues from the sales of engines and
parts.
   GE spokesman George Jamison would not estimate the value of the
renegotiation. David Franus, an aerospace industry analyst for
Forecast International in Newtown, Conn., said the renegotiation
could be worth as much as $500 million to GE over the next 15 years.
   That arrangement gives GE a partner in what is now the most
lucrative slice of the jet engine industry. Most large commercial
aircraft are powered by engines that range in power from 50,000
pounds of thrust to 75,000.
   But the industry's giants are scrambling to develop larger,
high-thrust engines to power the bigger, wider commercial aircraft
of the future, and the settlement leaves GE without a partner in
that venture.
   ``It still comes with that slap in the face _ that for engines
over 75,000 pounds of thrust, GE has lost a longtime partner,''
Franus said. ``GE is going to have to scramble to find other
partners.''
   Another industry analyst, Paul Turk of Virginia-based Avmark,
said GE faces only minimal risk of losing trade secrets to Pratt &amp;
Whitney.
   ``That's a short-term concern,'' he said. ``These things change
twice a week.''
   He said most of the inside information from GE that would be of
value to Pratt &amp; Whitney would be financial rather than
technological, and would probably not differ significantly from
Pratt &amp; Whitney's own information.
   UTC spokesman Dan Harrison said the Hartford-based company would
have no comment on the lawsuit, in which it was not a party. He
added that UTC and Daimler-Benz are still working out the details
of their alliance.
   When GE first filed the lawsuit, Harrison said neither UTC nor
Pratt &amp; Whitney ``needs, wants or would accept confidential GE
information.''

<TEXT>
   Operators of a Finnish shipyard concealed financial
troubles before collapsing in bankrupcty with millions of dollars
worth of unfinished work, a major cruise line alleged Wednesday.
   Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. is seeking $700 million from two
Finland-based companies that owned Wartsila Marine Industries Inc.,
which filed for bankrupcty last November before completing a
three-ship contract for Carnival.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, claims
Miami-based Carnival suffered $400 million in additional
construction costs and lost passenger bookings. The suit also seeks
$300 million in punitive damages from Oy Wartsila Ab and Valmet Oy
Ab.
   In 1987, Carnival signed a $600 million contract with Wartsila
for three 2,600-passenger ships. But the bankruptcy halted all work
at the Helsinki yard, which was taken over by several shipowners,
the Union Bank of Finland and the Finnish government.
   The new yard, renamed Masa-Yards, completed work on the Fantasy,
which began service March 2. The Ecstasy is under construction at
Masa-Yards and scheduled for delivery in April 1991.
   Carnival, which has an 11 percent stake in Masa, is looking at
several European shipyards for the Sensation, the third vessel from
the Wartsila contract, said company spokesman Tim Gallagher.
   The suit alleges the two companies misrepresented the financial
condition of the Wartsila yard in order to get the Carnival
contract. Among the allegations is that Warstila principals
transferred overvalued assets and hid losses from some shipbuilding
contracts.
   Carnival attorney Lewis Clayton said Wednesday he did not know
whether the defendants had hired attorneys in the United States.
Officials at the two companies could not immediately be reached in
Finland for comment.
   Carnival recently signed a $700 million contract with
Fincantierri Shipyards of Trieste, Italy, for three vessels for its
Holland America Line subsidiary.
   Carnival, which presently operates 15 ships worldwide, blamed
ship-refurbishing projects for a 46 percent decline in
first-quarter profits this year.
   Income for the quarter fell to $25.2 million, or 19 cents a
share, compared with $46.3 million, or 34 cents a share, for the
same period last year. During the period, two ships were tied up
for maintenance and improvements.
   Revenues for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose to $259.4 million
from $231.8 million, the company said.

   Wheat futures prices closed mostly lower while
corn and soybeans advanced modestly in quiet trading Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders were cautious amid the uncertainty over future sales of
U.S. grain to China and the Soviet Union.
   The Bush administration is expected to announce soon whether it
will renew China's favorable trade status. Analysts say economic
woes in the Soviet Union could force Moscow to reduce grain imports.
   The two nations are among the largest foreign buyers of U.S.
agricultural products.
   Pessimism about export sales was offset in the corn and soybean
markets, though, by reports of more rain in the Midwest. Heavy
precipitation during the past two weeks has slowed the pace of corn
and soybean planting and further delays could affect crop yields,
especially for corn.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to { cent higher

   Stock prices lost ground today as traders cashed
in some of the gains from the market's recent rise to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.15 to
2,841.08 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outpaced gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 653 up, 809 down and
516 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders for durable goods fell 4.1 percent in April, providing a
fresh sign of weakness in the economy.
   As the day passed, the news helped to foster a moderate decline
in interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose almost $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.56
percent-8.59 percent range.
   But brokers said bond traders seemed wary about chances for any
extensive further drop in rates over the near term.
   That in turn seemed to encourage the impulse among stock
investors to take profits after the Dow's rise Monday and Tuesday
to new closing peaks.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down { at 47&rsqb;;
Westinghouse Electric, down 1\ at 34}; Deere &amp; Co., down 2~ at 73,
and Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at 44|.
   Precious-metals issues tumbled as the price of gold fell. ASA
Ltd. lost 2 to 49{; Homestake Mining 1\ to 18{, and Newmont Gold 1|
to 43&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .51 to 195.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off 1.06 at 358.79.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 142.80 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Running Big Blue is an even tougher job today,
concedes former Chairman Thomas J. Watson Jr.
   Watson details the challenges of his 15 years at the helm of
International Business Machines Corp. in his newly released
autobiography, ``Father, Son &amp; Co.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said the demands
of the job have grown considerably for current IBM chief John F.
Akers.
   ``I had real trouble managing $7 billion (in annual revenue),
and he's managing $70 billion,'' Watson said.
   Another fundamental change: The company has shifted its focus
from rentals to sales, Watson said.
   In 1956, when Watson took over from his father, Thomas J.
Watson, nearly all of IBM's machines were rented. By selling
one-year rental and maintenance contracts, instead of the machines
themselves, IBM was guaranteed a steady annual revenue stream,
Watson said.
   ``With rental, you didn't have to sell anything. As long as you
kept them (customers) satisfied, then you got the same rental this
year as next year,'' he said. ``It makes for a much steadier
financial base.''
   But that comforting arrangement was challenged by an antitrust
suit filed by the federal government in 1952. Settling the suit
required IBM to start selling some of its machines, recalled
Watson, who retired from IBM in 1971. Watson says the computer
industry has changed dramatically since his departure. One of the
most profound changes is the miniaturization of electronic
components that culminated in the development of microprocessors,
or computers on a silicon chip, which weren't commercially
available until several years after Watson left IBM.
   ``It was thrilling for me to see us move into electronics, but I
had never any idea that somebody could give me something an eighth
of an inch square and maybe an inch long and say that could store a
400-page book,'' he said, describing a device he was shown on a
recent visit to an IBM facility.
   Watson says he has full confidence in IBM's current management
despite the company's lower profits of recent years and increasing
competition from upstart competitors. But he says he's glad he left
the business when he did.
   ``Perhaps the industry was the best at the time to be in,'' he
said of his tenure. ``Ten years earlier, it wouldn't have been an
industry, and 20 years later it would have been terribly difficult,
as it is today.''

<HEAD>UAW's Short And Mostly Sweet Convention Sends Good Signal To
Automakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A short, and mostly sweet, United Auto
Workers bargaining-strategy convention is sending a good signal to
the nation's Big Three automakers, analysts said Wednesday. But
that doesn't mean the summer bargaining will be a cakewalk.
   Delegates to the two-day meeting approved 120 pages of
resolutions laying an agenda for the union's three bargaining
committees. Talks between the union and General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. open in July. The contracts expire
Sept. 14.
   Officials of each of the Big Three automakers declined to
comment Wednesday on specific UAW bargaining positions.
   UAW President Owen Bieber outlined five priorities for the
union's negotiators: job security, wage improvements, maintaining
health-care benefits, pension improvements and making management
more accountable to workers.
   ``They seem pretty rational, they are not asking for the moon,''
said auto analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.
``I think they have finally come to grips with the reality of the
situation _ the degree of competition that exists in the automotive
world and particularly in the United States.''
   During the 1980s, the role of the Big Three on the world's
automotive stage changed drastically, mostly because competition
from Japan-based automakers eroded their dominance. As the
companies' roles changed, so did the UAW's.
   Membership in the nation's largest industrial union dropped from
a peak of about 1.5 million in the mid-1970s to about 1 million
today. The UAW's leadership in the U.S. labor movement,
particularly in setting model contracts for other heavy industries,
has eroded.
   Consequently, the general priorities of the UAW have changed
from wages and benefits to job security.
   ``Clearly, there is one key issue, and that's job security,''
said auto analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   Job security's emergence as the No. 1 bargaining issue was no
surprise at the convention Monday and Tuesday.
   ``Fact number one is that we have a more urgent need for job
security and a more legitimate claim to job and income security for
our members ... than at any previous time in our history,'' Bieber
said Monday.
   Current contracts with the UAW permit plant closings only when
products made at the factory suffer a sales slump. GM and Chrysler
have used that clause to justify closing eight assembly plants and
laying off 17,000 employees during the past three years.
   ``We must compel them (automakers) to retain all current workers
unless their ability to survive is severely at risk as a result of
conditions beyond their control,'' Bieber said in a speech to the
convention.
   Just what causes such a financial hardship may be a bone of
contention in itself, said Brady, the Oppenheimer analyst.
   ``Keeping a plant operating when it's not productive is a
financial hardship,'' he said. ``I think the more enlightened
members of the union have said the only real way to job security is
to get the consumer to demand our product.''
   UAW bargainers also are going to have to pay attention to the
446,000 retirees carried on pension rolls. Most of the debate at
the UAW convention centered on providing cost-of-living
adjustments, or COLAs, for retirees.
   The proposal puts Bieber and the UAW leadership in a tough spot.
Members are demanding it, but Bieber knows, as automakers have
said, that COLAs for retirees are extremely expensive. Some
estimates put the cost at more than $1 billion a year for the Big
Three.
   If such a proposal were adopted, other contractual benefits
would be cut, some have contended.
   Bieber told delegates he didn't want bargaining committees
handcuffed by proposing a cost-of-living adjustment as the only
inflation hedge for retirees.
   Auto analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said he was
optimistic about the upcoming contract talks.
   ``What struck me about the demands is that never before have we
had so much potential for easy agreement when it comes to
pension,'' he said. ``I think management will give some kind of
inflation protection, some kind of lump-sum payment.''
   He said the atmosphere at the convention modified his thought of
a month or so ago that a UAW strike was more likely this year than
in recent years.
   ``The leadership ultimately has to be responsive to the rank and
file,'' Merlis said. ``And with the lack of dissidents, the odds of
a meaningful strike become much less likely.''

   Crude oil prices tumbled in frenzied trading
Wednesday as dealers worried that continued overproduction from
OPEC members would result in a worldwide oil glut.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped
78 cents to settle at $18.14 a 42-gallon barrel, after falling as
low as $17.95 at one point Wednesday. Other contract months also
fell sharply.
   The June WTI contract, which expired Tuesday, had declined 58
cents in that session.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at Elders Futures Inc., said
signs of a possible oil glut already are emerging, making oil
traders nervous.
   He noted that northwestern Europe is being flooded with crude
from Iran, and that the Trans-Panama pipeline has run out of
storage space for crude.
   In addition, a report released late Tuesday by the American
Petroleum Institute said crude oil stocks had reached a
larger-than-expected 4.4-million barrel buildup at the end of last
week.
   Beutel said last week's stock levels were the highest in about
eight years. Traders weren't optimistic about reducing the current
oversupply of oil. Members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries earlier this month agreed to production cuts,
but the cartel's output has not fallen enough to move oil prices
higher.
   Among refined petroleum prices traded Wednesday on the New York
Merc, the June contract for wholesale heating oil fell 1.19 cents
to 50.21 cents a gallon, after losing 0.04 cent Tuesday.
   June unleaded gasoline settled at 62.51 cents a gallon, down
0.53 cent. The contract had fallen 0.31 cent Tuesday.
   In natural gas trading, the July contract fell to $1.602 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.613 Tuesday.

   Stock prices inched ahead on the strength of
some late buying Wednesday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial
average to its third straight record closing high.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips rose 4.03 to 2,856.26,
extending its gain over the last three sessions to 36.35 points.
   Advancing issues and declines were about evenly balanced in the
overall tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 753 up, 739 down
and 517 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that new
factory orders for durable goods fell 4.1 percent in April,
providing a fresh sign of weakness in the economy.
   As the day passed, the news helped to foster a moderate decline
in interest rates. Prices of long-term government bonds rose almost
$5 for each $1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.57
percent-8.60 percent range.
   Still, brokers said bond traders seemed wary about chances for
any extensive further drop in rates over the near term.
   That in turn seemed to encourage the impulse among stock
investors to cash in a few of the market's recent gains.
   Precious-metals issues tumbled as the price of gold fell $11.50
an ounce to $364.60 on the Commodity Exchange in New York amid talk
of gold sales by major investors in the Middle East.
   ASA Ltd. lost 2&rsqb; to 49&lsqb;; Homestake Mining 1{ to 18\; Placer Dome
1 to 16&lsqb;; American Barrick Resources 1 to 18{, and Newmont Gold 1{

   Donaldson Co. rose 2} to 30. Late Tuesday the company posted

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Gold Futures Tumble On Second Big Mideast Sale This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices tumbled to seven-month lows Wednesday on New
York's Commodity Exchange amid frantic selling prompted by a cash
sale of an estimated 10 to 30 tons of the metal by Middle Eastern
interests.
   The plunge of more than $11 an ounce shook the confidence of
investors who had begun returning to the gold market aftr being
burned by a similar but even steeper drop two months ago.
   On other commodity markets, crude oil futures fell sharply; pork
futures plummeted; and grain and soybean futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $11.80 to $13.10 lower in New York, with
the contract for delivery in June at $364.60 a troy ounce, the
lowest settlement of a near-month contract since Oct. 13.
   Silver futures ended 5.3 cents to 5.7 cents lower on the
Commodity Exchange with May at $5.23 a troy ounce; platinum futures
settled $6.30 to $6.70 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with July at $498.20 a troy ounce.
   The large Middle Eastern sell order, which some analysts believe
originated in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, coincided with the opening of
the London gold market and triggered so much sympathetic selling
that dealers were unable to agree on a morning price fix until
nearly 2{ hours after trading began.
   Like the March 26 event _ which involved a sale of an estimated
94 to 125 tons _ the Middle Eastern order seemed designed to shock
the market, possibly to abort a fledgling rally. Gold prices rose
about $5 an ounce last week and gained more than $2 Tuesday.
   ``I'm not so sure it was done because they needed to sell but
because they needed to drive the market,'' said John Jonat, a gold
trader with Deak International Inc., a large currency and precious
metal dealer.
   But other analysts said the sale may have been prompted by a
need for cash to buy arms.
   Investment interest in gold has been notably slack since the
March 26 collapse. But the market's recent strength appeared to
again be attracting the public sector.
   ``Yesterday, they began to get some faith again but that shifted
today _ very quickly,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Crude oil prices crumbled in frenzied trading on the New York
Merc amid concern that continued OPEC overproduction could lead to
a worldwide oil glut.
   Analyst Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. said northwestern
Europe is being flooded with crude from Iran, and the Trans-Panama
pipeline has run out of storage space for crude.
   In addition, a report released late Tuesday by the American
Petroleum Institute said crude oil stocks rose last week by a
larger-than-expected 4.4 million barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 78 cents
lower with July at $18.14 a barrel; heating oil was .67 cent to
1.19 cents lower with June at 50.21 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .45 cent to .65 cent lower with June at 62.51 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Selling was centered in the hog and pork-belly
pits, where some contracts plunged their permitted daily limits in
line with weakness in the cash markets.
   Pork bellies were further pressured by the exchange's weekly
report Tuesday on out-of-town stocks. The report showed an
unexpected increase of 630,000 pounds of bellies in commercial
freezers outside of Chicago.
   Live cattle futures settled .25 cent to .80 cent lower with June
at 73.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent lower to .08
cent higher with May at 85.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .40
cent to the limit 1.5 cents lower with June at 65.70 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .85 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with
July at 67.15 cents a pound. The May contract expired at 67.40
cents, off 2 cents.
   Wheat futures prices closed mostly lower while corn and soybeans
advanced modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade amid uncertainty
over future sales of U.S. grain to China and the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents lower to { cent higher with July
at $3.33} a bushel; corn futures were 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher
with July at $2.76\ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent higher

<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. is rolling, but with mounting
financial problems and an unresolved strike, bankruptcy court could
be the bus company's next stop.
   With its nearly 3-month-old drivers' strike eating up cash
reserves, the company is struggling to pay bills and is about 60
days behind in most payments.
   It needs an immediate infusion of cash to buy back junk bonds
from investors at a deep discount and reduce expenses.
   ``The question is: who steps up to the plate,'' said one
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Banks are very
cautious. I don't think the union problems will go away. I don't
think the bondholders are going to roll over and play dead.''
   P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president,
answered Wednesday: ``There're lots of very wealthy investors that
are interested in investing in small companies that they can earn a
good return on. A number of those are very sophisticated about
unions and the risks inherent in our particular situation.''
   Lannie said the company is meeting with various investors to
line up financing for the bond buyback announced Monday.
   Greyhound said it would purchase up to 85 percent of the face
value of $225 million worth of high-yield debt at steep discounts.
One of the conditions of the offer, however, was obtaining
financing, plus additional working capital.
   Lannie said Greyhound figures it needs to borrow between $125
million and $150 million to swing the deal, although he points out
that the company is committed to repurchasing only 51 percent of
the bonds.
   Without the refinancing, the company likely will be forced to
seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy court because of
losses from a bus drivers' walkout that began March 2. Chairman
Fred G. Currey estimates the strike will end up costing Greyhound
between $75 million and $100 million.
   Greyhound lost $56 million in the first quarter and last week
missed a $9.75 million interest payment on its most senior debt.
Combined with its failure to make about $5 million in lease
payments at the end of April, the company has opened the door for
creditors to begin the process of forcing it into bankruptcy. Such
a move could come as early as June 14, although the company says
its bondholders have not indicated they will demand payment.
   Lannie said he believes about 70 percent of the bonds are held
by investors who purchased them in secondary markets, meaning that
the company's offer of 54 cents or 27.5 cents on the dollar
represents a fair profit on their investments.
   Some analysts question whether so many of the bonds have been
sold by their original investors, who are unlikely to be happy with
the prices offered.
   Greyhound's chances are further clouded by a finding this month
by an official with the National Labor Relations Board, who said
the company engaged in an unfair labor practice by implementing a
contract on the day the union walked out.
   The finding, plus the union's offer Tuesday to return to work,
sets the stage for a legal battle that could end with the company
being forced to rehire union drivers and pay $10 million a month in
back wages.
   Greyhound has been operating at reduced levels since the strike,
using newly hired drivers plus crossovers. Earlier this month,
Currey said the strike had become irrelevant because Greyhound had
enough drivers to operate.
   On Tuesday, Greyhound said it had reached its highest level of
ridership since the strike began, as it carried 91,666 passengers,
or 80 percent of the same day last year. The company is nearing the
end of a two-week, half-price fare promotion that it credits for
the surge in ridership.
   Whatever financing Greyhound ends up with will almost certainly
come from a private placement with an investor demanding a
lucrative return for the risk, Lannie said.
   ``They're going to want somewhere between 25 and 30 percent
return,'' he said, ``and how they get it will be a matter for their
creativity.''
   He did not rule out giving up equity in the company as an
enticement for new money, and most analysts expect an investor to
demand equity in the company. Some suggest Currey will not be able
to retain his position as chairman.
   ``The type of ideal would be someone who's willing to make a
loan at an aggressive interest rate, but also with a big equity
kicker,'' said Leigh Walzer at R.D. Smith &amp; Co. in New York. ``No
one's going to do this as a straight coupon investment.''
   Greyhound already has been turned down by one equity holder _
Greyhound Dial Corp. of Phoenix, its original owner.
   The bus company was created three years ago when an investor
group led by Currey paid Greyhound Corp. _ as it was then called _
$270 million for its bus operations.
   Lannie said the bus company had made a ``direct request'' to
Greyhound Dial, but was turned down.

   Gold prices plunged worldwide Wednesday,
reaching a seven-month low in domestic trading, as reports of heavy
Mideast selling brought chaos to the morning fixing session in
London and triggered a sympathetic selloff in the United States.
   The dollar, meanwhile, ended mixed against major foreign
currencies after falling slightly overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold tumbled $11.50 to
settle at $364.10 a troy ounce, after losing about $11 an ounce in
Europe. Gold had been as low as $360 an ounce on the exchange
before rebounding somewhat.
   Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$363.95 an ounce, down $10.55 from late Tuesday.
   The last time gold was near the $364 level was in October,
according to William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures
Inc.
   Market watchers said gold's nose dive was triggered by one huge
sell order from Saudi Arabia. They said the Saudis are believed to
have sold between 10 tons and 30 tons of gold, and some speculated
that the proceeds may be earmarked for arms purchases from Britian.
   The Saudis also are believed to have been responsible for a
similar sharp drop in gold prices two months ago, according to
analysts and traders.
   Bernard Savaiko, a senior metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc.,
said gold had been overbought in recent weeks, though, and traders
were preparing for a ``correction'' of sorts.
   ``Because of the lack of buyers, the large sell order had a
profound impact on gold prices,'' Savaiko said.
   The Saudi sale resulted in an order imbalance in Europe and
ultimately brought chaos to the morning London fixing session. The
five leading London dealers that set the fixing spent a near-record
2{ hours trying to set a price after having trouble matching demand
and supply. The fixing was finally set at $363.25 a troy ounce.
   The fixing, often used as a guideline for traders, is an average
price calculated twice a day based on market demand.
   ``Nobody had a chance to get out of positions,'' during the
fixing, said a Zurich dealer. ``And no business was possible.''
   Dealers said market sentiment was that gold eventually had to
fall back after approaching the $378-an-ounce level. But as one
dealer in Zurich explained, ``This decline wasn't predictable.''
   Trading was more subdued in foreign exchange. Activity was
diminishing with the approach of Thursday's Ascension Day holiday
in continental Europe and Monday's Memorial Day Holiday in the
United States. Monday also is a public holiday in Britain.
   Traders said technical factors were largely responsible for the
dollar's movement Wednesday.
   In the spotlight again was the Canadian dollar, which has been
under pressure in recent days. Canada's Progressive Conservative
government was thrown into turmoil after a senior cabinet minister
resigned amid growing doubts about the future of a constitutional
reform package.
   The Canadian dollar did regain some strength Wednesday in Europe
and New York.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell
1.05 yen to a closing 151.35 yen. It traded at 150.90 yen in
London, and at 151.45 yen in New York, up from 151.25 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound compared to
Tuesday. Sterling rose to $1.6975 from $1.6915 in London, and to
$1.6940 from $1.6930 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6760 West German marks, up from
1.67315; 1.4175 Swiss francs, down from 1.41765; 5.6400 French
francs, up from 5.6300; 1,229.00 Italian lire, up from 1,228.00;
and 1.18415 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18735.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday, included:
1.6682 West German marks, down from 1.6685; 1.4065 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4175; 5.6125 French francs, down from 5.6175; 1.8740
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8760; 1,223.00 Italian lire, down from
1,225.25; and 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1907.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
settled at $5.230 a troy ounce, down 5.3 cents from late Tuesday.
Silver rose in London to $5.24 an ounce from $5.19.

   When word leaked out that Ivan F. Boesky would
be taking the witness stand in Manhattan's federal court, news
photographers and television crews staked out the steps for a shot
of the infamous stock speculator.
   But so far, no one has been able to get a picture because Boesky
did not make an appearance outside the courthouse in two days of
testimony.
   Although court security officials would not discuss Boesky, it
was believed that he was granted the unusual right to enter and
exit through an underground garage.
   Boesky, who began his testimony Monday, is a government witness
against former friend John A. Mulheren Jr., who is being tried on
securities fraud charges.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, laying
groundwork for the expected renewal of trade benefits to China,
said Wednesday that human rights ``should not be the only factor''
in such a decision.
   ``The real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you decide
you're not going to extend it,'' Baker told a White House news
conference.
   He said ending China's most-favored-nation status, as many in
Congress are suggesting, would harm ``significant and substantial''
U.S. economic interests.
   Administration and congressional sources said Bush would
formally announce his decision to extend the trade benefits to
Beijing for one year on Thursday.
   Even before the announcement, the move has provoked angry
outcries from congressional critics who consider Bush too
accomodating toward the current regime in Beijing.
   Although he stopped short of actually announcing Bush's
decision, Baker rattled off a list of reasons to justify extension
of the preferential trade status.
   ``You should consider the effect of this upon the reformers in
the Chinese government, people that want to take China toward more
openness and toward more democratization. You ought to consider, I
would think, the effect on some very significant and substantial
economic interests that the United States has, the effect on Hong
Kong,'' Baker said.
   Most-favored-nation status gives China the same trade benefits,
including lowest-possible tariffs, that the United States extends
to its major trading partners.
   Supporters of extending the most-favored-nation status
frequently cite China's connection to Hong Kong.
   The free-market enclave on the coast of South China, now under
British control, serves as a middleman between much of the trade
between the United States and China.
   Some $8.5 billion in Hong Kong's exports to the United States
each year are actually products made in China _ and would be
subject to sharply higher tariffs if the trade benefits are
withdrawn.
   At the same time, Baker cited a ``disappointing lack of
progress'' on human rights since the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square
crackdown.
   However, he said the administration welcomed China's ``release
recently of 211 detainees, the lifting of martial law in Tibet''
and what he called ``a general indication of willingness to take
steps such as that.''
   But, Baker said, ``you ought not to draw that type of linkage.
The real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you decide that
you're not going to extend it _ and what are the consquences of
terminating it.''
   ``That's the way you ought to look at this _ not so much what
has been done in the one year period since Tiananamen. Although
that's one of the factors, it should not be the only factor.''
   The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia postponed a
hearing that had been planned for Wednesday to explore China's
trade status with Richard Solomon, an assistant secretary of State.
The hearing was rescheduled for Thursday afternoon.
   The office of subcommittee Chairman Steven Solarz, D-N.Y., said
the administration asked for the postponement because they weren't
ready to testify on the issue.

<TEXT>
   English-language radio broadcast rights to
the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, have been awarded to
the NBC Radio Networks, a division of Westwood One Inc., it was
announced Wednesday.
   Westwood One was awarded the rights by the NBC television
network, which has exclusive English-language broadcast rights to
the games and will televise them.
   Westwood One, the nation's second-largest radio network owner
after Capital Cities-ABC Inc., paid $50 million for NBC's radio
networks in 1987. NBC TV, a division of General Electric Co., also
had the broadcast rights to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul,
South Korea, and worked closely with Westwood One, which handled
radio broadcasts of those games.
   Terms of the latest agreement with NBC TV were not announced.
The deal involved both money and joint promotions and marketing,
said William J. Battison, Westwood One's president and chief
financial officer.
   He said NBC had put the rights up for bid to other radio
networks, but Westwood One had the inside track, ``largely because
of the job we did in 1988.''
   Westwood One's other divisions, the Westwood One Radio Networks,
the Mutual Broadcasting System, The Source and Talknet, will help
promote the broadcasts.

   Nearly 9,000 four-slice toasters will be
replaced because a defective switch poses a fire hazard or could
burn or severely shock users, the manufacturer said Wednesday.
   Toastmaster Inc. of Columbia, Mo., told the Consumer Product
Safety Commission it will replace 8,857 of its model D126T toasters
because the defective switch allows the electric heating elements
to continue operating after the toasting cycle has been completed.
   ``There have been no reports of injuries or fires ... as a
result of switch failure,'' the commission said in a written
statement.
   The chrome-based toasters were manufactured and sold nationwide
between April and June 1989. The Toastmaster name appears on a
black and silver nameplate in the lower right-hand corner of each
toaster.
   Consumers should also check the crumb tray at the bottom of the
toaster for a five-letter and digit date code enumerated from EL101
to EL158.
   The CPSC said no other Toastmaster products were involved in the
recall.
   Consumers may call the company at 1-800-527-3069 for
instructions on returning the toasters.

<HEAD>Chicago Exchanges Moving Toward Electronic Trading Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange said Wednesday they have reached a tentative
agreement to share an electronic trading system.
   The announcement by the world's two biggest commodity exchanges
came one day after the Merc announced Japanese government approval
of its proposed Globex electronic trading system.
   Japanese participation is perceived as the linchpin of Globex,
which would allow traders to buy and sell certain financial futures
even when the exchange itself is closed.
   Globex is a joint venture of the Merc and London-based Reuters
Holdings PLC, which is supplying the computer terminals and other
technology through its worldwide market-information network.
   The Board of Trade has been developing a separate electronic
trading system called Aurora.
   The exchanges didn't make clear if the tentative agreement would
produce a single electronic exchange or establish links between the
two systems.
   The exchanges began talking a year ago about the possibility of
offering both trading systems on the same terminals to reduce costs
for the exchanges and for traders who want access to both systems.
   The exchanges said committees of technical and legal
representatives had been formed to hammer out a formal agreement.
   The system could begin operating by November, they said.

   Shareholders of Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
angrily called for several top officers to resign Wednesday because
of last year's $551.4 million loss and the rejection of a takeover
offer from another utility holding company.
   Some of the more than 1,000 shareholders who packed a hotel
ballroom for the annual meeting also voiced anger over the
company's suspension last October of quarterly stock dividends.
   Two of about 20 who reached microphones after the conclusion of
business remembered the promise of vice president Henry B. Sargent
at last year's meeting that dividends were safe.
   ``We have a chief financial officer who earns $300,000 a year,
keeps the books and who ... is so inept that he can't do the job
properly. I ask that you fire him summarily,'' shareholder Peter
Ranke told new chief executive and chairman, Richard Snell.
   Others called for the resignations of directors Keith Turley,
who retired as CEO Feb. 5, and Carl Eller, whose expansion of
Circle K Corp. drove the convenience-store chain to file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection May 15. Eller resigned as Circle
K's chairman and CEO eight days before the filing.
   Turley left the room after the meeting without commenting, but
Eller told reporters he had no intention of resigning.
   ``I have been on the board a long time, and I have contributed
as much as I can,'' he said.
   Snell was booed and called a liar for defending the credentials
of directors. One shareholder yelled out from the audience, ``Fire
Snell.''
   The chairman said he could not ask directors to resign because
they were elected by shareholders.
   Formal business was completed quickly: approval of minutes, the
re-election of incumbent directors and rejection of a shareholder
proposal to force board members to hold at least 2,000 shares of
Pinnacle West stock.
   The proposal received only 14 percent approval, company officers
said.
   Jeanne Rossi of Boonville, Calif., who offered the idea, said it
would instill loyalty in a board she called ``mediocre, at best.''
   Snell told reporters later that he expected most of the
criticism but was surprised by the sniping at Sargent, who is
respected in the utility industry, and at the salaries and
retirement packages of top management.
   ``It's easy to look at those numbers and be affronted by them,
but it is almost impossible to attract the people you need without
a golden parachute, and if you don't have it, the headhunters come
and take them away,'' he said.
   Snell defended the company's rejection Tuesday of a fourth
takeover offer from PacifiCorp as inadequate. The Portland,
Ore.-based utility offered $21 a share or $1.82 billion, a premium
of more than 25 percent of the market price.
   Complaints about Tuesday's rejection reflected more on the
effectiveness of a $200,000 PacifiCorp advertising campaign than
the offer itself, he said.
   In his address to shareholders, Snell acknowledged problems from
a five-year expansion that saw the company acquire uranium-mining,
real-estate and banking subsidiaries, but said the company was on a
``clear path'' to recovery. He noted the company recently sold a
resort and is close to finishing the sale of its unprofitable
Malapai Resource Co. mining subsidiary.
   Pinnacle West's 1986 purchase of MeraBank, the state's largest
thrift, nearly proved Pinnacle West's undoing, Snell said. MeraBank
lost more than $200 million in 1988 and 1989. Federal regulators
took it over in January and required Pinnacle West to infuse $465
million into the thrift before cutting ties to it.
   Snell also acknowledged problems with the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station, owned by the company's chief subsidiary,
Arizona Public Service Co. The three-reactor plant operated at only
24 percent of capacity last year.
   Snell said he plans to operate Palo Verde efficiently, raise
morale at APS, contain costs and improve relations with the Arizona
Corporation Commission, which regulates APS.
   It may be three years before dividends are restored, Snell said.
However, a stronger performance should strengthen the company's
stock price, he said.

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan plans to ask
states to ban cigarette vending machines and take other action to
limit sales to youth, government sources said Wednesday.
   Sullivan was to present his proposal at a Senate Finance
Committee hearing Thursday, said the sources, who spoke on the
condition they not be identified.
   ``It will be a proposal for the states to review'' and decide
upon, and Sullivan will not propose new federal legislation, said
one source.
   Another source said the secretary will propose that retailers be
licensed to sell cigarettes.
   Forty-four states and the District of Columbia prohibit the sale
of cigarettes to children, but the laws are widely unenforced.
   On May 16, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
approved a $110 million program aimed at encouraging states to
enforce laws against the sale of cigarettes to minors, including
restrictions on vending machines. The Bush administration in
February called the legislation unnecessary.
   A study in this week's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association estimated annual cigarette sales to youths
under age 18 at 947 million packs and revenues at $1.23 billion,
about 3.3 percent of all tobacco sales.
   Nearly 19 percent of high school seniors smoke daily _ 11
percent of them more than a half pack per day _ according to an
annual survey of high school seniors by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse's annual survey of high school seniors.
   Surveys have also shown that the vast majority of adult smokers
started in their teen years.
   Sullivan has made anti-smoking issues one of his top priorities
at the Department of Health and Human Services.
   In January, he took on R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for planning to
test market a cigarette aimed primarily at blacks, saying the
company was promoting ``a culture of cancer.'' The next day,
Reynolds canceled its plans.
   Then he called on professional athletes to turn away the ``blood
money'' from cigarette companies that sponsor sporting events.
   More recently, lawmakers were wondering if Sullivan had changed
his views on smoking when his assistant secretary for health, James
Mason, canceled his appearance at a congressional hearing on
cigarette exports, reportedly at the direction of the White House.
   But Sullivan said one of his top priorities remains ``to
eliminate the use of the only legal substance that when used as
intended causes death.''
   Cigarettes, the department says, cause about 390,000 premature
deaths annually from lung cancer, heart disease and other
cardiovascular disorders.

   Atlanta-based Contel Cellular Inc. announced it
has signed a joint venture agreement with a Hungarian company to
develop a cellular telephone system in that country.
   The joint venture with Hungaria Telekom Kft. will be named
Contel Hungaria Kft. Contel will split ownership equally with
private Hungarian partners within Hungaria Telekom while taking
principle managerial, technical and operational responsibilities.
   The new company has been granted an 15-year operating concession
from the Hungarian government with a five-year renewal option,
Contel said in a news release Wednesday.
   It will be the first national cellular system in Eastern Europe
and will be designed to provide service to at least 50,000
subscribers by 1993. The system will be designed to carry voice,
data, facsimile and fixed cellular applications.
   ``Contel Hungaria Kft. will provide telephone service to a
country with a tremendous demand for telecommunications service,''
said Paul Kozlowski, president and chief executive officer of
Contel Cellular. ``Our cellular system will be designed to
complement Hungary's existing wireline telephone network.''
   Charles Wholstetter, chairman of Contel Corp., which owns 90
percent of Contel Cellular, said, ``Our Hungarian venture typifies
the global view Contel takes of the cellular industry and the major
role cellular telecommunications will play around the world in the
future.''
   Contel Cellular already participates in a venture that provides
cellular service in parts of Mexico.

   Britain's Midland Bank PLC is
establishing a $1.5 billion fund of Brazilian bank debt to swap for
equity in state companies to be privatized by the government,
officials said.
   Wednesday's announcement by Nicholas Reade, Midland's
representative in Brazil, came during a conference on
privatizations organized by the British embassy in the capital.
   The fund, to be sponsored by several foreign banks, would be
ready by July and in operation in September, Reade said.
   Chase Manhattan Corp. and the Bank of Tokyo are discussing
becoming sponsors of the fund, and negotiations with other banks
that have loans to Brazil are continuing, he said.
   Midland is the country's largest British creditor with about $2
billion in loans. Brazil owes about $62 billion to commercial banks
worldwide and has a total foreign debt of $114 billion.
   Loan commitments made by the banks to the fund will be counted
at the original loans' face value, but debt-for-equity trades will
be negotiated, with a discounting of the debt's value expected, he
said. Most of Brazil's bank debt sells for less than half its face
value on the open market.
   The government, which has announced a wide-ranging privatization
program to cut a bloated public deficit, has considered selling off
most of the almost 200 state-run enterprises. These enterprises
have a combined deficit of $62 billion.
   Reade said the idea of creating a fund to participate in the
process of privatizing Brazilian state firms came about because of
the volume of capital needed, which no bank could provide alone.
   ``We prefer to unite our resources at the start of the process,
rather than create unions afterwards,'' he said.
   Another reason was the success of a similar fund organized by
Midland in Argentina, in which 12 large creditor banks
participated, he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Plans To Subpoena Former Thrift Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. House Banking Subcomittee voted
Wednesday to subpoena David L. Paul, ousted chairman of CenTrust
Savings Bank, as part of its investigation into the failure of the
huge Miami thrift.
   The decision followed months of effort to persuade Paul to
participate in its investigation into the huge thrift's failure. In
March, he declined to appear at a hearing the committee held on
CenTrust.
   Committee chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, had indicated then
he would consider subpoenaing Paul if the former banker continued
to refuse to appear. Wednesday's resolution doesn't set a date for
his appearance.
   Paul's lawyer, Sanford Bohrer, told The Miami Herald he hadn't
seen the resolution and had no comment on it.
   Paul built CenTrust into Florida's largest savings and loan. At
one point, it boasted assets of $11 billion.
   But he was sharply criticized for lavish salaries, extravagant
spending on the thrift's landmark tower in downtown Miami, and the
use of $30 million in bank funds to purchase a collection of fine
art.
   Federal regulators took CenTrust over Feb. 2, immediately
dismissing Paul. Some experts say the thrift's bailout, estimated
to cost $2 billion or more, will be the nation's most expensive.

   The House by a wide margin approved sweeping
clean air legislation late Wednesday, requiring tougher pollution
controls for factories, automobiles and electric power plants.
   The bill, the first revamping of federal air pollution controls
in 13 years, now must be reconciled with a similar Senate version
approved in April before going to President Bush for his signature.
   The final vote was 401-21.
   The way was cleared for House passage after daylong closed-door
negotiations led to a compromise easing a requirement for
alternate-fuel cars. The agreement erased the last obstacle to the
bill, which had been approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee
six weeks ago.
   While clean air legislation over the years has been one of the
most contentious issues before Congress, the broad-reaching bill
moved through floor action in less than two days. Most of the
thorniest issues had been resolved in committee or closed-door
negotations.
   Like the Senate version, the bill imposes tougher air pollution
controls on automobiles and industry, including curbs on acid rain
precursors from electric power plants and toxic industrial
chemicals. The costs of the legislation to the economic has been
put at more than $21.5 billion by the Bush administration when all
provisions go into effect.
   The vote approving the compromise on alternate-fuel cars was
405-15.
   Under the agreement, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chief backer
of the bill, agreed to abandon a proposal requiring automakers to
build 1 million cars annually that burn fuels other than gasoline.
   Instead, the production of such cars would be limited to a
``pilot program'' of up to 300,000 for the Los Angeles area, which
has the nation's worst smog, by 1997. Emission controls on fleet
vehicles and urban buses also would be toughened for many cities
with major smog problems.
   ``The last remaining issue has now been resolved,'' declared
Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., senior Republican on the Energy and
Commerce Committee, on the House floor.
   The House has struggled months to pass the sweeping clean air
bill, which will impose tougher air pollution controls on
automobiles and industry, including curbs on acid rain precursors
from electric power plants and toxic industrial chemicals. The
costs of the legislation to the economy has been put at more than
$21.5 billion by the Bush administration.
   The Senate passed a bill similar to the one before the House
last April. Differences between the two bills have to be worked out
in a conference committee of members from the House and Senate
before anything is laid before the president for signing into law.
Among other differences is the absence of any ``clean car''
provision in the Senate bill.
   Waxman's original ``clean car'' amendment would have applied to
nine cities with the worst smog problem: Los Angeles, Chicago, San
Diego, Milwaukee, Houston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City
and Hartford, Conn.
   Negotiations continued most of the day to find ways to
accommodate Waxman, who argued that his proposal for the mandatory
production of 1 million cars was little more what President Bush
had suggested a year ago. The White House has since abandoned
mandatory production requirements.
   The auto industry had vigorously fought the measure and had on
their side Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the powerful chairman of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, whose district includes Ford Motor
Co. headquarters.
   Dingell, calling the Waxman proposal ``the most contentuous
issue'' faced by the House, announced the compromise on the House
floor.
   Earlier the House by a 274-146 vote approved a $250 million
financial aid package over five years to help workers who lose
their jobs because of tougher air pollution controls.
   The job-loss relief measure came despite strong opposition from
the White House as Bush administration officials argued the measure
could be many times more expensive than expected.
   The plan would extend unemployment compensation for an
additional six months and provide retraining assistance at a cost
of $50 million a year for workers displaced by tighter air
pollution requirements.
   Unlike a proposal defeated in the Senate, it would provide
relief to workers in all industries and not just coal miners, but
the assistance is considerably more modest, said Rep. Bob Wise,
D-W.Va., sponsor of the measure.
   ``I think it's a matter of simple justice,'' argued Rep. Gerry
Sikorski, D-Minn.
   The worker assistance amendment was aimed primarily at helping
an estimated 5,000 coal miners who may lose their jobs to tougher
acid rain provisions in the legislation.
   Wise, however, emphasized that the financial aid would apply to
all industries. Critics of the bill have argued that there could be
widespread unemployment in some industries if plants close because
of tougher standards.
   Lent said the measure holds the environmental bill ``hostage to
labor protection.'' The Bush administration is expected to push to
delete the provision when differences between the House and Senate
bills are negotiated later this year.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu and William Reilly, head
of the Environmental Protection Agency, wrote House leaders that
such assistance ``would create a potentially open-ended liability''
for the government because it would be impossible to determine when
a worker loses employment because of clean air legislation.
   Meanwhile, the House put its formal approval on a series of
compromise amendments:
   _A provision requiring cleaner gasoline blends in cities with
the worst pollution. The oil industry opposed the tougher emission
standards, arguing they will require use of gasoline-ethanol blends.
   _A requirement for the Environmental Protection Agency to
develop new regional visibility regulations within two years for
many national parks and wilderness areas.
   _A requirement that offshore oil platforms off the California
coast and elsewhere outside the Gulf of Mexico adhere to federal
air pollution regulations. To please oil state congressmen,
platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, where most offshore oil is
drilled, were exempted.
   _A mandatory phaseout of chemicals such as chlorofluorcarbons,
or CFCs, as well as a number of substitutes.
   _A requirement that automakers provided expanded warranties up
to eight years and 80,000 miles on pollution control devices.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains, Stocks Ease</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices erased their opening gains and fell
modestly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday morning while the
dollar was slightly higher against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 56.47 points, or 0.18
percent, ending the morning session at 32,120.04. The index rose
238.21 points on Wednesday.
   The dollar closed the morning session at 151.55 yen, up from
Wednesday's close of 151.35 yen. The dollar started trading at
151.50 yen and ranged between 150.90 yen and 151.55 yen during the
morning.
   ``The (Nikkei) index took a downturn as market players stepped
off to the sidelines after buying actively in early trading,'' said
Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Investors were reluctant to buy ahead of announcements by major
companies of their performance during fiscal 1989, Hasunuma added.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was holding above the 151-yen
line after weakening slightly earlier as investors bought the yen
against the West German mark, dealers said.
   The price of the benchmark No.119 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 87.52 from Wednesday's close of 87.38. That dropped
the yield to 7.06 percent from 7.09 percent.
